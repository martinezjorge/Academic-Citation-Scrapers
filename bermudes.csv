David Bermudes|Epiphytic bromeliads as air quality monitors in south Florida|David H Benzing, David Bermudes|1991/1/1|Selbyana|||46-53|The Marie Selby Botanical Gardens|Three species of Tillandsia (Bromeliaceae) were surveyed at nine sites in south Florida to determine possible effects of air pollution. All three populations were healthy and reproductive. Most of the chemical elements examined in sampled foliage occurred at concentrations similar to those previously reported for the genus. However, one notable geographic trend was revealed: concentrations of S tended to be highest in mainland plants closest to the urbanized east coast. Continued use of these bromeliads and other Florida vascular epiphytes for air quality surveillance is recommended. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis inferred from the fossil record|David Bermudes, Richard C Back|1991|Margulis and Fester|||72-91||Fossil assemblages are notorious for their many biases. Notably, hard parts are more likely to be preserved than soft ones. The fossil record is largely a history of these hard parts from which past biology must be inferred. There is little direct evidence of symbiosis in the fossil record. Most microbial symbionts do not preserve well, and thus a host and a symbiont are seldom preserved together. Notable exceptions are the fungus-root associations found in Rhynie cherts dating to 400 million years ago (Kidston and Lang 1921; Boullard and Lemoigne 1971). These associations are sometimes interpreted as mutualistic mycorrhizae (Pirozynski and Malloch 1975; Malloch et al. 1980; Pirozynski and Dalpe 1989), although problems remain with interpretations of biological relationships based purely on morphology. Co-preservation insufficiently resolves the question of the influence of a biological relationship, and thus additional information must be sought. Actualistic assumptions have been applied to ecology (Mayr 1963) and genetics (Dobzhansky 1951) for the interpretation of the fossil record and, we believe, should be further extended to incorporate symbiosis. The field of symbiosis has long been a contributor to the understanding of biology (De Bary 1879; Mereschkovskii 1910; Wallin 1927), yet symbiosis remains largely peripheral to contemporary evolutionary theory. Several papers have already discussed the influence of symbiosis on evolutionary history (Taylor 1979, 1983; Cowen 1983; Margulis and Bermudes 1985; Bermudes and Margulis 1987). The purpose of this paper is to identify different ways in which symbiosis may have influenced … 
David Bermudes|Tumour therapy using Salmonella|I King, X Luo, M Feng, M Ittensohn, Z Li, M Belcourt, S Lin, T Le, J Pike, K Troy, M Sznol, C Clairmont, D Bermudes, LM Zheng|2000/7/1||5|2|211-219|Taylor & Francis|The development of novel therapies that are selective for cancer cells, with limited toxicity to normal tissues, has been a challenge for oncology researchers. Genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium, which is capable of multiplying selectively in tumours and inhibiting their growth, represents a new approach for cancer treatment. Because of its selectivity for tumour tissues, S. typhimurium would also be an ideal vector for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumours. VNP20009, an attenuated strain of S. typhimurium with deletions in msbB and purI genes, possesses desirable attributes, such as low toxicity, tumour-selective multiplication and an intrinsic tumouricidal activity, making it particularly promising. VNP20009 accumulates preferentially in tumours of mice bearing B16F10 melanoma and M019 lung carcinoma. This preferential accumulation also occurs in animals implanted sc. with human tumour xenografts …

We also found that unusual aspects of the plasmid include the inability to be completely digested with restriction endonucleases and asymmetric Phred DNA sequencing quality scores, with significantly lower scores in the forward direction relative to the colicin and immunity proteins consistent with plus (+) strand DNA. Comparing the A260 with picogreen double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fluorescence and oligreen single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fluorescence as well as metachromatic staining by acridine orange, we found that the undigested pColE3 DNA stains preferentially as ssDNA … 
David Bermudes|The role of parasites in generating evolutionary novelty|D Bermudes, Keith A Joiner|1993/12/1||9|12|458-463|Elsevier Current Trends|In this review, David Bermudes and Keith joiner discuss the interrelationship between parasitism and mutualism and examine the parallel mechanisms used by parasites and mutualists to access and persist within the intracellular environment. By drawing analogies with mutualistic associations, they suggest mechanisms by which some parasites may ultimately benefit their hosts. They further speculate that some hosts may even become dependent upon their parasites. 
David Bermudes|In vitro antagonism of bioluminescent fungi by Trichoderma harzianum|David Bermudes, Martin E Boraas, Kenneth H Nealson|1991/7/1|Mycopathologia|115|1|19-29|Kluwer Academic Publishers|Two species of bioluminescent fungi, Panellus stypticus and Omphalotus olearius were placed in contact with three different strains of interfungal pathogenic Trichoderma harzianum. Subsequent light emission by the luminous fungi and advance of the interfungal pathogens were compared. Relative differences among the pathogens were reflected in their rate of mycelial advance, the total area over which they produced spores upon the host fungi, and decreases in host bioluminescence. After ten days differences in the total surface areas of spore production varied from 1 to 53 per cent. Differences in the reduction of bioluminescence of the same material ranged over 2 orders of magnitude. Final reduction in luminescence ranged over 6 orders of magnitude. A marked reduction in bioluminescence was observed to precede the advance of spore production. The greatest reduction in luminescence was … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-targeted Salmonella as a novel anticancer vector|John M Pawelek, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|1997/10/15|Cancer research|57|20|4537-4544|American Association for Cancer Research|There has been little investigation of bacteria as gene delivery vectors. Here, we demonstrate that genetically engineered Salmonella have many of the desirable properties of a delivery vector, including targeting of multiple tumors from a distant inoculation site, selective replication within tumors, tumor retardation, and the ability to express effector genes, such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK). When wild-type Salmonella were introduced into melanoma-bearing mice, the bacteria were found within the tumor at levels exceeding 109 per g, although as pathogens, they caused the death of the mice. However, when attenuated, hyperinvasive auxotrophic mutants were used, the tumor-targeting and amplification phenomena were retained, whereas their pathogenicity was limited. With such attenuated strains, the tumor:liver ratios ranged between 250:1 and 9000:1. When these auxotrophs were … 
David Bermudes|Lipid A mutant Salmonella with suppressed virulence and TNFα induction retain tumor-targeting in vivo|K Brooks Low, Martina Ittensohn, Trung Le, James Platt, Stefano Sodi, Max Amoss, Olivia Ash, Ellen Carmichael, Ashok Chakraborty, Jessica Fischer, Stanley L Lin, Xiang Luo, Samuel I Miller, Li-mou Zheng, Ivan King, John M Pawelek, David Bermudes|1999/1|Nature biotechnology|17|1|37|Nature Publishing Group|Systemically administered tumor-targeted Salmonella has been developed as an anticancer agent, although its use could be limited by the potential induction of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-mediated septic shock stimulated by lipid A. Genetic modifications of tumor-targeting Salmonella that alter lipid A and increase safety must, however, retain the useful properties of this bacteria. We report here that disruption of the Salmonella msbB gene reduces TNFα induction and increases the LD 50 of this pathogenic bacteria by 10,000-fold. Notwithstanding this enormous difference, Salmonella retains its tumor-targeting properties, exhibiting tumor accumulation ratios in excess of 1000: 1 compared with normal tissues. Administration of this bacteria to mice bearing melanoma results in tumors that are less than 6% the size of tumors in untreated controls at day 18. Thus, the antitumor activity previously demonstrated using … 
David Bermudes|Bacteria as tumour-targeting vectors|John M Pawelek, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2003/9/1||4|9|548-556|Elsevier|Live bacteria were first actively used in the treatment of cancer nearly 150 years ago, work that ultimately led to the study of immunomodulation. Today, with the discovery of bacterial strains that specifically target tumours, and aided by genomic sequencing and genetic engineering, there is new interest in the use of bacteria as tumour vectors. Bifodobacterium, Clostridium, and Salmonella have all been shown to preferentially replicate within solid tumours when injected from a distal site, and all three types of bacteria have been used to transport and amplify genes encoding factors such as prodrug-converting enzymes, toxins, angiogenesis inhibitors, and cytokines. In this review we provide a historical discussion of this area, and describe the development of the bacteria, which are currently being prepared for use in clinical trials in patients with cancer. 
David Bermudes|Biodistribution and Genetic Stability of the Novel Antitumor Agent VNP20009, a Genetically Modified Strain of Salmonella typhimuvium|C Clairmont, KC Lee, J Pike, M Ittensohn, KB Low, J Pawelek, D Bermudes, SM Brecher, D Margitich, J Turnier, Z Li, X Luo, I King, LM Zheng|2000/6/1|Journal of Infectious Diseases|181|6|1996-2002|The University of Chicago Press|VNP20009 is a genetically modified strain of Salmonella typhimurium possessing an excellent safety profile, including genetically stable attenuated virulence (a deletion in the purl gene), reduction of septic shock potential (a deletion in the msbB gene), and antibiotic susceptibility. VNP20009 is genetically stable after multiple generations in vitro and in vivo. In mice, VNP20009 is rapidly cleared from the blood from a peak level of 1 × 104 cfu/mL to undetectable levels in 24 h. In tumor-bearing mice, VNP20009 accumulates preferentially in tumors over livers at a ratio of 1000 : 1. In nonhuman primates, VNP20009 was also rapidly cleared from the blood, from a peak level of 1.0 × 106 cfu/mL to undetectable levels in 24 h. VNP20009 was detected in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of monkeys; the amount decreased over time, and VNP20009 was cleared from all organs by day 41; no VNP20009 could be … 
David Bermudes|In vivo maintenance of synergistic cytarabine: daunorubicin ratios greatly enhances therapeutic efficacy|Paul Tardi, Sharon Johnstone, Natashia Harasym, Sherwin Xie, Troy Harasym, Natalia Zisman, Pierrot Harvie, David Bermudes, Lawrence Mayer|2009/1/1|Leukemia research|33|1|129-139|Pergamon|We demonstrate here that cytarabine and daunorubicin, a standard drug combination used in the treatment of leukaemia, exhibits drug ratio-dependent synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. A cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratio of 5:1 displayed the greatest degree of synergy and minimum antagonism in a panel of 15 tumor cell lines in vitro. Co-encapsulating cytarabine and daunorubicin inside liposomes maintained the synergistic drug ratio in plasma for 24 h post-injection. Liposome-encapsulated cytarabine:daunorubicin combinations exhibited drug ratio-dependent in vivo efficacy with the 5:1 molar drug ratio (designated CPX-351) having the greatest therapeutic index, despite using sub-MTD daunorubicin doses. CPX-351 exhibited superior therapeutic activity compared to free-drug cocktails, with high proportions of long-term survivors, consistent with in vivo synergy. The therapeutic advantage of … 
David Bermudes|Kinetics and pattern of organelle exocytosis duringToxoplasma gondii/host-cell interaction|Jean François Dubremetz, Abderrahim Achbarou, David Bermudes, Keith A Joiner|1993/5/1|Parasitology research|79|5|402-408|Springer-Verlag|The fate ofToxoplasma gondii dense-granule (GRA2, GRA3), rhoptry (ROP1), and surface (SAG1) proteins was followed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunoelectron microscopy at different stages after infection. Dense-granule exocytosis occurred in the apical area of the tachyzoite within minutes of invasion. Several exocytic events were found simultaneously in the same organism, both by serial sectioning and by freeze-fracture studies. Dense-granule contents were first found as a dense material trapped between parasite and vacuole membranes before either the vacuolar network or the vacuole membrane could be immunolabeled with specific antibodies. The vacuolar network was strongly labeled with dense-granule antibodies but not with the SAG1-specific probe, which suggests that the network is not enriched in membrane proteins. In addition to strongly labeling the vacuole membrane … 
David Bermudes|Use of preferentially replicating bacteria for the treatment of cancer|Mario Sznol, Stanley L Lin, David Bermudes, Li-mou Zheng, Ivan King|2000/4/15|The Journal of clinical investigation|105|8|1027-1030|American Society for Clinical Investigation|About 40 years ago, the observation was made that conditions within experimental animal tumors could favor the preferential replication of bacteria. 9, 10) or, in the case of metastatic models, after small lung metastases were established (11), tumor growth was inhibited in most models for prolonged periods, in some cases up to 50–60 days. Several of the models showed improved survival times, but tumors eventually resumed growth, resulting in the death of the animals. The tumor site-related and systemic toxicities reported in preclinical studies of strictly anaerobic bacteria were not observed, although after a prolonged period, some subcutaneous tumors developed a central necrotic region. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis as a mechanism of evolution: status of cell symbiosis theory.|Lynn Margulis, D Bermudes|1985||1||101-124||Several theories for the origin of eukaryotic (nucleated) cells from prokaryotic (bacterial) ancestors have been published: the progenote, the direct filiation and the serial endosymbiotic theory (SET). Compelling evidence for two aspects of the SET is now available suggesting that both mitochondria and plastids originated by symbioses with a third type of microbe, probably a Thermoplasma-like archaebacterium ancestral to the nucleocytoplasm. We conclude that not enough information is available to negate or substantiate another SET hypothesis: that the undulipodia (cilia, eukaryotic flagella) evolved from spirochetes. Recognizing the power of symbiosis to recombine in single individual semes from widely differing partners, we develop the idea that symbiosis has been important in the origin of species and higher taxa. The abrupt origin of novel life forms through the formation of stable symbioses is consistent with certain patterns of evolution (eg punctuated equilibria) described by some paleontologists. 
David Bermudes|Tandemly repeated genes encode nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase isoforms secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole of Toxoplasma gondii.|David Bermudes, K Ran Peck, M Afifi Afifi, CJ Beckers, Keith A Joiner|1994/11/18|Journal of Biological Chemistry|269|46|29252-29260|American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii produces a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase)(nucleoside-triphosphatase, EC 3.6. 1.15) activable by dithiol-containing compounds. We have isolated the genomic DNA for the NTPase from the RH strain of Toxoplasma and determined the nucleotide sequence of three tandemly arranged open reading frames termed NTP1, NTP2, and NTP3. We have also isolated and sequenced cDNAs for NTP1 and NTP3; no cDNA for NTP2 was obtained. The two cDNA clones encode proteins that are more than 97% identical at the amino acid level but significantly differ within two small domains, indicating the presence of NTPase isoforms. Both possess N-terminal signal sequences and two regions with partial homology to certain known ATP binding motifs: the glycine-rich loop common to many ATP binding proteins and the beta-phosphate binding domain found … 
David Bermudes|Modulating the therapeutic activity of nanoparticle delivered paclitaxel by manipulating the hydrophobicity of prodrug conjugates|Steven M Ansell, Sharon A Johnstone, Paul G Tardi, Lily Lo, Sherwin Xie, Yu Shu, Troy O Harasym, Natashia L Harasym, Laura Williams, David Bermudes, Barry D Liboiron, Walid Saad, Robert K Prud’homme, Lawrence D Mayer|2008/5/9|Journal of medicinal chemistry|51|11|3288-3296|American Chemical Society|A series of paclitaxel prodrugs designed for formulation in lipophilic nanoparticles are described. The hydrophobicity of paclitaxel was increased by conjugating a succession of increasingly hydrophobic lipid anchors to the drug using succinate or diglycolate cross-linkers. The prodrugs were formulated in well defined block copolymer-stabilized nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to have an elimination half-life of approximately 24 h in vivo. The rate at which the prodrug was released from the nanoparticles could be controlled by adjusting the hydrophobicity of the lipid anchor, resulting in release half-lives ranging from 1 to 24 h. The diglycolate and succinate cross-linked prodrugs were 1−2 orders of magnitude less potent than paclitaxel in vitro. Nanoparticle formulations of the succinate prodrugs showed no evidence of efficacy in HT29 human colorectal tumor xenograph models. Efficacy of diglycolate …

Fusion hybrids were generated in vitro between weakly metastatic Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells and normal mouse or human macrophages. Hybrids were implanted s.c. in the tail and mice were monitored for metastases. Controls included parental S91 cells, autologous S91 × S91 hybrids, and B16F10 melanoma cells. Of 35 hybrids tested, most were more aggressive than the parental melanoma cells, producing metastases sooner and in more mice. A striking characteristic was heterogeneity amongst hybrids, with some lines producing no metastases and others producing metastases in up to 80% of mice. With few exceptions, hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also had the highest basal …

VNP20009-TK were able to selectively localize within murine tumor models and to effectively sequester a radiolabeled nucleoside analogue, 2′-fluoro-1-β-D-arabino-furanosyl-5-iodo-uracil (FIAU). A quantitative relationship between the level of radioactivity accumulated and the number of bacteria in tumor and different tissues was demonstrated. The in vivo accumulation of [14 C] FIAU measured in tissue sample homogenates and sections were related to Salmonella number and to immunohistochemical bacterial staining, respectively. Quantitative autoradiography (QAR) revealed the relative intensity of [14 C] FIAU accumulation in a tumor cross-section, demonstrating that the peripheral region of the tumor … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-targeted Salmonella expressing cytosine deaminase as an anticancer agent|Ivan King, David Bermudes, Stanley Lin, Michael Belcourt, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy, Trung Le, Martina Ittensohn, John Mao, Wenshang Lang, Jacob D Runyan, Xiang Luo, Zujin Li, Li-Mou Zheng|2002/7/1|Human gene therapy|13|10|1225-1233|Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.|The study was designed to evaluate whether TAPET-CD, an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium expressing Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD), was capable of converting nontoxic 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the active antitumor agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration. TAPET-CD accumulated in tumors at levels 1000-fold higher than that in normal tissues and high levels of 5-FU were detected in tumors in mice treated with both TAPET-CD and 5-FC. No 5-FU could be detected in normal tissues. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with either TAPET-CD alone or TAPET-CD in combination with 5-FC (TAPET-CD/5-FC … 
David Bermudes|Live bacteria as anticancer agents and tumor-selective protein delivery vectors.|David Bermudes, LM Zheng, Ivan C King|2002/3||5|2|194-199||The development of novel cancer therapies that are selective for cancer cells with limited toxicity to normal tissues is a challenge for oncology researchers. Microorganisms, such as viruses with selectivity for tumor cells or tumor micro-environments, have been investigated as potential arsenals for decades. Genetically-modified, non-pathogenic bacteria have begun to emerge as potential antitumor agents, either to provide direct tumoricidal effects or to deliver tumoricidal molecules. Attenuated Salmonella, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium are capable of multiplying selectively in tumors and inhibiting their growth, representing a new approach for cancer treatment. Because of their selectivity for tumor tissues, these bacteria would also be ideal vectors for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumors. VNP20009, an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, and its derivative, TAPET-CD, which expresses an Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD), are particularly promising, and are currently undergoing phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.

VNP20009 inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted B16F10 murine melanoma, and the human tumor xenografts Lox, DLD-1, A549, WiDr, HTB177, and MDA-MB-231. A single intravenous injection of VNP20009, at doses ranging from 1 × 104 to 3 × 106 cfu/mouse, produced tumor growth inhibitions of 57–95%. Tumor volume doubling time, another indicator for tumor growth inhibition, also significantly increased in mice treated with VNP20009. Using mice with immune system deficiencies, we also demonstrated that the antitumor effects of VNP20009 did not depend on the presence of T and B cells. In addition, VNP20009, given intravenously, inhibited the growth of lung metastases in mice. Only live bacteria showed the …

This selectivity occurred in subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, including B16F10 melanoma, M27 lung carcinoma, and colon 38 carcinoma. The preferential accumulation was also manifested in animals bearing human tumor xenografts, including Lox, C8186, DLD1, SW620, HCT116, HTB177, DU145, MDA-MB-231, and Caki. Four to five days after a single IV injection of 1 × 106 colony-forming unit (cfu)/mouse, we routinely detected VNP20009 proliferation and accumulation at levels ranging from 1 × 108 to 2 × 109 cfu/g tumor. The amount of VNP20009 accumulated in the liver ranged from 3 × 104 to 2 × 106 cfu/g. The distribution of Salmonella in tumors … 
David Bermudes|Do prokaryotes contain microtubules?|David Bermudes, Gregory Hinkle, Lynn Margulis|1994/9/1|Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.|58|3|387-400|American Society for Microbiology|In eukaryotic cells, microtubules are 24-nm-diameter tubular structures composed of a class of conserved proteins called tubulin. They are involved in numerous cell functions including ciliary motility, nerve cell elongation, pigment migration, centrosome formation, and chromosome movement. Although cytoplasmic tubules and fibers have been observed in bacteria, some with diameters similar to those of eukaryotes, no homologies to eukaryotic microtubules have been established. Certain groups of bacteria including azotobacters, cyanobacteria, enteric bacteria, and spirochetes have been frequently observed to possess microtubule-like structures, and others, including archaebacteria, have been shown to be sensitive to drugs that inhibit the polymerization of microtubules. Although little biochemical or molecular biological information is available, the differences observed among these prokaryotic structures …

We investigated whether the efficacy of this combination could be improved by controlling drug ratios following in vivo administration. Irinotecan and cisplatin combinations were evaluated systematically for drug ratio–dependent synergy in vitro using a panel of 20 tumor cell lines. In vitro screening informatics on drug ratio–dependent cytotoxicity identified a consistently antagonistic region between irinotecan/cisplatin molar ratios of 1:2 to 4:1, which was bordered by two synergistic regions. Liposomal co-formulations of these two agents were developed that exhibited plasma drug half-lives of ∼6 hours and maintained a fixed drug ratio for more than 24 hours. Drug ratio–dependent antitumor activity was shown in vivo for these liposome formulations, and irinotecan … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-Targeted Salmonella|David Bermudes, Brooks Low, John Pawelek|2002||||57-63|Springer, Boston, MA|Genetically engineered Salmonella offer an intriguing new approach to selectively target solid tumors, including melanoma, lung, colon, breast, kidney and liver. These bacteria target tumors after systemic administration and selectively replicate within them. Specificity for tumors is often more than 1,000 times greater than for any other tissue. Auxotrophic mutations make these bacteria highly safe and form the basis for maintaining tumor specificity. An altered lipid greatly reduces the potential for septic shock yet also retains the antitumor properties of these bacteria. These bacteria have innate antitumor activity towards both primary and metastatic tumors and the ability to deliver proteins capable of activating chemotherapeutic agents directly within tumors. The delay in tumor growth results in mice that survive up to twice as long. These bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, allowing external … 
David Bermudes|Antitumour effects of genetically engineered Salmonella in combination with radiation|J Platt, S Sodi, M Kelley, S Rockwell, D Bermudes, KB Low, J Pawelek|2000/12/1|European Journal of Cancer|36|18|2397-2402|Pergamon|The antitumour efficacy of lipid A mutant Salmonella was evaluated alone and in combination with X-rays in mice bearing B16F10 or Cloudman S91 melanomas. Each treatment alone slowed tumour growth and prolonged survival, and the combined treatments produced supra-additive antitumour effects. That is, in dose–response studies with single doses of Salmonella and increasing doses of radiation, the two agents together caused suppression of tumour growth that was greater than that calculated for additivity. The results suggest that the combination of these genetically engineered Salmonella with radiotherapy could be a new and beneficial treatment for solid tumours.

A bone marrow-engrafting CCRF-CEM leukemia model in Rag2-M mice was utilized to correlate the therapeutic and myelosuppressive properties of CPX-351 with bone marrow delivery and drug uptake in leukemia cells relative to normal bone marrow cell populations. When administered to mice bearing CCRF-CEM human leukemia xenografts, CPX-351 ablated bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells to below detectable levels for multiple weeks, whereas the free-drug cocktail only transiently suppressed leukemia growth. In contrast to the activity against leukemia cells, CPX-351 and free-drug cocktail induced similar myelosuppression in non-tumor-bearing BM …

Benzing, David H., Givnish, T.J. and Bermudes|1985|Systematic Botany|10|1|81-91||Brocchinia reducta, a tank-forming member of subfamily Pitcairnioideae (Bromeliaceae), possesses foliar trichomes capable of absorbing 3H-leucine as do those borne by other members of the same family (all Tillandsioideae and some species of Bromelioideae). In general, pitcairnioid trichomes have been considered incapable of participating in nutrient uptake. Other features of leaf anatomy and physiology, such as the presence of the C3 photosynthetic pathway, suggest that either 1) Brocchinia and tillandsioid tank shoots bearing absorptive hairs are a result of convergence or 2) both subfamilies acquired this feature from the same ancestor. All in all, Tillandsioideae and Pitcairnioideae share more vegetative features in common than either does with Bromelioideae and, thus, may be more closely related than was previously suspected. Tank deployment in Bromelioideae seems to have originated independently …

David Bermudes|Cloning of a cDNA encoding the dense granule protein GRA3 from Toxoplasma gondii|David Bermudes, Jean-François Dubremetz, Abderrahim Achbarou, Keith A Joiner|1994/12/1|Molecular and biochemical parasitology|68|2|247-257|Elsevier|GRA3 is a 30-kDa protein located inside the dense granules of Toxoplasma gondii. Following invasion and exocytosis of dense granules within the parasitophorous vacuole, GRA3 becomes associated with the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and extensions of the PVM which protrude into the cytoplasm. A partial cDNA encoding GRA3 was isolated from a Toxoplasma gondii expression library using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the mature GRA3 protein of tachyzoites. Antibodies affinity purified using the cloned fusion protein reacted with a 30-kDa band on immunoblots and recognized dense granules, the PVM, and PVM extensions by immunofluorescence staining of infected cells. Northern blot analysis indicated the major transcript was of a slightly larger size, and the complete cDNA encoding GRA3 was subsequently obtained. Southern blot analysis suggests that GRA3 is present as a …

David Bermudes|Upstream elements required for expression of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase genes of Toxoplasma gondii|Valerian Nakaar, David Bermudes, Kyong Ran Peck, Keith A Joiner|1998/5/1|Molecular and biochemical parasitology|92|2|229-239|Elsevier|Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase is an abundant protein secreted by the obligate protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The protein has apyrase activity, degrading ATP to the di- and mono-phosphate forms. Because T. gondii is incapable of de novo synthesis of purines, it is postulated that NTPase may be used by the parasite to salvage purines from the host cell for survival and replication. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of NTP gene expression, we isolated from the virulent RH strain of T. gondii the putative promoter region of three tandemly repeated NTP genes (NTP1, 2, 3). Using deletion constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, we defined an active promoter within the first 220 bp. Sequence analysis of this region reveals the lack of a TATA box, but the promoter region is associated with a sequence which resembles an initiator element (Inr) in the NTP1 and …

All anaerobic respiratory functions were restored by complementation of the mutants with specific cloned DNA fragments. Southern hybridization experiments revealed that the fragment that complements the MR-1 mutant was localized on the megaplasmids of both strains, while the fragment that complements the sp200 mutant was chromosomal. Neither of these fragments hybridized with the anaerobic regulatory genes of S. putrefaciens (etrA) or E. coli (fnr).

Hyphae were also common in and on nonorchid roots, but assignments of these relationships to known mycorrhizal morphologies was not possible in all cases. Evidence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) existed in a number of subjects while in Ericaceae and Campanulaceae a fungal association similar to the demateaceous surface fungi (DSF) described for alpine and prarie plants was usually present.

The culture was non-luminous growing submerged in defined liquid media with or without agitation. After a two- to three-day lag period on solid substrata, luminescence increased exponentially with a doubling time of 4 hours while the increase in colony radial growth was linear. On solid substrata, growth and total light emission were strongly correlated under most conditions studied. Optimal conditions included darkness; 28 C; pH 3.8; glucose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose or pectin as carbon source; and ammonia or asparagine as nitrogen source. Growth and luminescence were inhibited by ambient fluorescent light. Dark-grown colonies were brightest in the center while light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery …

A mutation that functions to constitutively activate pmrA [pmrA(Con)] suppresses msbB growth defects on EGTA-containing media. Lipid A structural analysis showed that Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains, compared to Salmonella msbB strains, have increased amounts of palmitate and phosphoethanolamine but no aminoarabinose addition, suggesting that aminoarabinose is not incorporated into msbB lipid A. Surprisingly, loss-of-function mutations in the aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes restored EGTA and polymyxin sensitivity to Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains. These blocks in aminoarabinose biosynthesis also prevented lipid A phosphoethanolamine incorporation and reduced the levels of palmitate addition …

Genetically modified, nonpathogenic Salmonella offer a potential way to induce direct tumoricidal activity or to deliver tumoricidal agents to tumors. An attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, called VNP20009, and its derivative TAPET-CD (which expresses Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase) are highly selective for tumor tissue and can deliver therapeutic proteins preferentially to tumors in preclinical models. Both VNP20009 and TAPET-CD have been investigated successfully in Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer patients.

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer-specific molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anti-cancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer... specific targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufficiently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce significant therapeutic effects. Recent findings suggest that the pathogenic bacteriumSallnonella, when genetically modified, can be used to …

Luminescence, varying among species, occurs in either the basidiocarp, the mycelium, the spores, or in combinations thereof (see O'Kane et al., 1990). Photometers have long been used to study bioluminescence (see Reynolds, 1972); however, perception ofluminescence in fungi has been largely by eye and/or documented photographically. Use of photometric measurements has generally been restricted to physiological studies of common species and examinations of the possible occurrence of bioluminescence in species suggested to be luminous (eg, Bermudes et al., 1990). Knowledge of the distribution of fungal luminescence, therefore, has been generally restricted by the detection limits of the human eye. Bioluminescence in fungi ranges …

David Bermudes|Symbiont acquisition as neoseme: origin of species and higher taxa.|D Bermudes, L Margulis|1987|Symbiosis (Philadelphia, Pa.)|4||185-198||We examine the hypothesis that, in the origin of species and higher taxa of eukaryotes, symbiont acquisition followed by partner integration has been equivalent to neoseme appearance leading to speciation. The formation of stable symbiotic associations involves partner-surface recognition, behavioral and metabolic interaction, and, in some cases, gene product (RNA, protein) and genic (RNA, DNA) integration. This analysis is applied here to examples of neosemes that define specific taxa and to neosemes in plants, fungi, and animals that involve the appearance of new types of tissue. If this hypothesis is correct--if the origin of major genetic variation leading to speciation and even higher taxa may occur through symbiont acquisition and integration--then the analysis of" origins of species and higher taxa" becomes analogous to the study of microbial community ecology.

It is hypothesized that mice would be more susceptible than other animal species to the toxic effects of VNP20009, because mice are the most sensitive natural host for the parental wild-type Salmonella typhimurium strain. These studies also compared the virulence of VNP20009 and the parental Salmonella in mice. In Cynomolgus monkeys and Yorkshire pigs (n = 2/dose), various doses (expressed as colony forming units [cfu] per animal) of VNP20009, or vehicle, were administered as a single IV injection (∼ 1 ml/min). The body weight, body temperature, clinical signs, clinical pathology (serum chemistry and hematology), and ophthalmic examinations (only in monkeys) were evaluated at various times.

Luminous single-spore isolates exhibited varying levels of luminescence, and in some single-spore isolates, a delay in the onset of luminescence was observed. Japanese and eastern North American collections were universally sexually compatible, and thus belong to the same biological species. Nuclear migration beyond the contact zone between crossed single-spore strains was only occasionally observed, and was consistently accompanied by hyphal lysis of the receptor strain. Production of nuclei fit for nuclear migration appeared strain-specific, and not related to mating type genes.

Although the formulation demonstrated enhanced cisplatin tumor accumulation in preclinical models it did not enhance clinical efficacy, possibly due to limited cisplatin release from the formulation localized within the tumor. We have examined a series of liposomal formulations to address the in vivo relationship between cisplatin release rate and formulation efficacy in the P388 murine leukemia model. The base formulation of phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylglycerol: cholesterol was altered in the C18 and C16 phospholipid content to influence membrane fluidity and thereby impacting drug circulation lifetime and drug retention. Phase transition temperatures (Tm) ranged from 42–55°C. The high Tm formulations demonstrated enhanced drug retention properties accompanied by low antitumor activity while the lowest Tm formulations released the drug too rapidly in the plasma, limiting drug delivery to the tumor which also resulted in low antitumor activity. A formulation composed of DSPC : DPPC : DSPG : Chol; (35 : 35 : 20 : 10) with an intermediate drug release rate and a cisplatin plasma half-life of 8.3 hours showed the greatest antitumor activity. This manuscript highlights the critical role that drug release rates play in the design of an optimized drug delivery vehicle.

Long, hollow structures each comgosed of 13 protofilaments as revealed by electron microscopy, microtubules (240 A in diameter) are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes. These proteins have been the subject of intense biochemical and biophysical interest since the early 1970~’~ and are of evolutionary interest as well (eg, References 27 and 29). If tubulin-based structures (ie, neurotubules, mitotic spindle tubules, centrioles, kinetosomes, axonemes, etc.) evolved from spirochetes by way of motility symbioses, tubulin homologies with spirochete proteins should be detectable (see Reference 4). Tubulin proteins are widely thought to be limited to eukaryotes (eg, Reference 36). Yet both azotobacters’ and have shown immunological crossreactivity with antitubulin antibodies.

Numerous physical barriers exist in the delivery of therapeutic agents (including drugs, viruses, and liposomes) to solid tumors that can compromise the effectiveness (1), thus stimulating the search for alternative methods of delivery. Whereas it has been known for some time that spores of anaerobic Clostridium can germinate within the necrotic spaces of human tumors, they are limited to larger hypoxic tumors and are inaccessible to smaller metastases (2,3). The ability of motile, facultatively anaerobic Salmonella to target tumors following systemic administration, preferentially amplify within them, and express effector genes such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO 2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|Verena Karsten, Sean R Murray, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2009/12|BMC microbiology|9|1|170|BioMed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high osmolarity …

MsbB− salmonellae mutate extragenically to EGTA-tolerant derivatives at a frequency of 10−4 per division. One of these derivatives arose from inactivation of somA, which suppresses sensitivity to salt and EGTA. Here we show that a second mode of MsbB− suppression is a RecA-dependent deletion between two IS200 insertion elements present in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 but not in two other wild-type strains, LT2 and SL1344, which lack one of the IS200 elements. This deletion occurs spontaneously in wild-type and MsbB− strain 14028 salmonellae and accounts for about one-third of all of the spontaneous …

David Bermudes|Symbiosis inferred from the fossil record|David Bermudes, Richard C Back|1991|Margulis and Fester|||72-91||Fossil assemblages are notorious for their many biases. Notably, hard parts are more likely to be preserved than soft ones. The fossil record is largely a history of these hard parts from which past biology must be inferred. There is little direct evidence of symbiosis in the fossil record. Most microbial symbionts do not preserve well, and thus a host and a symbiont are seldom preserved together. Notable exceptions are the fungus-root associations found in Rhynie cherts dating to 400 million years ago (Kidston and Lang 1921; Boullard and Lemoigne 1971). These associations are sometimes interpreted as mutualistic mycorrhizae (Pirozynski and Malloch 1975; Malloch et al. 1980; Pirozynski and Dalpe 1989), although problems remain with interpretations of biological relationships based purely on morphology. Co-preservation insufficiently resolves the question of the influence of a biological relationship, and thus additional information must be sought. Actualistic assumptions have been applied to ecology (Mayr 1963) and genetics (Dobzhansky 1951) for the interpretation of the fossil record and, we believe, should be further extended to incorporate symbiosis. The field of symbiosis has long been a contributor to the understanding of biology (De Bary 1879; Mereschkovskii 1910; Wallin 1927), yet symbiosis remains largely peripheral to contemporary evolutionary theory. Several papers have already discussed the influence of symbiosis on evolutionary history (Taylor 1979, 1983; Cowen 1983; Margulis and Bermudes 1985; Bermudes and Margulis 1987). The purpose of this paper is to identify different ways in which symbiosis may have influenced …

Subsequent light emission by the luminous fungi and advance of the interfungal pathogens were compared. Relative differences among the pathogens were reflected in their rate of mycelial advance, the total area over which they produced spores upon the host fungi, and decreases in host bioluminescence. After ten days differences in the total surface areas of spore production varied from 1 to 53 per cent. Differences in the reduction of bioluminescence of the same material ranged over 2 orders of magnitude. Final reduction in luminescence ranged over 6 orders of magnitude. A marked reduction in bioluminescence was observed to precede the advance of spore production. The greatest reduction in luminescence was …

Since the pharmacokinetic behavior of the individual drugs cannot be controlled when administered in a conventional aqueous based cocktail, drug delivery systems must be utilized to maintain optimal drug ratios. We report here the development of nanoparticle delivery systems for hydrophobic drugs where plasma drug levels can be controlled in a manner that can be readily adapted to deliver drug combinations. Paclitaxel is a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug that is typically used in combination with other agents to treat breast, lung and ovarian cancer. Poor drug solubility necessitates its formulation into a mixture of Cremophor and ethanol. Toxicity associated with the use of Cremophor has resulted in formulation efforts using polymer micelles or …

David Bermudes|Tumour-targeting bacteria engineered to fight cancer|Shibin Zhou, Claudia Gravekamp, David Bermudes, Ke Liu|2018/11/7||||1|Nature Publishing Group|Recent advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy have once again raised the hope that a cure might be within reach for many cancer types. Yet, most late-stage cancers are either insensitive to the therapies to begin with or develop resistance later. Therapy with live tumour-targeting bacteria provides a unique option to meet these challenges. Compared with most other therapeutics, the effectiveness of tumour-targeting bacteria is not directly affected by the ‘genetic makeup’of a tumour. Bacteria initiate their direct antitumour effects from deep within the tumour, followed by innate and adaptive antitumour immune responses. As microscopic ‘robotic factories’, bacterial vectors can be reprogrammed following simple genetic rules or sophisticated synthetic bioengineering principles to produce and deliver anticancer agents on the basis of clinical needs. Therapeutic approaches using live tumour-targeting … 
David Bermudes|EGFR‐targeted Chimeras of Pseudomonas ToxA released into the extracellular milieu by attenuated Salmonella selectively kill tumor cells|David Quintero, Jamie Carrafa, Lena Vincent, David Bermudes|2016/12|Biotechnology and bioengineering|113|12|2698-2711||Tumor‐targeted Salmonella VNP20009 preferentially replicate within tumor tissue and partially suppress tumor growth in murine tumor models. These Salmonella have the ability to locally induce apoptosis when they are in direct contact with cancer cells but they lack significant bystander killing, which may correlate with their overall lack of antitumor activity in human clinical studies. In order to compensate for this deficiency without enhancing overall toxicity, we engineered the bacteria to express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐targeted cytotoxic proteins that are released into the extracellular milieu. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of the Salmonella strain VNP20009 to produce three different forms of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ToxA) chimeric with a tumor growth factor alpha (TGFα) which results in its producing culture supernatants that are cytotoxic and induce apoptosis in EGFR positive … 
David Bermudes|A culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors|David Quintero, David Bermudes|2014/5/1|Journal of microbiological methods|100||105-110|Elsevier|We have developed a culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors. The assay utilizes standard proteolysis detection plates to support microbial growth followed by infiltrating the plate with a protease and subsequently detecting the remaining protein by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, or by bromocreosol green (BCG) or Ponseau S (PS) staining. The presence of a protease inhibitor can be observed in the form of a protected zone of protein around the protease inhibitor-producing strain. Using the protease inhibitors α-2-macroglobulin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and bestatin and the primary and secondary forms of Photorhabdus luminescens in combination with the protease trypsin, we were able to demonstrate that the assay is specific for the cognate inhibitor of the protease and for bacteria secreting protease inhibitors. In addition, when casein-containing plates were used …

The vacuolar space and surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) are the interface between the parasite and the host cell. Establishment and maintenance of the vacuole and PVM are dependent on temporally regulated secretion from three different secretory organelles, the rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules. Understanding the process of secretion and the localization and function of secreted parasite proteins provides important insights into the pathogenesis of infections with T. gondii. For this reason, we have been studying the structure and function of the PVM and of secreted parasite proteins in the vacuolar space and membrane. Our initial results showed that the newly formed PVM is fusion incompetent, being incapable of fusing with any vesicular organelle of the host … 
David Bermudes|Isolation and Analysis of Suppressor Mutations in Tumor-Targeted msbB Salmonella|K Brooks Low, Sean R Murray, John Pawelek, David Bermudes|2016||||95-123|Humana Press, New York, NY|Tumor-targeted Salmonella offers a promising approach to the delivery of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The Salmonella strains used, however, must be stably attenuated in order to provide sufficient safety for administration. Approaches to the generation of attenuated Salmonella strains have included deletion of the msbB gene that is responsible for addition of the terminal myristol group to lipid A. In the absence of myristoylation, lipid A is no longer capable of inducing septic shock, resulting in a significant enhancement in safety. However, msbB Salmonella strains also exhibit an unusual set of additional physiological characteristics, including sensitivities to NaCl, EGTA, deoxycholate, polymyxin, and CO2. Suppressor mutations that compensate for these sensitivities include somA, Suwwan, pmrA C , and zwf. We describe here methods for isolation of strains with compensatory …

The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration. TAPET-CD accumulated in tumors at levels 1000-fold higher than that in normal tissues and high levels of 5-FU were detected in tumors in mice treated with both TAPET-CD and 5-FC. No 5-FU could be detected in normal tissues. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with either TAPET-CD alone or TAPET-CD in combination with 5-FC (TAPET-CD/5-FC), but not with 5-FC alone. TAPET-CD/5-FC inhibited tumor growth by 88%-96%, compared to TAPET-CD alone, which inhibited tumor growth by 38%-79%. These data suggest that tumor-targeting Salmonella could be used to deliver prodrug-converting enzyme selectively to tumors and produced anti-tumor effects when the corresponding prodrug was also given.

We initially constructed chimeras of SFTI with N-terminal secretion signals from the Escherichia coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ToxA, but only detected small amounts of protease inhibition resulting from these constructs. A substantially higher degree of protease inhibition was detected from a C-terminal SFTI fusion with E. coli YebF, which radiated more than a centimeter from an individual colony of E. coli using a culturebased inhibitor assay. Inhibitory activity was further improved in YebF-SFTI fusions by the addition of a trypsin cleavage signal immediately upstream of SFTI, and resulted in production of a 14-amino-acid, disulfide-bonded SFTI free in the culture supernatant. To assess the potential of the secreted SFTI to protect the ability of a cytotoxic protein to kill tumor cells, we utilized a tumor-selective form of the Pseudomonas ToxA (OTG-PE38K) alone and expressed as a polycistronic construct with YebF-SFTI in the tumor-targeted Salmonella VNP20009. When we assessed the ability of toxin-containing culture supernatants to kill MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, the untreated OTG-PE38K was able to eliminate all detectable tumor cells, while pretreatment with trypsin resulted in the complete loss of anticancer cytotoxicity. However, when OTG-PE38K was co-expressed with YebF-SFTI, cytotoxicity was completely retained in the presence of trypsin. These data demonstrate SFTI chimeras are secreted in a functional form and that co-expression of protease inhibitors with therapeutic proteins by tumor-targeted bacteria …

This drug ratio consistently displayed synergy in a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro whereas increasing or decreasing the drug ratio lead to decreased synergy and the appearance of antagonism based on median-effect analysis. CPX-1 has demonstrated markedly superior therapeutic activity over the free irinotecan:floxuridine drug cocktails in a range of preclinical solid tumor models and in vivo efficacy was also shown to be drug ratio dependent. Given the prevalent use of biological agents in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic CRC, we examined the effects of combining CPX-1 with BEV or CET in human CRC tumor xenografts with … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|David Bermudes, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, Sean R Murray, Verena Karsten, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy|2009|||||Biomed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high …

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer—speciﬁc molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anticancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer~ speciﬁc targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufﬁciently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce signiﬁcant therapeutic effects.

This selectivity occurred in subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, including Bl6FIO melanoma, M127 lung carcinoma, and colon 38 carcinoma. The preferential accumulation was also manifested in animals bearing human tumor xenografts, including Lox, C8186, DLDl. SW620, HCT l l6. HTB 177, DU145. MDA-MB-231, and Caki. Four to five days after a single IV injection of l x lO' colony-forming unit (cfu)/mouse, we routinely detected VNP20009 proliferation and accumulation at levels ranging from l x 10" to 2 x to'' cfu/g tumor. The amount of VNP20009 accumulated in the liver ranged from 3 x 10' to 2 x 10" cfu/g. The distribution of Salmonella in tumors was homogenous; YS72l2 cnuld he detected from the periphery to the interior portion of the tumors. Using mice with various immunodeficiencies. we also discoverd the same preferential accumulation of Salmonella in tumors implanted in these mice. The use of Salmonella as a protein delivery vector was shown by IV administration of the bacteria expressing either green f1uorescent protein (GFP) or cytosine deaminase (CD) into tumor-bearing mice. GFP and CD were detected in tumors, but not in livers, taken from mice inoculated with Salmonella carrying these genes. Bacteria accumulation and CD expression persisted in the tumors for up to 14 days after a single bolus IV administration of bacteria to tumor- bearing mice.

Controls included parental S91 melanoma cells, S91 S91 autologous hybrids, and highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells. Cells were implanted s.c. in the tail, and mice were monitored for metastases over 6 months. A striking characteristic of the hybrids was heterogeneity among individual cell lines, with metastases generated in mice ranging from 0- 100% of animals, and basal melanin content from amelanotic to supermelanotic. Heterogeneity was further augmented in vivo in that hybrids stably melanotic after repeated passage in culture occasionally produced amelanotic metastases in mice. With few exceptions, hybrids had elevated basal tyrosinase activity and were much more responsive to MSH compared to parental controls. The most aggressive hybrids were supermelanotic and also markedly more motile than parental cells in vitro. Autologous S91 S91 hybrids were even less metastatic and less motile than parental cells. Histologically, the metastatic hybrids demonstrated vascular invasion and spread to distant organs similar to that of metastatic melanomas in mice and humans. The hybrids resembled natural melanoma metastases so closely that they should serve as useful new models for this complex phenomenon.

In order to better understand this phenomenon, we carried out analyses of 30 separately isolated melanoma/macrophage hybrid lines, focusing on expression of differentiated functions characteristic of macrophages or melanocytes. Findings were as follows. 1) Hybrids contained DNA sequences from both parental lines. 2) Hybrids were supermelanotic and highly responsive to MSH compared to parental Cloudman cells. 3) Hybrids expressed fluoride-sensitive non-specific esterase activity characteristic of monocytes and macrophages. 4) EM studies revealed that the hybrids had melanosomes with organized lattice structures, reminscent of those in normal melanocytes, whereas melanosomes in the parental cells were typically amorphous. 5) Western blotting studies revealed that in many of the hybrids the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, as well as the LAMP-1 protein migrated more slowly on electrophoretic gels than the analagous proteins expressed by parental melanoma cells. Further, LAMP-1 in hybrids migrated at an identical rate to that of macrophage LAMP-1. These differences were consistent with differences in protein glycosylation, as if a macrophage-like protein glycosyltransferase were expressed in the hybrids. In summary, hybrids formed between Cloudman melanoma cells and normal macrophages form highly aggressive tumors in mice, are supermelanotic, have normal appearing … 
David Bermudes|Macrophage characteristics of metastatic melanoma.|John Pawelek, Michael Rachkovsky, Stefano Sodi, Jean Bolognia, Ashok Chakraborty, Jennifer Madison, David Bermudes|1995|Journal of Investigative Dermatology|4|104|605||Since first proposed by Aichel (1911), expression of lymphocytic/monocytic traits has often been suggested as a mechanism for metastasis. Abilities to invade basment membranes and to home to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and distant organs are characteristics shared by lymphocytes, monocytes, and metastatic cancer cells alike. Previous studies showed that in vitro hybridization between normal lymphocytes or monocytes and transformed lymphoid cell lines resulted in increased agressiveness of the hybrid cells in vivo. However, such experiments had not been carried out with cells of solid tumor origin. Accordingly, we isolated clones of hybrids between normal mouse macrophages from DBA/2J mice and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells, using standard cell fusion and HAT selection techniques. Five hybrid clones were examined for their metastatic potential compared to the S91 parental cell line. First, in a Matrigel @ invasion assay, macrophage x melanoma hybrids showed increased abilities to cross an artificial biomatrix compared to S91 parental cells. Further, biomatrix invasion was dramatically increased in the hybrid clones but not in the parental S91 cells following exposure to MSH and IBMX. Second, in two separate experiments parental S91 cells and 5 macrophage x melanoma hybrids were inoculated s.c. into the tails of 20 DBA/2J mice. Mice inoculated with parental S91 cells did not die during the experiment and showed little or no evidence of metastases over 5 months. In contrast, mice inoculated with hybrids began dying of soft tissue and pulmonary metastases within 4-6 weeks (>30% of mice). Histologic sections …

David Bermudes|Microbial contributions to the Precambrian Earth|L Margulis, D Bermudes, R Obar|1986/5/1||||||Life has existed on Earth for approximately 3.5 billion years. For most of this time, prokaryotic communities provided the major biological forces changing the Earth. Many changes in atmospheric gas composition occurred during the Archean and Proterozoic eons as a result of microbial activity. Extant microbial communities were used to help understand the dynamics which contributed to these atmospheric changes. The microbial mat communities were characterized according to the organismic constituents. Symbiosis in microbial communities is recognized as a major force in cell evolution. Among the evolutinary enigmas investigated is the problem of the origin of the undulipodia. Undulipodial microtubules are still deployed for major cellular processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Several prokaryotes were tested for the presence of the S1-type protein, so far only spirochetes were found to possess it. The S1-type protein is being sought in cyanobacteria reported to contain microtubules.

Microbial processes of primary production and initial degradation at the most active zone of the microbial mat were analyzed. 
David Bermudes|Glutathione in cyanobacteria|David Bermudes|1985/7/1||||||The effects of light and O2 on glutathione production were determined. Results of light and dark studies under normal and reduced oxygen tensions were compared to determine the effect of reduction in oxygen tension on glutathione levels. The growth rate of Anacystis nidulans and concurrent production of glutathione is presented. The generation of time of Anacystis nidulans was approximately 12 hours. Results of light and dark incubation of Aphanothece halophytica dominated planktonic microbial community from Pond 4 and Anacystis nidulans under high and low oxygen tension is also presented. It appears that light grown Anacystis nidulans cells have equal amounts of glutathione while dark grown cells produce more glutathione in the presence of increased O2. 
David Bermudes|Planetary biology internship program|David Bermudes|1985/3/1|Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|16|1|93-93|Springer Netherlands|Earth is the last planet in our solar system to be studied as a planet. Since their origins, these bodies have undergone major surface and atmospheric changes. Unlike the changes on Mars and Venus, many of the surface changes on Earth are due to the effects of life. Not only are atmospheric gases such as O 2 and CH 4 biological products (from photosynthesis and methanogenesis, respectively), but many other atmospheric constituents are biogenic. The understanding of how Earth gave rise to life, how life has changed the planet, and the role that life plays in maintaining the present conditions on Earth as a whole are the concerns of Planetary Biology. The integrated study of Earth and its history as a planet involves not only space exploration and remote sensing techniques by satellite and airplane but also direct study of the origin~ and fossil record of life. Furthermore, an integrated understanding of our planet involves, among other … 
David Bermudes|Abstract C114|PG Tardi, TO Harasym, SA Johnstone, N Zisman, LD Mayer, D Bermudes|||||||CONCLUSIONS In vitro screening of irinotecan and cisplatin for median-effect combination indices (CI; Chou and Talalay 1984, Adv. Enzyme Reg. 22: 27-55) based on molar drug ratios. CI screening a human tumor cell line panel results in a fixed-ratio matrix “heat map” shown for drug concentrations resulting in an 80% fraction of cells affected (ED= 80). Green (CI< 1), synergy; yellow (CI~ 1), additivity; red (CI> 1), antagonism. Plasma levels of irinotecan and cisplatin were determined at five time points after iv administration in female CD-1 nude mice. A. Following injection of CPX-571 at an irinotecan dose of 60 μmoles/kg (41 mg/kg) and a cisplatin dose of 8.6 μmoles/kg (2.6 mg/kg), mouse plasma was isolated at the indicated times and assayed for irinotecan (●) and cisplatin (○) by HPLC. B. Based on the plasma drug levels, the molar ratio of irinotecan: cisplatin was calculated for each time point. All data points represent the mean values obtained from three mice per time point, and the error bars represent the SE.
