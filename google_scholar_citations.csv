Hilary Silvia-Goldberg||It's a Nuisance: The Future of Fracking Litigation in the Wake of Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.||Hydraulic fracturing, or" fracking," is a polarizing topic, having earned both staunch advocates who see its possibilities for the domestic production of energy and ardent opponents who anticipate dire consequences resulting from its environmental impact. The practice has resulted in over one hundred lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, none of which have gone to verdict prior to the recent jury decision in Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc. 1 Because its result did not rest on a conclusion that the practice of fracking itself constituted a compensable wrong, Parr neither vindicated the oil and gas industry by exonerating it nor validated critics of fracking. Instead, the decision, based on a single cause of action of intentional private nuisance, demonstrated that juries were willing to find in favor of private plaintiffs even without a showing that fracking itself resulted in direct harm to the lives and property of those living nearby. The jury … ||Va. Envtl. LJ|2015|Hilary M Goldberg, Melanie Stallings Williams, Deborah Cours||||33|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WuTNQ1sAAAAJ
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg||On Parr: The Use and Propriety of Appraisal Methods in Computing Fracking Awards||Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.,'made headlines in 2014 for being the first hydraulic fracturing (" Tracking") case to result in a jury verdict. In Parr, a Texas jury awarded $2.925 million to compensate the Parr family for injuries sustained resulting from Aruba Petroleum's nearby fracking activities. Of the nearly $3 million Parr verdict, later reversed on other grounds, the jury awarded $275,000 for diminution in property value. 2 Thanks to the fiercely litigated and highly publicized trial and appeal, scholars, practitioners and academics received a rare glimpse into an area of litigation otherwise insulated from public view by out of court resolutions and confidential settlement agreements. 3 In this interdisciplinary paper, we will provide an overview of the valuation process, addressing issues specific to diminution in value in the context of fracking and similar incidences of environmental contamination.

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg||Disclosing the Inevitable: Reconciling the Varied Requirements for the Disclosure of Death on Real Property||Whether or not a property owner is required to disclose to prospective purchasers a death, felony, or other traumatic event on her real property depends, almost entirely, upon where the property is located. Indeed, while many fundamental aspects of Real Estate Law are consistent nationwide, the requirements imposed upon sellers to disclose a death or other psychological element affecting the property vary by state. The proliferation and success of websites, such as DiedInHouse. com, which, for a fee, will provide a report of all deaths that occurred on a particular property, suggest that consumers nationwide want to know whether there has been a death on the property. Countless stories of perpetually vacant homes following notable deaths and violent crimes reinforce this notion. Is there any way to reconcile the competing interests of the buyer who is sensitive to the stigma and the seller facing potential diminution … ||Notre Dame JL Ethics & Pub.

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg||Stealing Time: The Propriety of Alleging Common Law Conversion in Modern Wage Theft Lawsuits||The words “wage theft” frequently make headlines when workers sue employers for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. Wage theft is “the illegal refusal by an employer to pay a worker the wages and benefits that he or she has legally earned.” In the United States, employer violation of wage and hour laws is a vast and enduring problem affecting as many as two-thirds of workers. In an attempt to combat this epidemic threat to hourly workers’ bottom lines, legislatures have fashioned numerous laws, some even invoking the power of “wage theft” terminology, such as New York’s Wage Theft Prevention Act. However, despite the pervasive usage of the term “wage theft” by the media, politicians, and pundits, a search of the term “wage theft” in legal libraries yields little precedent. This begs the question: can employers be liable for conversion for failing to compensate employees for time-spent working? The efficacy of conversion claims in wage-related lawsuits remains an unsettled question. However, if as a society, we are sounding the alarm in every incidence of possible wage and hour law violations, we ultimately misinform the population of potential plaintiffs regarding the viability of a claim for theft, or conversion, of earned yet unpaid wages. |||2017|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg, Paul Silvia|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WuTNQ1sAAAAJ

The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires that employers pay employees, including temporary employees, for all “hours worked,” so the question is what constitutes hours worked for the temporary worker? The answer generally comes down to “time spent under the employer’s control” but what does that mean?

We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good' and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the … ||British journal of sociology of education|2012/3/1|Sarah S Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|Routledge|||33|2||283-301||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

We examine the policy rationales for the recruitment of international students to England. Through the use of in‐depth interviews with key role players at four English universities, we compare the rhetoric, rationales and reasons for the recruitment of international students. A range of discourses can be identified in the recruitment of international students and an economic competition rationale is dominant. This is expressed within the discourse of globalisation. ||Globalisation, Societies and Education|2008/3/1|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|Routledge|||6|1||75-88||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||Rationales, rhetoric and realities: FIFA’s World Cup in South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014||The 2010 FIFA World Cup was heralded by mainstream media outlets, the local organisers, the South African government and FIFA as an unequivocal success. The month-long spectacle saw South Africa take centre stage and host the world’s largest single sporting event. This occurred against a backdrop of rationales and promises made that the event would leave lasting legacies for all, in particular marginalised South Africans. The reality is quite different. In this article we consider the South African World Cup in the build up to Brazil 2014. We argue that the rationales and rhetoric are similar in both countries and suggest the reality for Brazil 2014 will be the same as South Africa 2010 in that the mega-event will be primarily funded by significant public investment, while the primary beneficiaries will be private capital and FIFA. ||International Review for the Sociology of Sport|2015/5|Bárbara Schausteck de Almeida, Chris Bolsmann, Wanderley Marchi Junior, Juliano de Souza|SAGE Publications|||50|3||265-282||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

Chris Bolsmann ||Soccer, South Africa and celebrity status: Mark Fish, popular culture and the post‐apartheid state||The rise of celebrity culture is a theme that has attracted a significant amount of attention within both mainstream sociology and cultural studies in more recent times. Ensuing debate has identified contemporary sports figures as an important facet of the celebrity‐media nexus and as possible signifiers of cultural change. In this paper we take one particular sports celebrity, South African soccer star Mark Fish, and evaluate his image in relation to debates surrounding sport, politics and the post‐apartheid state. We argue that because Fish appears to enjoy all the benefits of celebrity status (within his home country at least), an analysis of his career and identity provide a useful means by which to think about the changing political and nationalistic values within South African society. ||Soccer & Society|2007/1/1|Chris Bolsmann, Andrew Parker|Routledge|||8|1||109-124||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||White football in South Africa: Empire, apartheid and change, 1892–1977||This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more significant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth‐century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the first period under consideration (1892–1940s), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of … ||Soccer & Society|2010/1/1|Chris Bolsmann|Routledge|||11|1-2||29-45||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||Africa's World Cup: critical reflections on play, patriotism, spectatorship, and space||Africa’s World Cup: Critical Reflections on Play, Patriotism, Spectatorship, and Spacefocuses on a remarkable month in the modern history of Africa and in the global history of football. Peter Alegi and Chris Bolsmann are well-known experts on South African football, and they have assembled an impressive team of local and international journalists, academics, and football experts to reflect on the 2010 World Cup and its broader significance, its meanings, complexities, and contradictions. The World Cup’s sounds, sights, and aesthetics are explored, along with questions of patriotism, nationalism, and spectatorship in Africa and around the world. Experts on urban design and communities write on how the presence of the World Cup worked to refashion urban spaces and negotiate the local struggles in the hosting cities. The volume is richly illustrated by authors’ photographs, and the essays in this volume feature chronicles of match day experiences; travelogues; ethnographies of fan cultures; analyses of print, broadcast, and electronic media coverage of the tournament; reflections on the World Cup’s private and public spaces; football exhibits in South African museums; and critiques of the World Cup’s processes of inclusion and exclusion, as well as its political and economic legacies. The volume concludes with a forum on the World Cup, including Thabo Dladla, Director of Soccer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Mohlomi Kekeletso Maubane, a well-known Soweto-based writer and a soccer researcher, and Rodney Reiners, former professional footballer and current chief soccer writer for the Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town.

The team comprised 16 black South Africans who played under the auspices of the whites-only Orange Free State Football Association and was the first ever South African football team to tour abroad. In a four-month tour the team played 49 matches against opposition in England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. A small but growing body of work focuses on black sport and football in particular and the 1899 tour is referred to in passing in a few publications, although none have attempted to uncover details of the team or the matches that were played in Europe.

Chris Bolsmann ||Pre-empting the challenges of transformation and marketisation of higher education: a case study of the Rand Afrikaans University||With the advent of the marketisation of higher education and the change to a democratic dispensation, South African universities find themselves facing budgetary constraints that need to be reconciled with the transformation of previous bastions of elitism into institutions accommodating and representing all South Africans. The Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) was founded in 1967 to provide Christian National education for white working-class Afrikaans-speaking students and its first vice-chancellor was a leading member of the Broederbond. Although this ethos tended to dominate university policy and practices until fairly recently, the university has at the same time been involved in innovations with regard to teaching since its inception. This paper focuses on recent changes that have taken place at RAU.

Chris Bolsmann ||South Africa and the global game: Introduction||On 10 May 1994, the festivities for Nelson Mandela’s presidential inauguration included a soccer match between South Africa and Zambia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. At halftime, Mandela’s helicopter landed on the pitch. As the president stepped out onto the grass, the huge crowd erupted in a thunderous roar. When play resumed, the South Africans seemed electrified and went on to win the match 2-1. On 15 May 2004 in Zurich, Switzerland, Mandela wept with joy when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) awarded South Africa the right to host the 2010 World Cup. South Africans celebrated in the streets as if they had not simply won hosting rights, but the World Cup itself!‘To some extent this outburst of euphoria surpassed 1994’, commented Ahmed Kathrada, the former political prisoner incarcerated with Mandela for 26 years;‘The scenes of jubilation, the spontaneous outpouring of … ||Soccer & Society|2010/1/1|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|Routledge|||11|1-2||1-11||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

We draw on in-depth interviews, archival materials and a range of press coverage. We argue that three broad overlapping themes are apparent in both case studies. These are the developmental rhetoric both hosts employ in the justification of holding the events in their respective countries. Mexico and South Africa convey a leadership role that stretches across the South American and African continent respectively. Finally, both countries argue that the legacy the respective tournament leaves is important. ||Sport in Society|2009/12/1|Chris Bolsmann, Keith Brewster|Taylor & Francis Group|||12|10||1284-1298||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||South African football tours at the turn of the twentieth century: Amateurs, pioneers and profits||Academic and popular studies of South African sport generally reveal a bias towards cricket and rugby and this perpetuates the myth that these games are the most popular in South Africa. This in turn is often viewed through the lens of ‘race’ in which the simplifications of sport along racial lines occur. This paper argues that football was more important in South Africa among all South Africans in the late 19th and early 20th century than has been previously acknowledged. It reveals that not only was the game important and popular in South Africa but its teams and administrators played a significant role in globalising the game during this period. Tours to and from South Africa were important politically, financially and for sporting reasons. Five ground breaking football tours took place during a ten year period and these serve as the basis of discussion in this paper. ||African Historical Review|2010/6/1|Chris Bolsmann|Taylor & Francis Group|||42|1||91-112||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||From Apartheid to unity: White capital and black power in the racial integration of South African football, 1976–1992||This article analyses the complex process that deracialised and democratised South African football between the early 1970s and 1990s. Based mainly on archival documents, it argues that growing isolation from world sport, exemplified by South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic movement in 1970 and FIFA in 1976, and the reinvigoration of the liberation struggle with the Soweto youth uprising triggered a process of gradual desegregation in the South African professional game. While Pretoria viewed such changes as a potential bulwark against rising black militancy, white football and big business had their own reasons for eventually supporting racial integration, as seen in the founding of the National Soccer League. As negotiations for a new democratic South Africa began in earnest between the African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP) in the latter half of the 1980s, transformations … ||African Historical Review|2010/6/1|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|Taylor & Francis Group|||42|1||1-18||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

In addition, the NFL imported a range of international players, invited foreign teams and actively engaged in the political debates in South African sport at the time. The NFL was instrumental in popularising the game across the country for all South Africans. The NFL became the most popular sports entertainment of choice for South Africans during this period.

In large measure, South Africa’s preparations for hosting the 2010 World Cup presented similar hurdles to those confronted by Mexico 40 years earlier. What I believe this comparative approach reveals is that the two countries not only shared common experiences as a result of having to stage mega-sports-events, but that their experiences show similarities explicitly because they were viewed as somehow falling short of expectations set by the ‘Western world’. Additionally, as we shall see, the rare opportunity afforded the two states in hosting these events fostered a fundamental debate within each country concerning projection of itself and its role in the … ||Bulletin of Latin American Research|2010/3|Chris Bolsmann|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|||29|||93-106||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

This examination of the impact of globalisation on the restructuring of public sector universities in South Africa in the 1990s demonstrates that the picture is far more complex. Over the last thirty years, globalisation has been intertwined with neoliberal capitalist economic and ideological restructuring. This is refracted, in the first instance, through State policy, and, in the second, through specific local sites of power relations and class struggles that are, in turn, structured by the resources and responses of different actors. While the neoliberal component of globalisation has played a decisive role in shaping State higher education policy in South Africa, the actual implementation of the model of the market-orientated university receiving minimal support from a deficit conscious State has … ||Society in Transition|2003/7/1|Lucien van der Walt, Chris Bolsmann, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|Taylor & Francis Group|||34|2||272-294||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

The ensuing relationship resulted in trade union internationalism and solidarity with South African workers in their struggle against apartheid. After the insertion of the South African plant into the global production networks of the company, a range of new pressures and challenges confronted the union in South Africa. This resulted in the mass dismissal in 2000. In an attempt to garner international support and solidarity, the dismissed workers tapped into existing structures with no success, illustrating the reconfiguration of trade union internationalism away from worker interests to those of the unions and company. ||Labor Studies Journal|2010/12|Chris Bolsmann|SAGE Publications|||35|4||520-539||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

Chris Bolsmann ||The Outsourced University||The “transformation” of the public sector universities in post-apartheid South Africa remains at the centre of government’s political commitments, policy formation processes, and public debate. 1 Yet one aspect of university restructuring has received surprisingly little attention: the trend towards the outsourcing of support service functions in the 1990s. Although the conflicts arising from this process caught the public eye on a number of occasions, most notably the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the support services at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2000, there has been no thorough study of the rise and effects of support service outsourcing in South Africa. The few studies that exist tend to be brief, sometimes journalistic, and generally confined to an examination of a single institution. By comparison, issues such as curriculum restructuring, university governance,“marketisation” and the proposed mergers and disestablishment of a number of institutions have been the subject of a great deal of public analysis, not to mention political conflict. 2 This paper provides an overview of the process of support service outsourcing across the public sector universities, and examines the effects of this process on workers and their trade unions. Our focus is on the period 1994 to 2001. By support services, we refer, in particular, to those manual and menial campus occupations that do not contribute directly towards knowledge production but which are, nonetheless, essential to the functioning of the universities. These occupations include catering, cleaning, grounds and building maintenance, security services and transport. The paper situates this … |||1994|Lucien Van der Walt, C Bolsman, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|A survey of the rise of support service outsourcing in public sector higher education in South African and its effects on workers and trade unions|||2001|||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||Taking South African sport seriously||Twenty years on, the image of Nelson Mandela, wearing the number six jersey of the white Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar, remains a poignant moment in South African and global sport. The 1995 Rugby World Cup victory by the overwhelmingly all-white Springboks remains a powerful symbol in post-apartheid South Africa. Clint Eastwood’s (2009) Hollywood film, Invictus, based on John Carlin’s Playing the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that made a nation (2008), has dramatised the significance of Mandela wearing the jersey and the South African victory. The formerly exclusive symbol was seemingly appropriated and made socially inclusive and became part of the lexicon and rhetoric of nation building post-1994. For Ashwin Desai (2010: 1), rugby had become ‘the sport that would help to catalyse the building of a “rainbow nation” predicated on a common identity, a common sense of “South … |||2015/1/2|Chris Bolsmann, Cora Burnett|Routledge|||46|1||1-6||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

Therefore, the 2010 edition of this event is used as analytical approach to reveal some of the rhetoric and strategic actions that permeated the context of its realization. Based on data obtained in the academic literature and media, we present that the motivations for the event were based on developmental discourses by both FIFA as well as local elites South African aiming to convince different social groups and conquer their support. However, the consequences are not necessarily those promised, and these institutions were the real benefciaries in their economic and political mutual interests.

Chris Bolsmann ||Solidarity and Identity: Volkswagen Workers in South Africa and Germany||THE FOCUS OF this chapter is on worker identity within a trans-national corporation (TNC). This is related to international trade union solidarity, within Volkswagen AG'(VWAG). The connections between identity and solidarity are complex and the two ideas cannot be regarded as synonymous; rather they influence each other during two different periods under consideration. The chapter traces the 20 year relationship and solidarity displayed between the two trade unions organising in Germany and South Africa respectively, namely IG MetalP and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA). The first contact was initiated in the late 1970s and the ensuing links have developed over the last two decades. The central claim of this chapter is that two broad overlapping periods of interaction can be identified. The nature of these relations affects the forms of solidarity displayed by participants and the manner in which they relate to and interact with one another in terms of trade union internationalism. In the first section of this chapter, the analytical framework for understanding solidarity is explored. Solidarity is understood as action that benefits Volkswagen of South Africa (VWSA) employees and trade unionists and broader activity against the apartheid state. This is interpreted against the backdrop of a specific form of trade union internationalism during apartheid. In the second section, specific themes related to the above periods which emerged from semi structured in- ||Globalisation and new identities: A view from the middle|2006|Chris Bolsmann|Jacana Media||||||137-55||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ
Chris Bolsmann ||White football in South Africa: empire, apartheid and change, 1892—1977||This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more signiﬁcant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth-century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the ﬁrst period under consideration (1892—19405), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of professionalism and antiapartheid organizations. In the ﬁnal phase (1967—77), ofﬁcials experimented with football on ‘multi-national’and multi-racial lines—a failed reform that led to the demise of white football.

Chris Bolsmann ||Review Essay on Peter Alegi, Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa||With the readmission of South African football into the international fold in 1992, a new phase began in the nation’s sporting history. In football, the euphoria continued with the national team winning the 1996 African Cup of Nations and participating in two World Cups in France in 1998 and Japan and South Korea in 2002. In addition to staging the 1996 African Cup of Nations, the most important football competition, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the country in 2010. Despite the abovementioned successes, relatively few studies have focussed on South African football. Mark Gleeson, South Africa’s foremost football writer and commentator, notes in his forward to the book Laduma!

Chris Bolsmann ||Globalisation and the Outsourced University in South Africa||The “transformation” of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has been a key focus of the new government’s reformist policy initiatives. On the one hand, the government has sought to break down racialised divisions in the sector between Historically Advantaged Institutions (HAIs) and Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs), to make the staff and student bodies more “representative” of the country as a whole, and to make the universities more accountable to its national and developmental priorities. On the other hand, government’s initiatives have taken place within the dual constraints of its own conservative macro-economic policy model, embodied in the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (GEAR), and the broader challenges imposed by neo-liberal globalisation. Within this context, the transformation of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has not proceeded in a smooth or monolithic manner. Rather, there have been many transformations, with different winners and losers, in the sector over the past decade, transformations shaped by the new global ideology of university “marketisation,” by the fiscal constraints of government’s macro-economic policy, by continued divisions between HAIs ands HDIs, and by divisions within universities by race and class and occupation. In this research paper, we examine one of these transformations: the restructuring and outsourcing of university support service functions in the 1990s. Even if some of the conflicts that have arisen from this process have caught the public eye-notably during the controversial restructuring of support services at the University of the … ||Final Report for CHET.

Consequently, before the 2010 World Cup, South Africa still remained a closed book to many.

Yet while the claim to originality was a tacit acknowledgment that the city had a footballing past, rarely has this past been explored in the relevant historiography. Thus, the founding of LAFC presents a timely moment to fill in the scholarly gap. This article uses LAFC as an entry point for exploring the contours of professional soccer in Los Angeles over the previous half-century.

It helped, of course, that soccer was ‘a game of the elite’in the countries that the Corinthians visited. 2 Sports tourism could be an especially congenial experience when the hosts were attentive, flattering and shared a common social background with their guests.

Moreover, when he withdrew from active involvement in the club’s affairs in 1898, the founder could be confident that his legacy was in safe hands.

In this article, we consider association football tours between both countries from 1914 to 1955 against the backdrop of increased racism and segregation in South Africa and the anti-colonial movement in India. We draw from a range of sources, including archives, unpublished reports and newspaper articles. The sports tours helped to solidify relations between Indians in South Africa and India underpinning political, cultural, spiritual and emotional ties; they show how Indianness was forged among diasporans and that this was highly contested and constantly transformed in relation to external conditions; and they expose the racism on the part of white sporting organisations in particular and white politicians in general in South Africa. ||Journal of Southern African Studies|2017/11/2|Chris Bolsmann, Goolam Vahed|Routledge|||43|6||1273-1291||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

At times, emulating the sports pages of the era, Martin’s writing is a bit hyperbolic, but overall, he provides a straight-forward story of an individual worthy of recognition. davies was a top scorer with his drives and two-handed set shot, but he was an even better passer and team leader. He began in a slow-down era but adjusted well to the fast-break ball that followed the inception of the twenty-four-second clock in the NBA in 1954–55; many opponents and coaches noted that this latter type of ball would have been perfect for davies to star.

Chris Bolsmann ||‘They are able to play football in South Africa’: Austria’s ‘little Wunderteam’on tour in 1936||From the end of the nineteenth century South Africa had become a popular touring destination for British and colonial sports teams. Tours in the popular sport of cricket, football and rugby were very popular. These tours tested local opposition against foreign competition, brought in revenue to local and national sports associations and contributed to the development of a white South African identity. Austrian football teams were extensive travellers and popular attractions around the world. Prior to the Second World War Austrian football was highly regarded and was able to compete and hold its own against English and Scottish clubs and representative teams. This article considers an unusual tour by a combined Viennese football team to South Africa in 1936. We consider the preparations for the tour, the different playing styles and the way in which the visitors were received around the country.

Chris Bolsmann ||University rankings and the consolidation of elite networked institutions in an era of global capital||In this paper we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good’ and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the elite networked institutions of global capital. We conclude by arguing that, rather than regarding world university rankings as a means to establish criteria of educational value, the practice may be understood as an exclusionary one that furthers the alignment of higher education with neoliberal rationalities at both national and global levels. exclusion; higher education; knowledge society; neoliberalism; transnational capitalist class; university rankings |||2015/9/12|Sarah Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cFKNjHMAAAAJ

This paper interprets the way in which South African football was formalized and structured around the political and industrial networks of the British Empire during the Victorian era. At the end of the 19th century, five years even before FIFA was officially founded, African teams were the first to go overseas to play in Europe and South America.

Magill recommended basing decisions on Naylor and Briggs' hypothesis of task complexity and organization, while Schmidt and Wrisberg recommended basing decisions on skill classification. To evaluate the accuracy of these recommendations, a meta-analysis was conducted. Through a literature search, 44 articles were located, and 20 provided sufficient information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were calculated using means for whole and part practice for acquisition and retention. Although several analyses were compromised by insufficient studies investigating whole and part practice, mean effect sizes generally supported motor learning textbooks. To better verify the empirical validity of recommendations for the use of whole and part practice, more studies are necessary. ||Perceptual and motor skills|2009/10|Fabio E Fontana, Oldemar Mazzardo, Ovande Furtado Jr, Jere D Gallagher|Ammons Scientific, Ltd.|||109|2||517-530||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=k_S9WIoAAAAJ

In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51–.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged.

Children who master a number of fundamental movement skills are more likely to be physically active and they also may be more likely to take part in physical activity when being compared to peers with a lesser level of motor skill proficiency. Children who are considered overweight tend to engage less often in physical activities, which in turn may prevents them from acquiring fundamental movements skills. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and fundamental movement skills in children ages 5 to 7 in a rural school system.

NASPE standards reflect what students should know and be able to do as a result of a quality physical education (NASPE, 2004). This link is even more beneficial to students and teachers alike when assessment is aligned with the NASPE content standards. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a criterion-referenced assessment tool to test movement concepts and fundamental movement skills of children ages 3 through 10 and provide evidence for content-related validity. An attempt was made to develop an assessment tool that is tied closely to the postulates of the National Standards for Physical Education (NASPE, 2004). The gathering of evidence for content-related validity was accomplished through judgments of a panel of 20 content experts (professors = 8; and PE teachers = 12). An Internet-based item review form was used to collect information from experts. Experts rated content at item level (31 items divided in 7 categories) using a four point likert-type scale where 1 being 'not important at all' and 4 'very important'.

METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls. ||Pensar a Prática|2018/3/29|Oldemar Mazzardo, Fábio Eduardo Fontana, Ovande Furtado, Jere D Gallagher||||21|1||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=k_S9WIoAAAAJ

An expert in motor behavior classified the videotapes using the newly created rating scales. Next, 8 video clips were selected for training purposes and 24 video clips for testing purposes. In Phase II, 30 undergraduate and graduate students served as raters and underwent a training session prior the testing session. Participants were instructed not to classify the video clips based on the apparent age of the children as skill levels were distributed across all age levels. Further, to avoid guessing, participants were not told how many videos of each level they would be rating. Unlike the training sessions, participants did not receive feedback during testing sessions. Weighted kappa (Kw) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were used to analyze data. Results suggested a “very good” agreement between expert and rater consensus for vertical jumping (Kw = .96) and galloping (Kw=.89) and an “excellent” agreement for vertical jump (ICC = .98) and galloping (ICC = .95). Inter-rater reliability resulted in “very good” agreement for vertical jumping (Kw=.92) and a “good … |||2018|Lino Perez|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=k_S9WIoAAAAJ

Messner, and Robin Hextrum 2013). Scholars have attributed this drought to decision making: national surveys indicate that industry leaders in sports media operate under the assumption that their readers, viewers, and listeners are not interested in women’s sports (Marie Hardin 2005; Marie Hardin, Dunja Antunovic, Steve Bien-Aimé, and Roubing Li 2013). To challenge this assumption, in November 2013, the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota launched a social media initiative titled the# HERESPROOF Project.

Andrew Linden ||From Ladies' Days to Women's Initiatives: American Pastimes and Distaff Consumption||American entrepreneurs have, for more than a century, sought to cultivate female consumers of national pastimes, specifically horse racing, boxing, baseball, football and basketball. Because these sports have been principally and historically associated with manliness and masculinity, it is more appropriate to think in terms of women's involvement and consumption, as opposed to their athletic participation when it comes to ‘pastime' status. Marketing campaigns aimed at women by the promoters of national pastimes reveal complex processes of commercialisation, bourgeoisification and hypercommodification. The ways in which major sports leagues and administrators appealed to women have long been based on essentialised feminine roles, treating women as moralising agents, wives and mothers, and consumers. These strategies represent the primary force in shaping women's inclusion in national pastimes.

Andrew Linden ||Revolution on the American Gridiron: Gender, contested space, and women’s football in the 1970s||Scholarship on the 1970s ‘women’s movement’ in the USA has grown in recent years. However, this area has yet to fully incorporate women’s athletic experiences. This paper brings together these two areas of scholarship through analysis of women’s experiences playing professional football in 1970s America. Women athletes articulated little connection between football and the larger feminist campaign for corporeal autonomy and equality and some pronounced a distinctly antifeminist identity. My intent is not to force the feminist mantle on these women or to contest their self-descriptions. Rather, I seek to locate their experiences within the larger women’s movement using historian Anne Enke’s idea of ‘contested space’ (Finding the Movement, 2007). Drawing on interviews with 13 women on three different teams during the 1970s, I argue that while women football players did not explicitly align with the feminist … ||The International Journal of the History of Sport|2015/12/12|Andrew D Linden|Routledge|||32|18||2171-2189||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=og40OCIAAAAJ
Andrew Linden ||Tempering the Dichotomous Flame: Social History, Cultural History, and Postmodernism(s) in the Journal of Sport History, 1974–2014||In the June 2014 issue of the Journal of American History, which includes a forum titled “State of the Field: Sports in American History,” Amy Bass argues that, as many humanities-based disciplines adopted tenets of cultural history, sport history did not. Based on over a decade of debate about social, cultural, and postmodernist paradigms, Bass's assertion illuminates continuing historiographical arguments about epistemology and theory in sport history. In this article, I respond to these discussions by analyzing 405 full-length articles in the Journal of Sport History from the first issue in 1974 through the end of 2014. Drawing on philosopher R. Scott Kretchmar's caution against “dualisms [and] dichotomies” in sport scholarship, I argue for a holistic understanding of sport history, rather than the dichotomous historiography present over the past decade. ||Journal of Sport History|2016/4/1|Andrew D Linden|University of Illinois Press|||43|1||66-82||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=og40OCIAAAAJ

Despite the growing scientific understanding of the problem, however, heat-related deaths persist, often surging at different points in history.

After 4 months of civic activism from Cleveland's community and legal action from the city's politicians, Cleveland, the NFL and Modell agreed to a deal that allowed the long-time owner to honour his contract with Baltimore and simultaneously provided a NFL club to Cleveland to begin play in 1999. This settlement was unique because it allowed Cleveland to retain the naming rights, colours, logo and, most significantly, the history of the Browns. Media presentations of Modell's announcement during the 4-month period illuminated a complex symbiotic relationship between the press, the public and sports entrepreneurs.

This paper uses a content analysis of six sport-specific online forums to examine the composition of contributors and the content of posts, as well as the pitfalls and potential of academic sport blogging.

Andrew Linden ||Blue-Collar Identity and the" Culture of Losing": Cleveland and the" Save Our Browns" Campaign||In November 1995, Cleveland football fans began the "Save Our Browns" campaign after owner Art Modell announced he would move the team to Baltimore after the season. By February 1996, the initiative influenced the National Football League's decision to allow Cleveland to keep the legacy of the Browns and offer the city a new team. Letters found at the Pro Football Hall of Fame show how the Save Our Browns campaign illuminated a "culture of losing"–the combination of a declining city, poor sports teams, and angst from social change–in the greater Cleveland community. I argue that Clevelanders' fight for the Browns represented their desire for a Cleveland of the past that included an idealized blue-collar identity consisting of expressions of heteronormative, white masculinity.

Andrew Linden ||Political Football: Social Movements and the Professional Gridiron in the United States, 1955-1979||Politics and political movements appeared in professional football since the sport emerged. However, because the National Football League (NFL) was not yet popular across the country, these issues had little effect on the broader culture. In the second half of the century, the NFL became the most popular consumer sport in the country. Conflicts between labor and capital, between men and women, between races and ethnicities, and between groups associated with the broader counterculture and liberation movements were brought by political advocates into the sport. Nonetheless, throughout this same time, the league had political priorities of its own and endorsed certain political issues while not engaging others. In this dissertation, I utilize a “multiple histories” approach to analyze the effect of social movements on the NFL and demonstrate the influence of political football in American culture. To do so, I examine how four social movements (Civil Rights, the New Left and counterculture, labor, and the women’s movement) intersected with professional football from the late 1950s through the 1970s. League representatives had varying reactions each time a social movement appeared on the gridiron. For example, some team owners and coaches supported black athletes fighting to desegregate the game and other areas of society through non-violent protest, but they reacted to the broader Civil Rights Movement by reaffirming notions of white supremacy.

According to David M. Carter, the convergence of sports and entertainment “has been relatively contained” and primarily occurred “in and around sports venues”(p. 1). Today, this convergence is “borderless” and “pervasive,” and it “continues to create business challenges while simultaneously providing significant opportunities for those hoping to make money from it”(p. 1). In essence, Carter claims that sports have become synonymous with entertainment. For example, his analysis of the burgeoning “poker boom”(p. 150) astutely reifies the notion that there is a hazy demarcation point between sports and entertainment. Carter thus focuses on stakeholders, who have monetized the convergence, and offers recommendations for future entrepreneurs about ways in which to profit from the burgeoning industry.

Indubitavelmente, um dos exercícios mais utilizados no treinamento de força, visando o desenvolvimento da musculatura superior do tronco é o supino. O entendimento das diversas variações do exercício supino pode influenciar na correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar diversos aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício supino, além de suas possíveis variações como as inclinações do banco, o afastamento da empunhadura, a amplitude de movimento, as diferenças entre o exercício supino guiado e não guiado e as diferenças entre o supino em base estável e instável.

Paulo Marchetti ||Propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a biomechanical study||Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF … ||PloS one|2014/5/15|Andre Serra Bley, Joao Carlos Ferrari Correa, Amir Curcio Dos Reis, Nayra Deise Dos Anjos Rabelo, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucareli|Public Library of Science|||9|5||e97606||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AisC4tDSrTZIC%26tzom%3D420

The maximal voluntary isometric contraction test was repeated after 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 24 hours for both the quadriceps femoris and middle deltoid. Surface electromyography was recorded throughout the endurance test. RESULTS: Maximal voluntary isometric contraction significantly decreased only for the middle deltoid between … ||Respiratory care|2014/1/1|Eduardo Foschini Miranda, Carla Malaguti, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Simone Dal Corso|Respiratory Care|||59|1||62-69||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AhFOr9nPyWt4C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Muscle strength, postural balance, and cognition are associated with braking time during driving in older adults||Background Despite the well-known declines in driving performance with advancing age, there is little understanding of the specific factors that predict changes in key determinants such as braking time. Objectives The aims of this study were to determine the extent to which age, muscle strength, cognition and postural balance are associated with braking performance in middle-aged and older adults. Methods Male and female middle-aged adults (n = 62, age = 39.3 ± 7.1 years) and older adults (n = 102, age = 70.4 ± 5.8 years) were evaluated for braking performance, as well as in several motor and cognitive performance tasks. The motor evaluation included isokinetic ankle plantar flexor muscle strength, handgrip strength, and postural balance with and without a cognitive task. The cognitive assessment included the Mini Mental State Examination. Braking performance was measured using a driving simulator … ||Experimental gerontology|2016/12/1|Angelica C Alonso, Mark D Peterson, Alexandre L Busse, Wilson Jacob-Filho, Mauricio TA Borges, Marcos M Serra, Natalia MS Luna, Paulo H Marchetti, Júlia MDA Greve|Pergamon|||85|||13-17||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AVOx2b1Wkg3QC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Acute Effects on Maximal Isometric Force with and without Knee Wrap During Squat Exercise||The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects on maximal isometric force without and with two kinds of knee wraps (hard and soft) during squat exercise. Ten physical active participants were evaluated during this study. All subjects were familiarized with the isometric squat position in all conditions: without and with knee wrap (hard and soft stiffness). The squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric squat contractions in 3 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with soft knee wrap (SKW) and with hard knee wrap (HKW). The peak of force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions WKW and HKW (P= 0.029, ES= 1.27, Δ%= 22%]) and WKW and SKW (P= 0.038, ES= 1.20, Δ%= 21%]). The use of the knee wrap under the presented conditions seem to increase the maximal isometric force during the squat exercise, independent of the level of stiffness of the knee wrap. ||International Journal of Sports Science|2014|Willy Andrade Gomes, Érica Paes Serpa, Enrico Gori Soares, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Daniel Corrêa, Fernando Henrique Domingues de Oliveira, Francisco de Abreu Neto, Gustavo Martins, Guanis de Barros Vilela Junior, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||4|2||47-49||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AiH-uZ7U-co4C%26tzom%3D420

A compreensão de como o exercício de alongamento afeta a UMT auxilia os profissionais a aplicar corretamente está técnica. O objetivo foi revisar a literatura científica sobre os efeitos mecânicos na UMT após sessões agudas de alongamento. O tecido biológico da UMT apresenta diferentes propriedades viscoelásticas que podem ser afetadas com a aplicação de exercícios de alongamento.

Paulo Marchetti ||Efeito agudo dos exercícios de flexibilidade no desempenho de força máxima e resistência de força de membros inferiores e superiores||Este estudo verificou o efeito agudo dos exercícios de flexibilidade estática (EFlex) no desempenho de força máxima (FM) e de resistência de força (RF) em membros inferiores e superiores. Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2012|Anderson Caetano Paulo, Carlos Ugrinowitsch, Gerson dos Santos Leite, Gisela Arsa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Valmor Alberto Augusto Tricoli|Universidade Estadual Paulista|||18|2||345-355||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AMXK_kJrjxJIC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Muscle Activation Differs between Three Different Knee Joint-Angle Positions during a Maximal Isometric Back Squat Exercise||The purpose of this study was to compare muscle activation of the lower limb muscles when performing a maximal isometric back squat exercise over three different positions. Fifteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men performed an isometric back squat at three knee joint angles (20°, 90°, and 140°) in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activation of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), and gluteus maximus (GM). In general, muscle activity was the highest at 90° for the three quadriceps muscles, yet differences in muscle activation between knee angles were muscle specific. Activity of the GM was significantly greater at 20° and 90° compared to 140°. The BF and ST displayed similar activation at all joint angles. In conclusion, knee position alters muscles activation of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles. An isometric back squat at 90° generates the highest overall muscle activation, yet an isometric back squat at 140° generates the lowest overall muscle activation of the VL and GM only. ||Journal of Sports Medicine|2016|P.H.

Paulo Marchetti ||Can the technique of knee wrap placement affect the maximal isometric force during back squat exercise?||The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects on maximal isometric force with two different techniques of knee wraps placement (spiral and X) during back squat exercise. Twenty-one physical active participants were evaluated during this study. The back squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric back squat contractions in 4 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with spiral knee wrap technique (SKW), with X knee wrap technique (XKW) and tensor (T). The peak force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was evaluated after each trial and condition. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions SKW vs WKW (P= 0.044, ES= 0.55, Δ%= 10.8%), and XKW vs WKW (P= 0.009, ES= 0.62, Δ%= 13.6%).

Ten healthy subjects performed two tasks: bipedal quiet standing and a maximal bipedal counter-movement jumping before and after unilateral (with either the dominant or nondominant lower limb) and bilateral (with both lower limbs) fatigue. We employed two force plates (one under each lower limb) to measure the ground reaction forces and center of pressure produced by subjects during the tasks. To quantify the postural sway during quiet standing, we calculated the resultant center of pressure (COP) speed and COP area of sway, as well as the mean weight distribution between lower limbs. To quantify the performance during the countermovement jumping, we calculated the jump height and the peak force of each lower limb. We observed that both unilateral and bilateral fatigue … ||Journal of Applied Biomechanics 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc|2013|Paulo H Marchetti, Maria IV Orselli, Marcos Duarte|Human Kinetics, Inc|||29|1||44-48||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AroLk4NBRz8UC%26tzom%3D420

In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: the curl up (supine trunk raise) and the leg raise (supine bent leg raise) at low intensity (in which only a few motor units are recruited). In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a certain force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the lower and upper portions of the rectus abdominis muscle during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG intensities of the upper and lower portions during the curl up exercise was significantly larger than during the leg raise exercise (p= 0.02).

Paulo Marchetti ||Effect of Resistance Training Frequency on Neuromuscular Performance and Muscle Morphology after Eight Weeks in Trained Men.||The purpose of this study was to investigate the chronic effects of training muscle groups 1 day per week vs. 2 days per week on neuromuscular performance and morphological adaptations in trained men with the number of sets per muscle group equated between conditions. Participants were randomly assigned in 2 experimental groups: 1 session· wk per muscle group (G1, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained once a week with 16 sets or 2 sessions· wk per muscle group (G2, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained twice a week with 8 sets per session. All other variables were held constant over the 8-week study period. No significant difference between conditions for maximal strength in the back squat or bench press, muscle thickness in the elbow extensors, elbow flexors, or quadriceps femoris, and muscle endurance in the back squat and bench press performed at 60% 1RM was detected. Effect size favored G2 for some outcome measurements, suggesting the potential of a slight benefit to the higher training frequency. In conclusion, both G1 and G2 significantly enhance neuromuscular adaptations, with a similar change noted between experimental conditions. ||Journal of strength and conditioning research|2019|Felipe Alves Brigatto, Tiago Volpi Braz, TCDC Zanini, Moisés Diego Germano, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Brad Jon Schoenfeld, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Charles Ricardo Lopes|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A5awf1xo2G04C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Diferentes aquecimentos no desempenho de repetições máximas na musculação||OBJETIVO: Avaliar o efeito de diferentes estratégias de aquecimento no desempenho neuromuscular em adultos jovens submetidos a testes de repetições máximas de membro superior e inferior. MÉTODOS: Dois experimentos foram realizados separadamente. Para o primeiro experimento, 16 adultos jovens hígidos realizaram um teste de repetições máximas a 70% de 1RM no supino reto (previamente determinado). Quatro condições de aquecimento foram testadas: Controle (CON) sem aquecimento prévio, esteira (EST) 5'a 60% VO2max, resistência de força (REF) 15 repetições com 40% de 1RM e força máxima (FM) duas séries de duas repetições com 90% de 1RM. Para o segundo experimento, 14 adultos jovens hígidos, realizaram um teste de repetições máximas a 70% de 1RM no leg press unilateral (previamente determinado). Cinco condições de aquecimento foram testadas: controle (CON) sem aquecimento prévio, esteira (EST) 5'a 60% VO2max, bicicleta (BIC) 5'a 60% VO2max, resistência de força (REF) 15 repetições com 40% de 1RM e força máxima (FM) duas séries de duas repetições com 90% de 1RM. Para ambos os experimentos o número de repetições realizadas e a percepção subjetiva de esforço foram avaliadas. RESULTADOS: Para o primeiro experimento o protocolo FM foi superior a todos os outros protocolos. Não foram observadas diferenças entre as outras condições.

Paulo Marchetti ||Alongamento passivo agudo não afeta a atividade muscular máxima dos ísquiotibiais||The acute stretching may influence the force production in different tasks and sports performances. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of acute passive stretch on the electrical activity of the biceps femoris (BF) and hamstring muscle (HS) strength. Fourteen young adults, sedentary took part of this study. The subjects were asked to produce the maximal isometric contractions before and after a passive stretching protocol. The stretching protocol consisted of three attempts at 60 seconds and resting 15 seconds between each attempt. The subjects were analyzed using the following techniques: maximal isometric force (MIF), integrated electromyography (IEMG) and median frequency (Fmed) of the EMG signal of the BF before and after stretching. We performed the MIF, IEMG and Fmed of the EMG signal under these conditions and compared using a paired Student t test. The MIF of the biceps femoris (14.1 ± 4.9 e 13.1 ± 4.5 Kgf, respectively, p = .12), IEMG (208.4 ± 89.9 e 189.3 ± 75 V.s, respectively, p = .059), and FMed (22.7 ± 4 e 23.4 ± 5.5 Hz, respectively, p = .52) showed no significant differences between conditions before and after stretching. The acute effects of passive stretching did not significantly influence the pattern of electrical activation of the BF and the maximal isometric force produced by the HS. ||Motricidade|2012/12|AS Bley, PS Nardi, PH Marchetti|Revista Motricidade/Edições Desafio Singular|||8|4||80-86||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A4TOpqqG69KYC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Influence of unilateral fatigue of lower limbs on the bilateral vertical jump||It is common to observe bilateral strength deficit during the vertical jump. This is characterized by lower strength produced during bilateral contractions, when compared to the sum of the unilateral contractions of similar muscles. There is not much scientific knowledge about the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral deficit performance during bipedal vertical jump. Ten sedentary young adults unilaterally fatigued each lower limb and performed vertical jumps (bipedal and unipedal). We measured the vertical ground reaction force and myoelectrical activity to each lower limb and conditions (pre-fatigue, fatigue of the dominant limb (FD) and non dominant limb (FND)) were measured. Differences between tasks and conditions only on the pre-fatigue (p=0.030) were observed. Differences were observed for the bipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p=0.005), and unipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p<0.001) and FND (p<0.001). We only observed change on the performance of bipedal vertical jump during the FD condition. We observed a trend to the asymmetry index decrease for the muscular action of the fatigued contralateral lower limb by electromyography. The results suggest that there is a common command where the nervous system considers the muscles simultaneously activated as a unit, except in conditions of unilateral lower limb fatigue. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2011/12|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||17|6||405-408||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AUeHWp8X0CEIC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Influência da fadiga unilateral de membro inferior sobre o salto vertical bilateral||Em saltos verticais é comum a verificação do déficit de força bilateral. Essa é caracterizada pela menor força gerada em contrações bilaterais, quando comparada à soma das contrações unilaterais dos mesmos músculos. Pouco se conhece sobre o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre atividades bilaterais. O objetivo do estudo foi verificar o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre o rendimento e o déficit bilateral durante saltos verticais bipedais. Dez adultos jovens sedentários fatigaram unilateralmente cada membro inferior e realizaram saltos verticais (bipedal e unipedal). Foram medidas a força de reação do solo vertical e a atividade mioelétrica de cada membro em cada condição (pré-fadiga, fadiga do membro dominante (FD) e não dominante (FND)). Houve diferença entre tarefas e condições apenas na pré-fadiga (p= 0,030). Verificaram-se diferenças para o salto bipedal entre a condição de pré-fadiga e FD (p= 0,005), e no salto unipedal, entre a pré-fadiga e FD (p< 0,001) e FND (p< 0,001). Apenas durante a condição de FD houve alteração no desempenho dos saltos bipedais, tendo maior influência no desempenho dos saltos. Observou-se tendência de diminuição do índice de assimetria para a ação muscular do membro contralateral fatigado, observado através de eletromiografia. Através dos dados sugere-se que exista um comando comum onde o sistema nervoso considere os músculos ativados simultaneamente como uma unidade, exceto em condições de fadiga unilateral. ||Rev. bras. med. esporte|2011|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida||||17|6||405-408||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AkNdYIx-mwKoC%26tzom%3D420

(Effects of extensive passive stretching protocol on multiple sets …||Introduction: Stretching exercises have been related to a performance deficit on strength-dependent activities. However, little is known about its effect on multiple sets of strength training. Objective: To determine the effect of an extensive stretching protocol on the performance of multiple sets and soreness in strength training. Methods: The sample was composed by 12 trained-men, experienced in strength training. The protocol consisted of three sessions. The first session was used as a familiarization and load determination to 10 maximum repetitions (T10RM). The second and third conditions were randomized between subjects, and the bench press exercise (BP) was evaluated without previous stretching protocol (SEMA), and with previous stretching protocol (COMA). The stretching protocol consisted of six sets of 45 sec of stretch with 15 sec of resting intervals to the pectoralis major muscle. The stretching intensity was kept between 70 and 90% of the subjective point of discomfort. The local soreness was evaluated before and after exercise by a brief stretching and palpation. The Analysis of Variance ANOVA (2x6) was used to compare the maximum number of repetitions. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the load of the first set of each condition (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). The Student t-test was used to compare the total load and soreness. Results: A decrease on maximum number of repetitions along the sets was observed in both conditions, without differences between them, for the load of the first set, total load and soreness. Conclusion: The number of repetitions in multiple sets was reduced in the same magnitude in the conditions with … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015|Charles Ricardo Lopes, Enrico Gori Soares, A.L.R.

Paulo Marchetti ||Efeito da ordem dos exercícios no treinamento de força||Diversos estudos demonstram que a ordem de execução dos exercícios influenciam a performance neuromuscular em uma sessão de treinamento, e conseqüentemente as suas respostas ao treinamento. O objetivo do presente estudo foi revisar a literatura científica quanto aos efeitos da ordem dos exercícios na performance neuromuscular durante o treinamento de força. Observa-se que o efeito da ordem dos exercícios durante uma sessão de treinamento pode influenciar a performance neuromuscular quando realizados no início da sessão de treinamento quando comparada à sua realização ao final da sessão de treino. A percepção subjetiva de esforço parece não ser afetada pela ordem de execução dos exercícios e o sistema nervoso central parece alterar o padrão de recrutamento dos músculos em exercícios multiarticulares quando precedidos por um exercício monoarticular, aparentemente aumentando a solicitação dos músculos sinérgicos. Intervalos de recuperação maiores parecem afetar menos a performance neuromuscular quando comparados à intervalos menores, independente da sequência dos exercícios. ||Revista CPAQV-Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|2013|Enrico Gori Soares, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||5|3||1-14||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AR3hNpaxXUhUC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício agachamento||Actually the strength training has been widely used in different contexts and for different purposes: athletic, recreational, esthetic and therapeutic. Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions imposed on the squat exercise may result in changes in the action of muscles, kinematics and kinetic, and consequently increasing or decreasing their performance and/or efficiency. ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida–ISSN|2013|Paulo H Marchetti||||5|2||2013||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AhC7cP41nSMkC%26tzom%3D420

Eleven male Parkour practitioners and 12 male physical educators participated in this study and performed: pull-up test, handgrip strength dynamometer test (HSDT), p lyo metric push-up test, maximal horizontal ju mp, and maximal bipodal and unipodal countermovement jumps (CMJ). We calculated limb asymmetry for HSDT and CMJs and the bilateral deficit for CMJs. Significant differences were found between groups for the pull-up test (P= 0.002), plyometric push-up test (P= 0.039), bipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), dominant unipodal CMJ (P= 0.008), nondominant unipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), maximal horizontal jump (P< 0.001), and bilateral deficit (P< 0.004).

Paulo Marchetti ||Investigações sobre o controle motor e postural nas assimetrias em membros inferiores||Durante diferentes atividades cotidianas ou esportivas o ser humano é submetido a desafios unilaterais que podem estar relacionados à performance de uma tarefa específica ou a própria manutenção de sua postura. Portanto, é natural o desenvolvimento motor de um membro em relação ao outro para tarefas específicas, desde que estas sejam repetidas de forma não simétrica. Desta forma, pode-se supor que sujeitos que possuam maiores estresses físicos unilaterais apresentem maior probabilidade em desenvolver assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas. O presente trabalho apresenta três diferentes experimentos visando investigar as assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas relacionadas ao controle de movimento para tarefas dinâmicas e estáticas em diferentes condições e grupos. O primeiro experimento visou investigar as diferenças, entre os membros inferiores, no controle de movimento entre sedentários e atletas, utilizando para isto a postura ereta quieta e o salto com contra-movimento nas condições bipedais e unipedais. O segundo experimento visou investigar o efeito da fadiga neuromuscular unilateral e bilateral no controle de movimento, entre membros, durante o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta bipedal. O terceiro experimento objetivou investigar o efeito prolongado da temporada esportiva no controle de movimento, entre membros, de atletas, utilizando o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta nas condições unipedal e bipedal. Inicialmente, o presente trabalho concluiu que não parece existir relação entre as diferenças antropométricas e funcionais.

Paulo Marchetti ||Effect of eccentric velocity on muscle damage markers after bench press exercise in resistance-trained men.||Aim. The purpose of this study was to determine how the execution velocity of eccentric exercises affects postexercise muscle damage in resistance-trained males using free-weight exercises. Methods. Twenty young males were divided by maximum eccentric strength into two groups: slow eccentric velocity (SEV, N.= 10) and fast eccentric velocity (FEV, N.= 10). Both groups performed four sets of eight repetitions with 70% of their one repetition maximum eccentric in a bench press exercise with a 2-minute rest interval between sets. Each group lifted an equal total volume load. The eccentric velocity was controlled to 3 seconds for the SEV group and 0.5 seconds for the FEV group. The 1RM test, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and creatine kinase (CK) activity were evaluated before and up to 96 hours postexercise. Results. A significant reduction (compared with baseline values) in 1RM test was observed up to 48 hours postexercise for the FEV group, while a significant reduction for the SEV group was only observed at 24 hours. The FEV group had a significant increase in DOMS up to 72 hours postexercise while the SEV group experienced an increase lasting up to 48 hours. The serum CK activity increased significantly only at 72 hours postexercise for both groups. There were no significant differences for any of the indirect analyses of muscle damage when the values were compared between groups. Conclusion.

Paulo Marchetti ||Comparison of the Postural Control Performance of Collegiate Basketball Players and Nonathletes||Athletes who play basketball are at risk for ankle injuries. Whether athletes demonstrate different postural stability and limb asymmetry during a quiet standing task compared with nonathletes is unknown. Fifteen collegiate basketball players and 15 nonathletes performed 3 trials of bipedal quiet standing for 30 s with 60 s of rest. Postural stability measures were obtained for each limb: integration of the resultant of the center of pressure (COP) speed (anteroposterior [AP] and mediolateral [ML] directions); COP area; and frequency (AP and ML). An asymmetry index between lower limbs was calculated for COP speed (AP and ML), COP area, and weight distribution.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible to early muscle fatigue. The objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of LED on muscle function, exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory responses during isometric and dynamic exercise in patients with COPD. This study will assess 30 patients with moderate to severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume-one second,FEV1 ≤70% predicted). Isometric and dynamic protocols will be conducted in two visits each, for a total of four visits a week apart. First, venous blood will be taken from the patients. The isometric protocol will start with the determination of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MIVC) to determine the workload (60% of MIVC) for the isometric endurance test (IET). Patients will be randomized to receive either the placebo or LED application (each point will be irradiated for 30 s and the energy received at each point will be 41.7 J). Immediately after finishing this procedure, the patients will carry out the IET until the limit of tolerance or until a 20% fall of strength is observed. After the test, another blood draw will be taken. In another visit (one week later), the same order of procedures will be performed, except with the opposite (LED or placebo). For the dynamic endurance test (DET), the same procedures described above will be followed, except with 75% of the maximal workload obtained from the incremental cycle ergometer test used instead of the IET.

Paulo Marchetti ||Acute Effects of Stretching Routines with and without Rest Intervals between Sets in the Bounce Drop Jump Performance||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of static-stretching (SS) session with (intermittent) and without (continuous) rest intervals between sets on the bounce drop jump performance, with the same volume and intensity. The experimental protocol consisted of (1) a brief warm-up using sub-maximal jumps;(2) a pre-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for each lower limb);(3) ankle plantar flexors SS protocol (intermittent or continuous) was used only for a single-lower limb;(4) immediate post-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for the stretched lower limb). Then, subjects rest for 30 minutes and the topics 3-4 were repeated with the other lower limb and stretching protocol. The intensity used for both stretching protocols was between 70-90% of the point of discomfort. There were significant decrease in jumping height performance for both stretching protocols: continuous (P= 0.001) and intermittent (P= 0.006). There were significant increase in contact time only for the continuous protocol (P= 0.025). Our findings indicated that both stretching protocols (intermittent or continuous) were effective to increase the passive ankle ROM, and to decrease the single-leg jump height, however only the continuous SS protocol showed increases in the contact time. ||International Journal of Sports Science|2015|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Enrico Gori Soares, Fernando Henrique Domingues Oliveira Silva, Priscyla Silva Monteiro Nardi, Érica Paes Serpa, Willy Andrade Gomes, Brad J.

Paulo Marchetti ||Efeito de diferentes durações do alongamento no desempenho de saltos unipodais||A prática de exercícios de alongamento é muito comum como parte do aquecimento em diversas modalidades esportivas, porém, esta prática pode ser negativa para aqueles que desejam o aprimoramento da força e potência muscular, consequentemente, o rendimento dos saltos pode ficar reduzido após exercícios de alongamento, que depende do tempo de duração e intensidade do mesmo. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a influência do tempo de permanência no exercício alongamento sobre o desempenho do drop jump unilateralmente (unipodal). MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta por 16 adultos jovens hígidos, com larga experiência em saltos. O protocolo de teste consistiu em realizar três drop jumps unipodais máximos a partir de uma plataforma de 15 cm sobre um tapete de salto (Hidrofit (r)), antes e após duas durações (ie uma série 3 min. de um lado, e 6 min. para outro, a escolha foi de forma aleatória) de … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2014|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Enrico Gori Soares, Fernando Henrique Domingues Oliveira Silva, Iris Ilza de Medeiros, Ilídio dos Reis Neto, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Marco Carlos Uchida, Reury Frank Pereira Bacurau||||20|3||223-226||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Anb7KW1ujOQ8C%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of a full season on stabilometric Parameters of team handball elite athletes.||It is unclear whether athletes change their postural control over the course of a full sport season, or become more asymmetrical with respect to their neuromuscular performance over the same period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a full sport season on the postural control of team handball elite athletes. Ten healthy, elite male team handball players performed bipodal standing (BP) and right and left unipodal standing (UP) during 30s. We used the RMS and speed of the center of pressure to describe postural sway. For the BP task, the sway was lower at the end of the season (p<0.005). For the UP tasks, the sway was lower at the end of the season only for the non-dominant limb (p<0.001). Differences between limbs were observed only at the end of the season (p<0.03). In conclusion, a full team handball season did not lead to deterioration of the athletes' postural control, but by the end of the season, the athletes were more asymmetrical. ||Motriz|2014|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Maria Isabel Veras Orselli, Lúcio M.

High resistance-training frequency enhances muscle thickness in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res XX (X): 000–000, 2018—The purpose of this study was to compare the effect a split training routine with muscle groups trained once per week (SPLIT) vs. whole-body split training routine with muscle groups trained 5 days per week (TOTAL) on neuromuscular adaptations in well-trained men. Eighteen healthy men (height= 177.8 6 6.6 cm; total body mass= 84.4 6 8.1 kg; age= 26.4 6 4.6 years) were recruited to participate in this study. The experimental groups were matched according to baseline strength and then randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 experimental groups: SPLIT (n= 9) or TOTAL (n= 9). Prestudy and poststudy testing included 1RM for bench press, parallel back-squat and machine close-grip seated row, as well as an ultrasound analysis of the muscle thickness (MT) of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and vastus lateralis. After 8 weeks of training, no significant difference between groups was noted for all 1RM tests (p. 0.05 AU2). TOTAL induced a significantly greater increase in MT of the forearm flexors and vastus lateralis (p, 0.05). In conclusion, muscle strength increment is similar regardless of the experimental conditions studied; however, TOTAL may confer a potentially superior hypertrophic effect. ||The Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research|2019|Rafael S Zaroni, Felipe A Brigatto, Brad J Schoenfeld, Tiago V Braz, Júlio C Benvenutti, Moisés D Germano, Paulo H Marchetti, Marcelo S Aoki, Charles R Lopes|LWW||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AUHK10RUVsp4C%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||The effect of different resistance training load schemes on strength and body composition in trained men.||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of moderate-load (10 RM) and low-load (20 RM) resistance training schemes on maximal strength and body composition. Sixteen resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a moderate-load group (n= 8) or a low-load group (n= 8). The resistance training schemes consisted of 8 exercises performed 4 times per week for 6 weeks. In order to equate the number of repetitions performed by each group, the moderate load group performed 6 sets of 10 RM, while the low load group performed 3 sets of 20 RM. Between-group differences were evaluated using a 2-way ANOVA and independent t-tests. There was no difference in the weekly total load lifted (sets× reps× kg) between the 2 groups. Both groups equally improved maximal strength and measures of body composition after 6 weeks of resistance training, with no significant between-group … ||Jounal of Human Kinetics|2017|C.R.

Paulo Marchetti ||Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício pulley||Muitos são os exercícios utilizados para o desenvolvimento dos músculos que envolvem os membros superiores (particularmente o latíssimo do dorso, peitoral maior, redondo maior, deltóide parte espinal e bíceps braquial). Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos do exercício pulley que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino como o deslocamento da barra em relação ao tronco, os diferentes tipos de pegada (supinada e pronada) e as variações no comprimento da pegada na barra. O entendimento destas variações técnicas do exercício pulley podem influenciar a correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício pulley e suas variações. Poucos são os estudos que analisam as variações na técnica do exercício pulley, mas puderam ser observadas que diferentes alterações mecânicas realizadas podem acarretar em mudanças na ação dos músculos envolvidos neste exercício, aumentando ou diminuindo a performance e/ou sua eficiência. ||Revista de Atenção à Saúde (antiga Rev.

Paulo Marchetti ||Variáveis objetivas e subjetivas para monitoramento de diferentes ciclos de temporada em jogadores de basquete||O presente estudo teve o objetivo de avaliar, comparar e relacionar carga e cansaço causado por treinamento durante um ciclo de periodização em jogadores de basquete. Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21,9 ± 3,4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4,6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p < 0,005) no período preparatório (13,71 ± 1,30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14,68 ± 1,51) e competitivo II (14,63 ± 1,22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p < 0,005) no período competitivo II (3,59 ± 0,30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3,80 ± 0,36) e competitivo I (3,86 ± 0,26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p < 0,001) no período competitivo II (1,18 ± 0,43) em comparação com o preparatório (2,50 ± 2,01) e competitivo I (2,10 ± 1,61). Os resultados revelaram a efetividade na monitoração da carga e cansaço dos atletas através do método proposto para auxiliar na organização do treinamento durante um macrociclo. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2012/8/1|Gerson dos Santos Leite, Jonato Prestes, Christiano Bertoldo Urtado, Paulo H Marchetti, Carlos Roberto Padovani, Carlos Roberto Pereira Padovani, Maria Regina Ferreira Brandão, João Paulo Borin|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ACHSYGLWDkRkC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Acute effect of stretching exercises on upper and lower limbs maximum strength and strength endurance performance||Este estudo verificou o efeito agudo dos exercícios de flexibilidade estática (EFlex) no desempenho de força máxima (FM) e de resistência de força (RF) em membros inferiores e superiores. Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2012/6|Anderson Caetano Paulo, Carlos Ugrinowitsch, Gerson dos Santos Leite, Gisela Arsa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Valmor Tricoli|Motriz: revista de educação física (Online)|||18|2||345-355||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ALkGwnXOMwfcC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Desempenho dos membros inferiores após reconstrução do ligamento cruzado anterior||O desempenho dos membros inferiores em tarefas dinâmicas pode auxiliar no entendimento do controle motor em indivíduos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA. Os objetivos do presente estudo foram investigar o déficit bilateral e a simetria entre os membros inferiores de sujeitos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA e comparar com sujeitos não lesionados. Vinte adultos jovens foram divididos em dois grupos (LCA e controle). A tarefa consistiu na execução do exercício Leg Press (unilateral direita e esquerda e bilateral). O número de repetições máximas (RM) foi quantificado e então o déficit bilateral e o índice de assimetria foram calculados. Os resultados mostraram assimetria no número de RM realizada entre membros no grupo LCA (p= 0,005) e apenas o grupo controle apresentou déficit bilateral (p= 0,004). Conclui-se que indivíduos que realizaram a reconstrução do LCA apresentaram assimetrias entre membros, sem a presença de déficit bilateral. ||Motriz rev educ fís|2012|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Eduardo Garcia Bucchianico, Tatiane Amore, Priscyla Silva Monteiro Nardi, Júlio Cesar Gali, Marco Carlos Uchida||||18|3||441-8||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AzYLM7Y9cAGgC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Static stretching of the pectoralis major decreases triceps brachii activation during a maximal isometric bench press||BACKGROUND: Static stretching (SS) not only increases the range of motion (ROM) of the stretched muscle but can also enhance the ROM of homonymous and heteronymous contralateral muscles. Whereas prolonged SS can lead to performance impairments of the stretched muscle, deficits in muscle activation have not been investigated with non-stretched muscles that contribute to a task such as a bench press. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged SS of the pectoralis major muscle on the synergic activation of the pectoralis major (PM) and triceps brachii (TB) muscle during an isometric bench press action. METHODS: Fourteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men had their shoulder complex passively stretched (horizontal abduction) with six stretches of 45-s each, with 15-s rest between each stretch at an intensity of 70-90% of the point of discomfort.

Paulo Marchetti ||La Respuesta Morfológica y de Rendimiento en el Entrenamiento de Pilates en Mujeres Activas-Ciencias del Ejercicio||El propósito de este estudio fue investigar la activación muscular y la fatiga después del entrenamiento de Pilates de alto volumen y las implicaciones agudas en el rendimiento de la fuerza y las respuestas morfológicas relacionadas con el tejido muscular de los miembros inferiores. Doce mujeres jóvenes sanas y entrenadas realizaron una sesión de Pilates con una Silla Wunda. En dos momentos distintos (pre y post-intervención), se registraron las imágenes de resonancia magnética (RM) ponderadas por el tiempo de relajación transversal (T2) y las evaluaciones isocinéticas de las extremidades inferiores. Hubo aumentos significativos en la intensidad de la señal T2 post-intervención en el glúteo mayor y en toda la porción muscular (proximal, medial y distal) del vasto lateral y del recto femoral. Hubo disminuciones significativas en: el rendimiento de pre a post-intervención en el pico de torque, el trabajo total y la potencia media del momento de extensión. Sin embargo, en el momento de la flexión, no hubo diferencias significativas en el rendimiento entre la pre-y la post-intervención. Los resultados confirman que el método Pilates, cuando se aplica con el control de variables tales como series de tiempo, repeticiones e intervalos de descanso, promueve una modificación de la fuerza muscular y el volumen de los grupos musculares afectados. La capacidad de manipular variables de entrenamiento cuando se aplica al aparato de Pilates promueve cambios agudos similares como se informó en estudios de entrenamiento de fuerza. ||PubliCE|2017|Ticiane Marcondes Fonseca da Cruz, Fernando de Oliveira Rosa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Natalia Mariana Silva Luna, Thiago Antonio Fedele, Julia Maria D’Andrea Greve, Marcelo Bordalo Rodrigues, Rozangela Verlengia, Charles Ricardo Lopes|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AeMMeJKvmdy0C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||EFEITOS AGUDOS E ADAPTAÇÕES NEUROMUSCULARES DECORRENTE DA MANIPULAÇÃO DE VOLUME E DENSIDADE NO TREINAMENTO DE FORÇA||A manipulação do volume e da densidade no treinamento de força é realizada através do gerenciamento do número de séries realizadas em cada grupamento muscular e como essas séries são alocadas na sessão e na semana de treinamento. A manipulação dessas variáveis altera as respostas agudas e as adaptações crônicas no sistema neuromuscular. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi revisar os efeitos agudos e adaptações neuromusculares decorrentes da manipulação diária e semanal do volume e densidade no treinamento de força. A combinação da ordem dos exercícios, sistemas de treinamentos e séries realizadas tem demonstrado ser uma estratégia eficiente para aumentar o desempenho e reduzir o tempo da sessão de treinamento. Estudos prévios sugerem que o aumento da sobrecarga pode ser realizado através da manipulação das séries na sessão do treinamento e do número de sessões ao longo da semana. Quanto à frequência de treinamento, a literatura parece ser clara ao sugerir ganhos superiores de força e hipertrofia muscular quando duas a três sessões por grupamento muscular são realizadas na semana. Entretanto, frequências de até 6 sessões na semana para o mesmo grupo muscular podem favorecer o anabolismo muscular. A presente revisão conclui que em uma única sessão de treinamento até 30 séries por grupo muscular podem ser necessárias dependendo do objetivo e da população treinada. O desempenho agudo da sessão (volume absoluto, força e potência) pode ser melhorado por meio de diferentes ordens de exercícios ou sistemas de treinamento quando essas estratégias … ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|2017|Enrico Gori Soares, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||9|2||2||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Aolpn-zPbct0C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||INTERMITTENT AND CONTINUOUS STRETCHING INCREASE RANGE OF MOTION AND DECREASE FORCE ON WRIST FLEXORS||Objetivo: Comparar o efeito do intervalo de alongamento estático de forma continua e intermitente no desempenho de flexores de punho. Métodos A amostra foi composta por 14 adultos jovens, hígidos, do gênero masculino (idade 31±9 anos; estatura 178±0, 7 cm; massa 85±12 Kg). Foi avaliada a amplitude de movimento passivo (ADMP) em extensão de punho, a força isométrica máxima de flexão de punho associado a eletromiografia superficial antes e depois de dois protocolos de alongamento com diferentes intervalos entre séries. Para cada sujeito, um dos membros superiores foi alongado com o protocolo contínuo (CON) e o outro com o intermitente (INT), de forma aleatória. O protocolo CON consistiu na realização do alongamento durante 6 minutos ininterruptos, e o INT consistiu na realização de seis séries de 1 minuto por 20 segundos de intervalo entre as séries. A intensidade foi mantida a 70-90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Resultados Os resultados de ADMP mostraram aumento significante entre as condições pré e pós-intervenção, em ambos os protocolos INT (81±10 e 94±10, P< 0,001) e CON (87±12 e 96±11, P= 0,004).

Paulo Marchetti ||Acute effects on performance of the vertical jump after back squat with knee wraps||INTRODUCTION: Knee wraps can affect the muscular performance during high-intensity exercises by reducing muscle activation, which may influence the effect of post-activation potentiation, which depends on high intensity for the following power exercise. Objective: To investigate the acute effects on the performance with counter-movement jump (CMJ) after high-intensity squat with and without the use of knee wraps in resistance trained subjects. METHODS: The study included 14 men (aged 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, weight: 81±11kg, 1RM: 107±30kgf) resistance trained (>3 years). Three SCM were performed before and after three back squats at 90% of 1RM with and without the knee wraps. During the CMJ muscle activation (IEMG) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), jump time (JT), and impulse (IMP) through the force of vertical ground reaction (FRSV) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results show statistically significant differences for JT between post-back-squat conditions (with and without wrap) (P=0.044, TE=1.02), whereas the highest values were observed without knee wrap. For IEMG of VL significant difference between pre and post-conditions after back squat (with knee wrap) (P=0.029, TE=1.68) was observed, and the highest values were observed for the IEMG with knee wrap. No significant differences between conditions were observed for IEMG of GM and IMP. CONCLUSION: After using the knee wraps during the squat exercise, there was a reduction in the involvement of the vastus lateralis during the jump with counter-movement, affecting the contact time, but not the production of impulse and consequent … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015/8|Willy Andrade Gomes, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Enrico Gori Soares, Erica Paes Serpa, Daniel Alves Corrêa, Vilela Junior, Guanis de Barros, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||21|4||257-260||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AnrtMV_XWKgEC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of passive stretching protocol on multiple sets performance in resistance training||OBJETIVO: Determinar o efeito do alongamento passivo extensivo no desempenho de séries múltiplas e da dor percebida no treinamento de força. MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta de 12 homens experientes com treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira serviu como familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos, sendo uma realizada com a avaliação do supino reto (SR) sem alongamento prévio (SEMA), e a outra com alongamento prévio (COMA). O protocolo de alongamento consistiu de seis séries de 45 seg de alongamento por 15 seg de intervalo visando o músculo peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após o exercício, a dor local foi avaliada por meio de breve alongamento e palpação. A Análise de Variância ANOVA (2x6) com medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar a carga da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). O teste-t de Student foi utilizado para comparar a carga total com a dor. RESULTADOS: Observou-se decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições, sem diferenças entre as mesmas, para a carga da primeira série, a carga total e a dor. CONCLUSÃO: O número de repetições em séries múltiplas é diminuído na mesma magnitude com e sem a realização do alongamento prévio, além de não alterar a carga total e a dor percebida. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015/6|Charles Ricardo Lopes, Enrico Gori Soares, André Luis Rodrigues Santos, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||21|3||224-229||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AcFHS6HbyZ2cC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Maximum number of repetitions performed by resistance-trained men: Effect of maximum load intensity and exercise selection||The purpose of this study was to compare the number of maximum repetitions (RMs) performed at 80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) and 80% of one-repetition maximum eccentric (1RMecc) test for the preacher-curl (PC) and the bench-press (BP) exercises. Fifteen resistance-trained men participated in this counterbalanced-crossover study. There was no significant difference in the number of RMs performed at 80%-1RM (PC: 7.0±1.2 RMs and BP: 5.8±1.3 RMs) and 80%-1RMecc (PC: 6.0±1.1 RMs and BP: 5.4±1.1 RMs) for both exercises. No significant difference in the numbers of RMs was detected between the PC (80%-1RM: 7.0±1.2 RMs and 80%-1RMecc: 6.0±1.1 RMs) and BP exercises (80%-1RM: 5.8±1.3 RMs and 80%-1RMecc: 5.4±1.1 RMs) for both intensities. In conclusion, the number of RMs performed by resistance-trained men was not affected by the maximum load intensity based on muscle action and the exercise selection. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2014/6|Charles R Lopes, Alex H Crisp, Rozangela Verlengia, Cesar A Macarrone, Dyego A Peghim, Gustavo R Mota, Marcelo S Aoki, Paulo H Marchetti|Motriz: revista de educação física (Online)|||20|2||221-225||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AM3NEmzRMIkIC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Os efeitos da suplementação de creatina na performance de corredores velocistas (100 e 200 metros)||O uso da creatina enquanto recurso ergogênico para atletas visando o ganho de massa muscular e aprimoramento da performance, vem sendo difundido no meio esportivo. As provas que envolvem força e potência no atletismo (corridas de velocidade, saltos, arremesso e lançamentos) são modalidades onde o uso desse recurso ergogênico é muito requisitado. Diversas pesquisas acerca da suplementação de creatina estão sendo realizadas e por mais que alguns estudos mostrem resultados que apontem para uma efetividade do produto na melhora de capacidades físicas de atletas, principalmente força e potência, outros trabalhos ainda não validam tal método, portanto o presente estudo teve como objetivo comparar os resultados dos testes, de velocidade (30 metros), Sprint de 100 metros e corrida de 40 segundos, realizados por dois grupo de seis atletas de elite nacional (18 a 25 anos) praticantes das provas de corrida de velocidade (100 e 200 metros), submetidos a um mesociclo (3 semanas) de treinamento específico, acompanhado de um programa de suplementação, no qual um grupo realizou a ingestão de creatina, sendo administrada 20g/dia divididos em 4 doses de 5g durante a primeira semana (5 dias), seguido por uma fase de manutenção de 3g/dia na segunda e terceira semana (10 dias). E o outro grupo seguiu o mesmo protocolo de suplementação, porém teve a creatina substituída por placebo.

Paulo Marchetti ||Investigações sobre o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome||O músculo reto do abdome é um importante músculo da parede abdominal, responsável pela estabilização e função da coluna, tanto em atividades atléticas quanto em atividades cotidianas. Entretanto, pouco se conhece sobre o controle neuromotor de tal estrutura em atividades voluntárias, como os exercícios abdominais, e como as diferentes tarefas agem na ativação segmentada das porções musculares do músculo reto do abdome. Em geral, a presente dissertação teve como objetivo investigar o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome em diferentes tarefas voluntárias através de quatro experimentos. O primeiro experimento teve como objetivo descrever as características morfológicas do músculo reto do abdome, em particular sua área de secção transversa, ao longo do comprimento longitudinal do músculo, utilizando as imagens do projeto homem visível (NLM). O segundo experimento objetivou o mapeamento dos pontos motores para cada porção muscular. O terceiro experimento investigou o controle neuromotor das diversas porções musculares em tarefas isométricas de baixa intensidade. E por fim, o quarto experimento investigou o comportamento das porções musculares em diferentes tarefas isométricas em condição de fadiga neuromuscular. Baseado nos experimentos apresentados neste estudo pode-se concluir que o músculo reto do abdome é uma estrutura extremamente complexa em sua arquitetura, sendo caracterizada por diversas porções musculares que se interconectam através de aponeuroses tendíneas, onde, possivelmente nenhuma fibra muscular atravesse seus ventres.

Paulo Marchetti ||The effect of dominant first dorsal interosseous fatigue on the force production of a contralateral homologous and heterologous muscle.||Crossover and non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) has generally focused on large muscle groups. It is unclear whether fatigue of a small muscle can result in NLMF of a larger muscle. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of small muscle (first dorsal interosseous; FDI) fatigue on the force and activation of contralateral homologous and larger heterologous muscles (biceps brachii, BB). Fifteen right-handed, male subjects performed three pre-test index finger abduction or elbow flexion maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) on the non-dominant side. Subsequently, they performed two 100s index finger abduction MVICs on the dominant side (experimental [fatigue] group) or rested for 5 minutes (control group). Afterwards, a single MVIC and a 12 repetition MVIC fatiguing protocol were completed with index finger abduction or elbow flexion on the non-dominant side.

Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of elastic wrap on muscle activation and isometric force of knee extensor.||Introduction: The elastic knee wrap (EKW) is a device used by powerlifters, weightlifters and subjects undergoing strength training with the aim of stabilizing the knee joint and increasing the development of strength (carryover effect). Objective: To compare the effects of elastic knee wrap use on muscular activity of the vastus lateralis (VL) and on knee extension force during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) on the knee extensor chair. Methods: The study included 18 healthy male strength trained (>1 year) subjects (age: 25.56 ± 4.84 years, total body mass: 81.83 ± 8.73 kg, height: 176 cm ± 5.17). Three five-second maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the knee extensors were performed with a 10-second interval between attempts, for each experimental condition: control (C), with elastic knee wrap (EKW), and with tensor (T). The performance of the knee extensors and VL muscle activity were evaluated. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the dependent variables (carryover, peak force, IEMG and Impulse). Results: For carryover, the use of EKW presented a higher value (74.21%) than the control condition (p <0.001, d = 0.96) and was 79.37% higher than the tensor (p <0.001, d = 0.97). Peak force was 12.2% higher in condition C compared to EKW (p = .018, d = 0.71). For impulse, the control condition presented an increase of 8% compared to EKW use (p = .015, d = 0.62). No significant differences were observed for IEMG. Conclusion: Elastic knee wrap use increased strength production capacity during knee extension.

Paulo Marchetti ||Elbow wrap improves bench press performance in trained subjects.||Introduction: The elastic wrap is widely used by different types of athletes and recreational practitioners of strength training in order to improve weightlifting performance. Objective: The objective was to investigate the acute effects of elbow wrap on strength performance, absolute volume, and rating of perceived exertion/discomfort during the bench press (BP) exercise. Methods: The experimental protocol was divided into three laboratory sessions. At the first session, a bench press familiarization phase was performed with (EW) and without (WEW) elastic elbow wrap. During the second session, the 1RM test was carried out in the bench press exercise under both EW and WEW conditions. At the third session, the repetition maximum (RM) test at 70% of 1RM (EW and WEW) was performed until concentric failure. After each session, subjects were consulted about their rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and discomfort (PSD). A paired student t-test was used to compare the values of 1RM and RMs with and without elastic wraps. Descriptive analysis was used for RPE and PSD. Results: For the 1RM test, there was a significant increase for the EW condition when compared to WEW (p<0.05). In the RMs test and absolute volume calculation, there was a significant increase for the EW condition (p<0.05). RPE did not differ in any of the conditions tested (p>0.05). PSD presented a high degree of discomfort with elastic wraps in all conditions. Conclusion: Elastic elbow wraps increase the load lifted in the 1RM test, and the maximum number of repetitions during the BP exercise, and consequently, the absolute volume.

Paulo Marchetti ||Different load distributions affect acute neuromuscular responses and muscle thickness in resistance-trained men.||The aim of the present study was to compare acute neuromuscular responses and muscle thickness of a resistance training session with continuous-vs. grouped-sets. The experimental procedures were performed across three sessions in a crossover and random fashion. During the first session, all subjects were familiarized and the 10RM load was determined for both exercises: biceps curl (BC) and triceps extension (TE). The following two sessions were randomized for continuous-or grouped-sets. For continuous-sets, 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise (BC and TE) were performed sequentially, while for grouped-sets, each exercise was alternated every 4 sets until 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise were completed. Two minutes of rest was used between sets and exercises. Volume load and muscle thickness (biceps brachii, MTBB, and triceps brachii, MTTB) were measured pre-and post-exercise. Peak force and myoelectric activity (iEMG) were measured for each exercise (BC and TE) and each muscle (biceps brachii and triceps brachii) during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction test. Results demonstrated that volume load was significantly greater in grouped-sets for both exercises (P< 0.001). MTBB and MTTB increased after both sessions (P< 0.001), however, there was a greater effect with continuous-sets when compared to grouped-sets (P= 0.001). Peak force decreased for both exercises and sets (P< 0.05). iEMG decreased only after continuous-sets for both muscles (P< 0.001). In conclusion, continuous-and grouped-sets resulted in specific neuromuscular responses and similar muscle thickness for prime movers.

Methods: Ten healthy young men (age: 23±6.5 years; total body mass: 82.8±10.6 kg, height: 177.3±0.1 cm) randomly performed 3 resistance exercise sessions with different rest intervals between sets (30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds). The resistance exercise sessions consisted of 6 full-body exercises (bench press; seated low row; shoulder press; back squat; leg press 45 and seated calf raise) performed with 4 sets of 10 repetitions maximum (RM). Total load lifted (sets× repetitions× load (Kgf)) and lactate blood concentration were determined for each exercise session. One way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test were used for multiple comparisons. Results: The total load lifted was significantly (P< 0.001) lower for 30 seconds (26382.0±4100.3 kg) rest interval compared with 60 seconds (28864.5±4139.7 kg) and 120 seconds (30064.4±3966.4 kg).

Paulo Marchetti ||Landing techniques affect performance and mechanical stress during Drop Jump||Introduction: The drop jump is used to improve the power of the lower limbs. Keeping the drop height constant, the variation of the landing technique can modify the performance and the mechanical characteristics of the jump. Objective: To evaluate the effects of different landing techniques on the performance and the reaction force of the vertical component of the ground after drop jump. Methods: Twenty-five healthy and physically active men (age: 26±8 years, total body mass: 75±10 kg, height: 175±10 cm) performed four landing techniques after the drop jump: bounce drop jump (BDJ), drop jump with 90° of knee flexion (DJ90), drop jump with 135° of knee flexion (DJ135), and drop jump with 135° of knee flexion with hands resting on the ground (DJ135A). Three attempts were performed for each technique; the subjects performed the drop jump falling from a 40 cm high force platform. The measures of jump height, contact time and impact were determined by the force of reaction of the vertical component of the ground, measured by the force platform, at a frequency of acquisition of 2,000 Hz. The repeated measures by ANOVA were used to compare the different techniques. Results: The BDJ technique presented lower jump height, shorter contact time and greater impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). The DJ90 technique presented jump height similar to the DJ135 and DJ135A techniques and a short contact time (P<0.001) and a lower impact than the other techniques (P<0.001).

Na terceira idade, é maior a pré-disposição para as doenças crônicas degenerativas, dentre elas a osteoporose, considerada um problema de saúde mundial. As mulheres são mais suscetíveis a esta doença pois, além de terem menor massa óssea que o homem, quando chegam na fase da menopausa, apresentam maior descalcificação óssea, aumentando o risco de fraturas. Neste sentido, o treinamento de força é um grande aliado na prevenção dessa patologia, proporcionando bem-estar físico e mental, aumento da massa muscular e proteção dos ossos quanto a possíveis lesões e, se associado com algum método farmacológico, auxilia diretamente no tratamento da osteoporose. A presente revisão faz uma abordagem sobre a importância do treinamento de força em mulheres menopausadas e a profilaxia no desenvolvimento da osteoporose, favorecendo uma melhor qualidade de vida. A prática do treinamento de força proporciona à mulher idosa e portadora da osteoporose, maior flexibilidade e mobilidade, permitindo maior independência nas atividades da vida diária. ||Saúde em Foco|2017|Hilary Silvia-Goldberg||It's a Nuisance: The Future of Fracking Litigation in the Wake of Parr v.

By February 1996, the initiative influenced the National Football League's decision to allow Cleveland to keep the legacy of the Browns and offer the city a new team. Letters found at the Pro Football Hall of Fame show how the Save Our Browns campaign illuminated a "culture of losing"–the combination of a declining city, poor sports teams, and angst from social change–in the greater Cleveland community. I argue that Clevelanders' fight for the Browns represented their desire for a Cleveland of the past that included an idealized blue-collar identity consisting of expressions of heteronormative, white masculinity. These expressions show how some considered sports more important than other forms of social change in the Rust Belt city in the … ||Journal of Sport History|2015/10/18|Andrew D Linden|University of Illinois Press|||42|3||340-0360||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=og40OCIAAAAJ
Paulo Marchetti ||Age-related changes in human postural control of prolonged standing||The aim of this study was to characterize prolonged standing and its effect on postural control in elderly individuals in comparison to adults. It is unknown how elderly individuals behave during prolonged standing and how demanding such a task is for them. We recorded the center of pressure (COP) position of 14 elderly subjects and 14 adults while they performed prolonged standing (30 min) and quiet stance tasks (60 s) on a force plate. The number and amplitude of the COP patterns, the root mean square (RMS), speed, and frequency of the COP sway were analyzed. The elderly subjects were able to stand for prolonged periods but they produced postural changes of lesser amplitude and a decreased sway during the prolonged standing task. Both the adults and the elderly subjects were influenced by the prolonged standing task, as demonstrated by their increased COP RMS and COP speed in the quiet … ||Gait & posture|2005/12/1|Sandra MSF Freitas, Silvana A Wieczorek, Paulo H Marchetti, Marcos Duarte|Elsevier|||22|4||322-330||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Au5HHmVD_uO8C%26tzom%3D420

Indubitavelmente, um dos exercícios mais utilizados no treinamento de força, visando o desenvolvimento da musculatura superior do tronco é o supino. O entendimento das diversas variações do exercício supino pode influenciar na correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar diversos aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício supino, além de suas possíveis variações como as inclinações do banco, o afastamento da empunhadura, a amplitude de movimento, as diferenças entre o exercício supino guiado e não guiado e as diferenças entre o supino em base estável e instável.

Paulo Marchetti ||Propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a biomechanical study||Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF … ||PloS one|2014/5/15|Andre Serra Bley, Joao Carlos Ferrari Correa, Amir Curcio Dos Reis, Nayra Deise Dos Anjos Rabelo, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucareli|Public Library of Science|||9|5||e97606||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AisC4tDSrTZIC%26tzom%3D420

Eight healthy male volunteers took part in the study. The EMG activity of the pectoralis major and that of the latissimus dorsi of the right side were acquired simultaneously during the pullover exercise with a free-weight barbell during both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement. After a warm-up, all the subjects were asked to perform the pullover exercise against an external load of 30% of their body weight, during 1 set × 10 repetitions. The criterion adopted to normalize the EMG data was the maximal voluntary isometric activation. The present findings demonstrated that the barbell pullover exercise emphasized the muscle action of the pectoralis major more than that of the latissimus dorsi, and the higher activation depended on the external force lever arm … ||Journal of applied biomechanics|2011/11|Paulo H Marchetti, Marco C Uchida||||27|4||380-384||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AqjMakFHDy7sC%26tzom%3D420

All subjects performed three maximal isometric squat contractions in 3 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with soft knee wrap (SKW) and with hard knee wrap (HKW). The peak of force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions WKW and HKW (P= 0.029, ES= 1.27, Δ%= 22%]) and WKW and SKW (P= 0.038, ES= 1.20, Δ%= 21%]). The use of the knee wrap under the presented conditions seem to increase the maximal isometric force during the squat exercise, independent of the level of stiffness of the knee wrap. ||International Journal of Sports Science|2014|Willy Andrade Gomes, Érica Paes Serpa, Enrico Gori Soares, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Daniel Corrêa, Fernando Henrique Domingues de Oliveira, Francisco de Abreu Neto, Gustavo Martins, Guanis de Barros Vilela Junior, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||4|2||47-49||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AiH-uZ7U-co4C%26tzom%3D420

A compreensão de como o exercício de alongamento afeta a UMT auxilia os profissionais a aplicar corretamente está técnica. O objetivo foi revisar a literatura científica sobre os efeitos mecânicos na UMT após sessões agudas de alongamento. O tecido biológico da UMT apresenta diferentes propriedades viscoelásticas que podem ser afetadas com a aplicação de exercícios de alongamento. Portanto, principal efeito mecânico do alongamento estático agudo é a diminuição da tensão passiva da UMT, o que leva a uma maior ADM da articulação e a diminuição do pico de tensão da musculatura, provavelmente devido a … ||Revista CPAQV-Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida-CPAQV Journal|2014|Erica Paes Serpa, Guanis de Barros Vilela Junior, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||6|1||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ATFP_iSt0sucC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Efeito agudo dos exercícios de flexibilidade no desempenho de força máxima e resistência de força de membros inferiores e superiores||Este estudo verificou o efeito agudo dos exercícios de flexibilidade estática (EFlex) no desempenho de força máxima (FM) e de resistência de força (RF) em membros inferiores e superiores. Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2012|Anderson Caetano Paulo, Carlos Ugrinowitsch, Gerson dos Santos Leite, Gisela Arsa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Valmor Alberto Augusto Tricoli|Universidade Estadual Paulista|||18|2||345-355||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AMXK_kJrjxJIC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Muscle Activation Differs between Three Different Knee Joint-Angle Positions during a Maximal Isometric Back Squat Exercise||The purpose of this study was to compare muscle activation of the lower limb muscles when performing a maximal isometric back squat exercise over three different positions. Fifteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men performed an isometric back squat at three knee joint angles (20°, 90°, and 140°) in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activation of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), and gluteus maximus (GM). In general, muscle activity was the highest at 90° for the three quadriceps muscles, yet differences in muscle activation between knee angles were muscle specific. Activity of the GM was significantly greater at 20° and 90° compared to 140°. The BF and ST displayed similar activation at all joint angles. In conclusion, knee position alters muscles activation of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles. An isometric back squat at 90° generates the highest overall muscle activation, yet an isometric back squat at 140° generates the lowest overall muscle activation of the VL and GM only. ||Journal of Sports Medicine|2016|P.H.

Twenty-one physical active participants were evaluated during this study. The back squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric back squat contractions in 4 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with spiral knee wrap technique (SKW), with X knee wrap technique (XKW) and tensor (T). The peak force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was evaluated after each trial and condition. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions SKW vs WKW (P= 0.044, ES= 0.55, Δ%= 10.8%), and XKW vs WKW (P= 0.009, ES= 0.62, Δ%= 13.6%).

Paulo Marchetti ||The Effects of Uni-and Bilateral Fatigue on Postural and Power Tasks||The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of unilateral and bilateral fatigue on both postural and power bipedal tasks. Ten healthy subjects performed two tasks: bipedal quiet standing and a maximal bipedal counter-movement jumping before and after unilateral (with either the dominant or nondominant lower limb) and bilateral (with both lower limbs) fatigue. We employed two force plates (one under each lower limb) to measure the ground reaction forces and center of pressure produced by subjects during the tasks. To quantify the postural sway during quiet standing, we calculated the resultant center of pressure (COP) speed and COP area of sway, as well as the mean weight distribution between lower limbs. To quantify the performance during the countermovement jumping, we calculated the jump height and the peak force of each lower limb. We observed that both unilateral and bilateral fatigue … ||Journal of Applied Biomechanics 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc|2013|Paulo H Marchetti, Maria IV Orselli, Marcos Duarte|Human Kinetics, Inc|||29|1||44-48||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AroLk4NBRz8UC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle during low-intensity and fatiguing tasks||In order to understand the potential selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: the curl up (supine trunk raise) and the leg raise (supine bent leg raise) at low intensity (in which only a few motor units are recruited). In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a certain force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the lower and upper portions of the rectus abdominis muscle during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG intensities of the upper and lower portions during the curl up exercise was significantly larger than during the leg raise exercise (p= 0.02).

Paulo Marchetti ||Effect of Resistance Training Frequency on Neuromuscular Performance and Muscle Morphology after Eight Weeks in Trained Men.||The purpose of this study was to investigate the chronic effects of training muscle groups 1 day per week vs. 2 days per week on neuromuscular performance and morphological adaptations in trained men with the number of sets per muscle group equated between conditions. Participants were randomly assigned in 2 experimental groups: 1 session· wk per muscle group (G1, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained once a week with 16 sets or 2 sessions· wk per muscle group (G2, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained twice a week with 8 sets per session. All other variables were held constant over the 8-week study period. No significant difference between conditions for maximal strength in the back squat or bench press, muscle thickness in the elbow extensors, elbow flexors, or quadriceps femoris, and muscle endurance in the back squat and bench press performed at 60% 1RM was detected. Effect size favored G2 for some outcome measurements, suggesting the potential of a slight benefit to the higher training frequency. In conclusion, both G1 and G2 significantly enhance neuromuscular adaptations, with a similar change noted between experimental conditions. ||Journal of strength and conditioning research|2019|Felipe Alves Brigatto, Tiago Volpi Braz, TCDC Zanini, Moisés Diego Germano, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Brad Jon Schoenfeld, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Charles Ricardo Lopes|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A5awf1xo2G04C%26tzom%3D420

Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21, 9±3, 4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4, 6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p< 0,005) no período preparatório (13, 71±1, 30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14, 68±1, 51) e competitivo II (14, 63±1, 22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p< 0,005) no período competitivo II (3, 59±0, 30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3, 80±0, 36) e competitivo I (3, 86±0, 26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p< 0,001) no período competitivo II (1, 18±0, 43) em comparação com o preparatório (2, 50±2, 01) e competitivo I (2, 10±1, 61).

Paulo Marchetti ||Alongamento passivo agudo não afeta a atividade muscular máxima dos ísquiotibiais||The acute stretching may influence the force production in different tasks and sports performances. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of acute passive stretch on the electrical activity of the biceps femoris (BF) and hamstring muscle (HS) strength. Fourteen young adults, sedentary took part of this study. The subjects were asked to produce the maximal isometric contractions before and after a passive stretching protocol. The stretching protocol consisted of three attempts at 60 seconds and resting 15 seconds between each attempt. The subjects were analyzed using the following techniques: maximal isometric force (MIF), integrated electromyography (IEMG) and median frequency (Fmed) of the EMG signal of the BF before and after stretching. We performed the MIF, IEMG and Fmed of the EMG signal under these conditions and compared using a paired Student t test. The MIF of the biceps femoris (14.1 ± 4.9 e 13.1 ± 4.5 Kgf, respectively, p = .12), IEMG (208.4 ± 89.9 e 189.3 ± 75 V.s, respectively, p = .059), and FMed (22.7 ± 4 e 23.4 ± 5.5 Hz, respectively, p = .52) showed no significant differences between conditions before and after stretching. The acute effects of passive stretching did not significantly influence the pattern of electrical activation of the BF and the maximal isometric force produced by the HS. ||Motricidade|2012/12|AS Bley, PS Nardi, PH Marchetti|Revista Motricidade/Edições Desafio Singular|||8|4||80-86||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A4TOpqqG69KYC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Influence of unilateral fatigue of lower limbs on the bilateral vertical jump||It is common to observe bilateral strength deficit during the vertical jump. This is characterized by lower strength produced during bilateral contractions, when compared to the sum of the unilateral contractions of similar muscles. There is not much scientific knowledge about the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral deficit performance during bipedal vertical jump. Ten sedentary young adults unilaterally fatigued each lower limb and performed vertical jumps (bipedal and unipedal). We measured the vertical ground reaction force and myoelectrical activity to each lower limb and conditions (pre-fatigue, fatigue of the dominant limb (FD) and non dominant limb (FND)) were measured. Differences between tasks and conditions only on the pre-fatigue (p=0.030) were observed. Differences were observed for the bipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p=0.005), and unipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p<0.001) and FND (p<0.001). We only observed change on the performance of bipedal vertical jump during the FD condition. We observed a trend to the asymmetry index decrease for the muscular action of the fatigued contralateral lower limb by electromyography. The results suggest that there is a common command where the nervous system considers the muscles simultaneously activated as a unit, except in conditions of unilateral lower limb fatigue. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2011/12|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||17|6||405-408||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AUeHWp8X0CEIC%26tzom%3D420

O objetivo do estudo foi verificar o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre o rendimento e o déficit bilateral durante saltos verticais bipedais. Dez adultos jovens sedentários fatigaram unilateralmente cada membro inferior e realizaram saltos verticais (bipedal e unipedal). Foram medidas a força de reação do solo vertical e a atividade mioelétrica de cada membro em cada condição (pré-fadiga, fadiga do membro dominante (FD) e não dominante (FND)). Houve diferença entre tarefas e condições apenas na pré-fadiga (p= 0,030). Verificaram-se diferenças para o salto bipedal entre a condição de pré-fadiga e FD (p= 0,005), e no salto unipedal, entre a pré-fadiga e FD (p< 0,001) e FND (p< 0,001). Apenas durante a condição de FD houve alteração no desempenho dos saltos bipedais, tendo maior influência no desempenho dos saltos. Observou-se tendência de diminuição do índice de assimetria para a ação muscular do membro contralateral fatigado, observado através de eletromiografia. Através dos dados sugere-se que exista um comando comum onde o sistema nervoso considere os músculos ativados simultaneamente como uma unidade, exceto em condições de fadiga unilateral. ||Rev. bras. med. esporte|2011|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida||||17|6||405-408||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AkNdYIx-mwKoC%26tzom%3D420

However, little is known about its effect on multiple sets of strength training. Objective: To determine the effect of an extensive stretching protocol on the performance of multiple sets and soreness in strength training. Methods: The sample was composed by 12 trained-men, experienced in strength training. The protocol consisted of three sessions. The first session was used as a familiarization and load determination to 10 maximum repetitions (T10RM). The second and third conditions were randomized between subjects, and the bench press exercise (BP) was evaluated without previous stretching protocol (SEMA), and with previous stretching protocol (COMA). The stretching protocol consisted of six sets of 45 sec of stretch with 15 sec of resting intervals to the pectoralis major muscle. The stretching intensity was kept between 70 and 90% of the subjective point of discomfort. The local soreness was evaluated before and after exercise by a brief stretching and palpation. The Analysis of Variance ANOVA (2x6) was used to compare the maximum number of repetitions. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the load of the first set of each condition (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). The Student t-test was used to compare the total load and soreness. Results: A decrease on maximum number of repetitions along the sets was observed in both conditions, without differences between them, for the load of the first set, total load and soreness. Conclusion: The number of repetitions in multiple sets was reduced in the same magnitude in the conditions with … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015|Charles Ricardo Lopes, Enrico Gori Soares, A.L.R.

Paulo Marchetti ||Efeito da ordem dos exercícios no treinamento de força||Diversos estudos demonstram que a ordem de execução dos exercícios influenciam a performance neuromuscular em uma sessão de treinamento, e conseqüentemente as suas respostas ao treinamento. O objetivo do presente estudo foi revisar a literatura científica quanto aos efeitos da ordem dos exercícios na performance neuromuscular durante o treinamento de força. Observa-se que o efeito da ordem dos exercícios durante uma sessão de treinamento pode influenciar a performance neuromuscular quando realizados no início da sessão de treinamento quando comparada à sua realização ao final da sessão de treino. A percepção subjetiva de esforço parece não ser afetada pela ordem de execução dos exercícios e o sistema nervoso central parece alterar o padrão de recrutamento dos músculos em exercícios multiarticulares quando precedidos por um exercício monoarticular, aparentemente aumentando a solicitação dos músculos sinérgicos. Intervalos de recuperação maiores parecem afetar menos a performance neuromuscular quando comparados à intervalos menores, independente da sequência dos exercícios. ||Revista CPAQV-Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|2013|Enrico Gori Soares, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||5|3||1-14||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AR3hNpaxXUhUC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício agachamento||Actually the strength training has been widely used in different contexts and for different purposes: athletic, recreational, esthetic and therapeutic. Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions imposed on the squat exercise may result in changes in the action of muscles, kinematics and kinetic, and consequently increasing or decreasing their performance and/or efficiency. ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida–ISSN|2013|Paulo H Marchetti||||5|2||2013||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AhC7cP41nSMkC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Differences in muscular performance between practitioners and non practitioners of Parkour||The aim of this study was to investigate the strength and power performance of Parkour practitioners and compare to those who do not. Eleven male Parkour practitioners and 12 male physical educators participated in this study and performed: pull-up test, handgrip strength dynamometer test (HSDT), p lyo metric push-up test, maximal horizontal ju mp, and maximal bipodal and unipodal countermovement jumps (CMJ). We calculated limb asymmetry for HSDT and CMJs and the bilateral deficit for CMJs. Significant differences were found between groups for the pull-up test (P= 0.002), plyometric push-up test (P= 0.039), bipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), dominant unipodal CMJ (P= 0.008), nondominant unipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), maximal horizontal jump (P< 0.001), and bilateral deficit (P< 0.004).

Paulo Marchetti ||Investigações sobre o controle motor e postural nas assimetrias em membros inferiores||Durante diferentes atividades cotidianas ou esportivas o ser humano é submetido a desafios unilaterais que podem estar relacionados à performance de uma tarefa específica ou a própria manutenção de sua postura. Portanto, é natural o desenvolvimento motor de um membro em relação ao outro para tarefas específicas, desde que estas sejam repetidas de forma não simétrica. Desta forma, pode-se supor que sujeitos que possuam maiores estresses físicos unilaterais apresentem maior probabilidade em desenvolver assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas. O presente trabalho apresenta três diferentes experimentos visando investigar as assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas relacionadas ao controle de movimento para tarefas dinâmicas e estáticas em diferentes condições e grupos. O primeiro experimento visou investigar as diferenças, entre os membros inferiores, no controle de movimento entre sedentários e atletas, utilizando para isto a postura ereta quieta e o salto com contra-movimento nas condições bipedais e unipedais. O segundo experimento visou investigar o efeito da fadiga neuromuscular unilateral e bilateral no controle de movimento, entre membros, durante o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta bipedal. O terceiro experimento objetivou investigar o efeito prolongado da temporada esportiva no controle de movimento, entre membros, de atletas, utilizando o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta nas condições unipedal e bipedal. Inicialmente, o presente trabalho concluiu que não parece existir relação entre as diferenças antropométricas e funcionais.

Paulo Marchetti ||Effect of eccentric velocity on muscle damage markers after bench press exercise in resistance-trained men.||Aim. The purpose of this study was to determine how the execution velocity of eccentric exercises affects postexercise muscle damage in resistance-trained males using free-weight exercises. Methods. Twenty young males were divided by maximum eccentric strength into two groups: slow eccentric velocity (SEV, N.= 10) and fast eccentric velocity (FEV, N.= 10). Both groups performed four sets of eight repetitions with 70% of their one repetition maximum eccentric in a bench press exercise with a 2-minute rest interval between sets. Each group lifted an equal total volume load. The eccentric velocity was controlled to 3 seconds for the SEV group and 0.5 seconds for the FEV group. The 1RM test, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and creatine kinase (CK) activity were evaluated before and up to 96 hours postexercise. Results. A significant reduction (compared with baseline values) in 1RM test was observed up to 48 hours postexercise for the FEV group, while a significant reduction for the SEV group was only observed at 24 hours. The FEV group had a significant increase in DOMS up to 72 hours postexercise while the SEV group experienced an increase lasting up to 48 hours. The serum CK activity increased significantly only at 72 hours postexercise for both groups. There were no significant differences for any of the indirect analyses of muscle damage when the values were compared between groups. Conclusion.

Paulo Marchetti ||Comparison of the Postural Control Performance of Collegiate Basketball Players and Nonathletes||Athletes who play basketball are at risk for ankle injuries. Whether athletes demonstrate different postural stability and limb asymmetry during a quiet standing task compared with nonathletes is unknown. Fifteen collegiate basketball players and 15 nonathletes performed 3 trials of bipedal quiet standing for 30 s with 60 s of rest. Postural stability measures were obtained for each limb: integration of the resultant of the center of pressure (COP) speed (anteroposterior [AP] and mediolateral [ML] directions); COP area; and frequency (AP and ML). An asymmetry index between lower limbs was calculated for COP speed (AP and ML), COP area, and weight distribution. Basketball players demonstrated less COP speed (ML)(P=. 039), decreased levels of asymmetry for COP speed (P=. 033), and reduced COP area (P=. 005) and COP speed in the ML direction, compared with nonathletes.

OBJETIVO: Este estudo teve como objetivo investigar o efeito de um protocolo de alongamento por facilitação neuromuscular proprioceptiva de contração-relaxamento sobre o equilíbrio dinâmico. MÉTODOS: Vinte jovens saudáveis do sexo masculino realizaram duas sessões oredenadas aleatoriamente; uma sessão com protocolo de alongamento por facilitação neuromuscular proprioceptiva de contração-relaxamento, e uma sessão sem esse protocolo. O equilíbrio dinâmico bipedal foi medido nas direções ântero-posterior e médio-lateral antes e após a conclusão das duas sessões experimentais, com os olhos abertos e fechados. RESULTADOS: O estudo mostrou que não há diferença significativa entre as duas sessões (com vs sem o protocolo de alongamento) no sentido ântero-posterior. No entanto, na direção médio-lateral, o protocolo de alongamento aumentou significativamente o equilíbrio dinâmico, quando comparado com a condição de protocolo sem alongamento.

Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of light-emitting diodes on muscle fatigue and exercise tolerance in patients with COPD: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial||Light-emitting diodes (LED) have been used to minimize muscle fatigue in athletes and healthy subjects. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible to early muscle fatigue. The objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of LED on muscle function, exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory responses during isometric and dynamic exercise in patients with COPD. This study will assess 30 patients with moderate to severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume-one second,FEV1 ≤70% predicted). Isometric and dynamic protocols will be conducted in two visits each, for a total of four visits a week apart. First, venous blood will be taken from the patients. The isometric protocol will start with the determination of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MIVC) to determine the workload (60% of MIVC) for the isometric endurance test (IET). Patients will be randomized to receive either the placebo or LED application (each point will be irradiated for 30 s and the energy received at each point will be 41.7 J). Immediately after finishing this procedure, the patients will carry out the IET until the limit of tolerance or until a 20% fall of strength is observed. After the test, another blood draw will be taken. In another visit (one week later), the same order of procedures will be performed, except with the opposite (LED or placebo). For the dynamic endurance test (DET), the same procedures described above will be followed, except with 75% of the maximal workload obtained from the incremental cycle ergometer test used instead of the IET.

Paulo Marchetti ||Acute Effects of Stretching Routines with and without Rest Intervals between Sets in the Bounce Drop Jump Performance||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of static-stretching (SS) session with (intermittent) and without (continuous) rest intervals between sets on the bounce drop jump performance, with the same volume and intensity. The experimental protocol consisted of (1) a brief warm-up using sub-maximal jumps;(2) a pre-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for each lower limb);(3) ankle plantar flexors SS protocol (intermittent or continuous) was used only for a single-lower limb;(4) immediate post-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for the stretched lower limb). Then, subjects rest for 30 minutes and the topics 3-4 were repeated with the other lower limb and stretching protocol. The intensity used for both stretching protocols was between 70-90% of the point of discomfort. There were significant decrease in jumping height performance for both stretching protocols: continuous (P= 0.001) and intermittent (P= 0.006). There were significant increase in contact time only for the continuous protocol (P= 0.025). Our findings indicated that both stretching protocols (intermittent or continuous) were effective to increase the passive ankle ROM, and to decrease the single-leg jump height, however only the continuous SS protocol showed increases in the contact time. ||International Journal of Sports Science|2015|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Enrico Gori Soares, Fernando Henrique Domingues Oliveira Silva, Priscyla Silva Monteiro Nardi, Érica Paes Serpa, Willy Andrade Gomes, Brad J.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a full sport season on the postural control of team handball elite athletes. Ten healthy, elite male team handball players performed bipodal standing (BP) and right and left unipodal standing (UP) during 30s. We used the RMS and speed of the center of pressure to describe postural sway. For the BP task, the sway was lower at the end of the season (p<0.005). For the UP tasks, the sway was lower at the end of the season only for the non-dominant limb (p<0.001). Differences between limbs were observed only at the end of the season (p<0.03). In conclusion, a full team handball season did not lead to deterioration of the athletes' postural control, but by the end of the season, the athletes were more asymmetrical. ||Motriz|2014|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Maria Isabel Veras Orselli, Lúcio M.

High resistance-training frequency enhances muscle thickness in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res XX (X): 000–000, 2018—The purpose of this study was to compare the effect a split training routine with muscle groups trained once per week (SPLIT) vs. whole-body split training routine with muscle groups trained 5 days per week (TOTAL) on neuromuscular adaptations in well-trained men. Eighteen healthy men (height= 177.8 6 6.6 cm; total body mass= 84.4 6 8.1 kg; age= 26.4 6 4.6 years) were recruited to participate in this study. The experimental groups were matched according to baseline strength and then randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 experimental groups: SPLIT (n= 9) or TOTAL (n= 9). Prestudy and poststudy testing included 1RM for bench press, parallel back-squat and machine close-grip seated row, as well as an ultrasound analysis of the muscle thickness (MT) of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and vastus lateralis. After 8 weeks of training, no significant difference between groups was noted for all 1RM tests (p. 0.05 AU2). TOTAL induced a significantly greater increase in MT of the forearm flexors and vastus lateralis (p, 0.05). In conclusion, muscle strength increment is similar regardless of the experimental conditions studied; however, TOTAL may confer a potentially superior hypertrophic effect. ||The Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research|2019|Rafael S Zaroni, Felipe A Brigatto, Brad J Schoenfeld, Tiago V Braz, Júlio C Benvenutti, Moisés D Germano, Paulo H Marchetti, Marcelo S Aoki, Charles R Lopes|LWW||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AUHK10RUVsp4C%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||The effect of different resistance training load schemes on strength and body composition in trained men.||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of moderate-load (10 RM) and low-load (20 RM) resistance training schemes on maximal strength and body composition. Sixteen resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a moderate-load group (n= 8) or a low-load group (n= 8). The resistance training schemes consisted of 8 exercises performed 4 times per week for 6 weeks. In order to equate the number of repetitions performed by each group, the moderate load group performed 6 sets of 10 RM, while the low load group performed 3 sets of 20 RM. Between-group differences were evaluated using a 2-way ANOVA and independent t-tests. There was no difference in the weekly total load lifted (sets× reps× kg) between the 2 groups. Both groups equally improved maximal strength and measures of body composition after 6 weeks of resistance training, with no significant between-group … ||Jounal of Human Kinetics|2017|C.R.

Paulo Marchetti ||Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício pulley||Muitos são os exercícios utilizados para o desenvolvimento dos músculos que envolvem os membros superiores (particularmente o latíssimo do dorso, peitoral maior, redondo maior, deltóide parte espinal e bíceps braquial). Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos do exercício pulley que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino como o deslocamento da barra em relação ao tronco, os diferentes tipos de pegada (supinada e pronada) e as variações no comprimento da pegada na barra. O entendimento destas variações técnicas do exercício pulley podem influenciar a correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício pulley e suas variações. Poucos são os estudos que analisam as variações na técnica do exercício pulley, mas puderam ser observadas que diferentes alterações mecânicas realizadas podem acarretar em mudanças na ação dos músculos envolvidos neste exercício, aumentando ou diminuindo a performance e/ou sua eficiência. ||Revista de Atenção à Saúde (antiga Rev.

Este estudo investigou o efeito da aplicação ou não da massagem na remoção da fadiga em 12 sujeitos saudáveis. Os resultados mostraram que a massagem, como intervenção, parece ser uma forma efetiva de remoção da fadiga comparada ao repouso entre as séries no treinamento de força. ||ConScientiae Saúde|2006|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marcelo Gonçalves|Universidade Nove de Julho||||5||35-38||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Ad1gkVwhDpl0C%26tzom%3D420

Objetivo: Comparar o efeito do intervalo de alongamento estático de forma continua e intermitente no desempenho de flexores de punho. Métodos: A amostra foi composta por 14 adultos jovens, hígidos, do gênero masculino (idade 31±9 anos; estatura 178±0,7 cm; massa 85±12 Kg). Foi avaliada a amplitude de movimento passivo (ADMP) em extensão de punho, a força isométrica máxima de flexão de punho associado a eletromiografia superficial antes e depois de dois protocolos de alongamento com diferentes intervalos entre séries. Para cada sujeito, um dos membros superiores foi alongado com o protocolo contínuo (CON) e o outro com o intermitente (INT), de forma aleatória. O protocolo CON consistiu na realização do alongamento durante 6 minutos ininterruptos, e o INT consistiu na realização de seis séries de 1 minuto por 20 segundos de intervalo entre as séries. A intensidade foi mantida a 70-90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Resultados: Os resultados de ADMP mostraram aumento significante entre as condições pré e pós-intervenção, em ambos os protocolos INT (81°±10 e 94°±10, P<0,001) e CON (87°±12 e 96°±11, P=0,004).

Paulo Marchetti ||Variáveis objetivas e subjetivas para monitoramento de diferentes ciclos de temporada em jogadores de basquete||O presente estudo teve o objetivo de avaliar, comparar e relacionar carga e cansaço causado por treinamento durante um ciclo de periodização em jogadores de basquete. Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21,9 ± 3,4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4,6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p < 0,005) no período preparatório (13,71 ± 1,30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14,68 ± 1,51) e competitivo II (14,63 ± 1,22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p < 0,005) no período competitivo II (3,59 ± 0,30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3,80 ± 0,36) e competitivo I (3,86 ± 0,26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p < 0,001) no período competitivo II (1,18 ± 0,43) em comparação com o preparatório (2,50 ± 2,01) e competitivo I (2,10 ± 1,61). Os resultados revelaram a efetividade na monitoração da carga e cansaço dos atletas através do método proposto para auxiliar na organização do treinamento durante um macrociclo. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2012/8/1|Gerson dos Santos Leite, Jonato Prestes, Christiano Bertoldo Urtado, Paulo H Marchetti, Carlos Roberto Padovani, Carlos Roberto Pereira Padovani, Maria Regina Ferreira Brandão, João Paulo Borin|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ACHSYGLWDkRkC%26tzom%3D420

A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2012/6|Anderson Caetano Paulo, Carlos Ugrinowitsch, Gerson dos Santos Leite, Gisela Arsa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Valmor Tricoli|Motriz: revista de educação física (Online)|||18|2||345-355||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ALkGwnXOMwfcC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Desempenho dos membros inferiores após reconstrução do ligamento cruzado anterior||O desempenho dos membros inferiores em tarefas dinâmicas pode auxiliar no entendimento do controle motor em indivíduos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA. Os objetivos do presente estudo foram investigar o déficit bilateral e a simetria entre os membros inferiores de sujeitos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA e comparar com sujeitos não lesionados. Vinte adultos jovens foram divididos em dois grupos (LCA e controle). A tarefa consistiu na execução do exercício Leg Press (unilateral direita e esquerda e bilateral). O número de repetições máximas (RM) foi quantificado e então o déficit bilateral e o índice de assimetria foram calculados. Os resultados mostraram assimetria no número de RM realizada entre membros no grupo LCA (p= 0,005) e apenas o grupo controle apresentou déficit bilateral (p= 0,004). Conclui-se que indivíduos que realizaram a reconstrução do LCA apresentaram assimetrias entre membros, sem a presença de déficit bilateral. ||Motriz rev educ fís|2012|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Eduardo Garcia Bucchianico, Tatiane Amore, Priscyla Silva Monteiro Nardi, Júlio Cesar Gali, Marco Carlos Uchida||||18|3||441-8||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AzYLM7Y9cAGgC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Balance and lower limb muscle activation between in-line and traditional lunge exercises.||In-line and traditional lunge exercises present differences in technique as lower limb positioning (anterioposterior), and medio-lateral (ML) balance may differentially affect primary and stabilizer muscles. The purposes of this study were to examine ML balance and muscle activation in anterior and posterior leg positions between in-line and traditional lunge exercises. Fifteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men (25±5 years) performed 2 different lunge exercises (in-line and traditional) at their 10 repetition maximum in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography measured muscle activation of the vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, and gluteus medius. ML balance was measured with a Wii Fit Balance Board. The vastus lateralis activity was not significantly different between exercises or leg positions. The biceps femoris activity was not significantly different between exercises … ||Journal of Human Kinetics|2018|P.H. MARCHETTI, M.A. GUISELINI, J.J. DA SILVA, R. TUCKER, D.G. BEHM, L.E.

Paulo Marchetti ||Static stretching of the pectoralis major decreases triceps brachii activation during a maximal isometric bench press||BACKGROUND: Static stretching (SS) not only increases the range of motion (ROM) of the stretched muscle but can also enhance the ROM of homonymous and heteronymous contralateral muscles. Whereas prolonged SS can lead to performance impairments of the stretched muscle, deficits in muscle activation have not been investigated with non-stretched muscles that contribute to a task such as a bench press. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged SS of the pectoralis major muscle on the synergic activation of the pectoralis major (PM) and triceps brachii (TB) muscle during an isometric bench press action. METHODS: Fourteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men had their shoulder complex passively stretched (horizontal abduction) with six stretches of 45-s each, with 15-s rest between each stretch at an intensity of 70-90% of the point of discomfort.

Paulo Marchetti ||La Respuesta Morfológica y de Rendimiento en el Entrenamiento de Pilates en Mujeres Activas-Ciencias del Ejercicio||El propósito de este estudio fue investigar la activación muscular y la fatiga después del entrenamiento de Pilates de alto volumen y las implicaciones agudas en el rendimiento de la fuerza y las respuestas morfológicas relacionadas con el tejido muscular de los miembros inferiores. Doce mujeres jóvenes sanas y entrenadas realizaron una sesión de Pilates con una Silla Wunda. En dos momentos distintos (pre y post-intervención), se registraron las imágenes de resonancia magnética (RM) ponderadas por el tiempo de relajación transversal (T2) y las evaluaciones isocinéticas de las extremidades inferiores. Hubo aumentos significativos en la intensidad de la señal T2 post-intervención en el glúteo mayor y en toda la porción muscular (proximal, medial y distal) del vasto lateral y del recto femoral. Hubo disminuciones significativas en: el rendimiento de pre a post-intervención en el pico de torque, el trabajo total y la potencia media del momento de extensión. Sin embargo, en el momento de la flexión, no hubo diferencias significativas en el rendimiento entre la pre-y la post-intervención. Los resultados confirman que el método Pilates, cuando se aplica con el control de variables tales como series de tiempo, repeticiones e intervalos de descanso, promueve una modificación de la fuerza muscular y el volumen de los grupos musculares afectados. La capacidad de manipular variables de entrenamiento cuando se aplica al aparato de Pilates promueve cambios agudos similares como se informó en estudios de entrenamiento de fuerza. ||PubliCE|2017|Ticiane Marcondes Fonseca da Cruz, Fernando de Oliveira Rosa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Natalia Mariana Silva Luna, Thiago Antonio Fedele, Julia Maria D’Andrea Greve, Marcelo Bordalo Rodrigues, Rozangela Verlengia, Charles Ricardo Lopes|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AeMMeJKvmdy0C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||EFEITOS AGUDOS E ADAPTAÇÕES NEUROMUSCULARES DECORRENTE DA MANIPULAÇÃO DE VOLUME E DENSIDADE NO TREINAMENTO DE FORÇA||A manipulação do volume e da densidade no treinamento de força é realizada através do gerenciamento do número de séries realizadas em cada grupamento muscular e como essas séries são alocadas na sessão e na semana de treinamento. A manipulação dessas variáveis altera as respostas agudas e as adaptações crônicas no sistema neuromuscular. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi revisar os efeitos agudos e adaptações neuromusculares decorrentes da manipulação diária e semanal do volume e densidade no treinamento de força. A combinação da ordem dos exercícios, sistemas de treinamentos e séries realizadas tem demonstrado ser uma estratégia eficiente para aumentar o desempenho e reduzir o tempo da sessão de treinamento. Estudos prévios sugerem que o aumento da sobrecarga pode ser realizado através da manipulação das séries na sessão do treinamento e do número de sessões ao longo da semana. Quanto à frequência de treinamento, a literatura parece ser clara ao sugerir ganhos superiores de força e hipertrofia muscular quando duas a três sessões por grupamento muscular são realizadas na semana. Entretanto, frequências de até 6 sessões na semana para o mesmo grupo muscular podem favorecer o anabolismo muscular. A presente revisão conclui que em uma única sessão de treinamento até 30 séries por grupo muscular podem ser necessárias dependendo do objetivo e da população treinada. O desempenho agudo da sessão (volume absoluto, força e potência) pode ser melhorado por meio de diferentes ordens de exercícios ou sistemas de treinamento quando essas estratégias … ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|2017|Enrico Gori Soares, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||9|2||2||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Aolpn-zPbct0C%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||INTERMITTENT AND CONTINUOUS STRETCHING INCREASE RANGE OF MOTION AND DECREASE FORCE ON WRIST FLEXORS||Objetivo: Comparar o efeito do intervalo de alongamento estático de forma continua e intermitente no desempenho de flexores de punho. Métodos A amostra foi composta por 14 adultos jovens, hígidos, do gênero masculino (idade 31±9 anos; estatura 178±0, 7 cm; massa 85±12 Kg). Foi avaliada a amplitude de movimento passivo (ADMP) em extensão de punho, a força isométrica máxima de flexão de punho associado a eletromiografia superficial antes e depois de dois protocolos de alongamento com diferentes intervalos entre séries. Para cada sujeito, um dos membros superiores foi alongado com o protocolo contínuo (CON) e o outro com o intermitente (INT), de forma aleatória. O protocolo CON consistiu na realização do alongamento durante 6 minutos ininterruptos, e o INT consistiu na realização de seis séries de 1 minuto por 20 segundos de intervalo entre as séries. A intensidade foi mantida a 70-90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Resultados Os resultados de ADMP mostraram aumento significante entre as condições pré e pós-intervenção, em ambos os protocolos INT (81±10 e 94±10, P< 0,001) e CON (87±12 e 96±11, P= 0,004).

Paulo Marchetti ||Acute effects on performance of the vertical jump after back squat with knee wraps||INTRODUCTION: Knee wraps can affect the muscular performance during high-intensity exercises by reducing muscle activation, which may influence the effect of post-activation potentiation, which depends on high intensity for the following power exercise. Objective: To investigate the acute effects on the performance with counter-movement jump (CMJ) after high-intensity squat with and without the use of knee wraps in resistance trained subjects. METHODS: The study included 14 men (aged 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, weight: 81±11kg, 1RM: 107±30kgf) resistance trained (>3 years). Three SCM were performed before and after three back squats at 90% of 1RM with and without the knee wraps. During the CMJ muscle activation (IEMG) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), jump time (JT), and impulse (IMP) through the force of vertical ground reaction (FRSV) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results show statistically significant differences for JT between post-back-squat conditions (with and without wrap) (P=0.044, TE=1.02), whereas the highest values were observed without knee wrap. For IEMG of VL significant difference between pre and post-conditions after back squat (with knee wrap) (P=0.029, TE=1.68) was observed, and the highest values were observed for the IEMG with knee wrap. No significant differences between conditions were observed for IEMG of GM and IMP. CONCLUSION: After using the knee wraps during the squat exercise, there was a reduction in the involvement of the vastus lateralis during the jump with counter-movement, affecting the contact time, but not the production of impulse and consequent … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015/8|Willy Andrade Gomes, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Enrico Gori Soares, Erica Paes Serpa, Daniel Alves Corrêa, Vilela Junior, Guanis de Barros, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||21|4||257-260||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AnrtMV_XWKgEC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of passive stretching protocol on multiple sets performance in resistance training||OBJETIVO: Determinar o efeito do alongamento passivo extensivo no desempenho de séries múltiplas e da dor percebida no treinamento de força. MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta de 12 homens experientes com treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira serviu como familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos, sendo uma realizada com a avaliação do supino reto (SR) sem alongamento prévio (SEMA), e a outra com alongamento prévio (COMA). O protocolo de alongamento consistiu de seis séries de 45 seg de alongamento por 15 seg de intervalo visando o músculo peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após o exercício, a dor local foi avaliada por meio de breve alongamento e palpação. A Análise de Variância ANOVA (2x6) com medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar a carga da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). O teste-t de Student foi utilizado para comparar a carga total com a dor. RESULTADOS: Observou-se decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições, sem diferenças entre as mesmas, para a carga da primeira série, a carga total e a dor. CONCLUSÃO: O número de repetições em séries múltiplas é diminuído na mesma magnitude com e sem a realização do alongamento prévio, além de não alterar a carga total e a dor percebida. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2015/6|Charles Ricardo Lopes, Enrico Gori Soares, André Luis Rodrigues Santos, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||21|3||224-229||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AcFHS6HbyZ2cC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Maximum number of repetitions performed by resistance-trained men: Effect of maximum load intensity and exercise selection||The purpose of this study was to compare the number of maximum repetitions (RMs) performed at 80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) and 80% of one-repetition maximum eccentric (1RMecc) test for the preacher-curl (PC) and the bench-press (BP) exercises. Fifteen resistance-trained men participated in this counterbalanced-crossover study. There was no significant difference in the number of RMs performed at 80%-1RM (PC: 7.0±1.2 RMs and BP: 5.8±1.3 RMs) and 80%-1RMecc (PC: 6.0±1.1 RMs and BP: 5.4±1.1 RMs) for both exercises. No significant difference in the numbers of RMs was detected between the PC (80%-1RM: 7.0±1.2 RMs and 80%-1RMecc: 6.0±1.1 RMs) and BP exercises (80%-1RM: 5.8±1.3 RMs and 80%-1RMecc: 5.4±1.1 RMs) for both intensities. In conclusion, the number of RMs performed by resistance-trained men was not affected by the maximum load intensity based on muscle action and the exercise selection. ||Motriz: Revista de Educação Física|2014/6|Charles R Lopes, Alex H Crisp, Rozangela Verlengia, Cesar A Macarrone, Dyego A Peghim, Gustavo R Mota, Marcelo S Aoki, Paulo H Marchetti|Motriz: revista de educação física (Online)|||20|2||221-225||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AM3NEmzRMIkIC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Os efeitos da suplementação de creatina na performance de corredores velocistas (100 e 200 metros)||O uso da creatina enquanto recurso ergogênico para atletas visando o ganho de massa muscular e aprimoramento da performance, vem sendo difundido no meio esportivo. As provas que envolvem força e potência no atletismo (corridas de velocidade, saltos, arremesso e lançamentos) são modalidades onde o uso desse recurso ergogênico é muito requisitado. Diversas pesquisas acerca da suplementação de creatina estão sendo realizadas e por mais que alguns estudos mostrem resultados que apontem para uma efetividade do produto na melhora de capacidades físicas de atletas, principalmente força e potência, outros trabalhos ainda não validam tal método, portanto o presente estudo teve como objetivo comparar os resultados dos testes, de velocidade (30 metros), Sprint de 100 metros e corrida de 40 segundos, realizados por dois grupo de seis atletas de elite nacional (18 a 25 anos) praticantes das provas de corrida de velocidade (100 e 200 metros), submetidos a um mesociclo (3 semanas) de treinamento específico, acompanhado de um programa de suplementação, no qual um grupo realizou a ingestão de creatina, sendo administrada 20g/dia divididos em 4 doses de 5g durante a primeira semana (5 dias), seguido por uma fase de manutenção de 3g/dia na segunda e terceira semana (10 dias). E o outro grupo seguiu o mesmo protocolo de suplementação, porém teve a creatina substituída por placebo. A pesquisa mostrou melhora significativa do grupo creatina na performance dos sprints de 100 metros quando comparado ao grupo placebo.

Paulo Marchetti ||Investigações sobre o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome||O músculo reto do abdome é um importante músculo da parede abdominal, responsável pela estabilização e função da coluna, tanto em atividades atléticas quanto em atividades cotidianas. Entretanto, pouco se conhece sobre o controle neuromotor de tal estrutura em atividades voluntárias, como os exercícios abdominais, e como as diferentes tarefas agem na ativação segmentada das porções musculares do músculo reto do abdome. Em geral, a presente dissertação teve como objetivo investigar o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome em diferentes tarefas voluntárias através de quatro experimentos. O primeiro experimento teve como objetivo descrever as características morfológicas do músculo reto do abdome, em particular sua área de secção transversa, ao longo do comprimento longitudinal do músculo, utilizando as imagens do projeto homem visível (NLM). O segundo experimento objetivou o mapeamento dos pontos motores para cada porção muscular. O terceiro experimento investigou o controle neuromotor das diversas porções musculares em tarefas isométricas de baixa intensidade. E por fim, o quarto experimento investigou o comportamento das porções musculares em diferentes tarefas isométricas em condição de fadiga neuromuscular. Baseado nos experimentos apresentados neste estudo pode-se concluir que o músculo reto do abdome é uma estrutura extremamente complexa em sua arquitetura, sendo caracterizada por diversas porções musculares que se interconectam através de aponeuroses tendíneas, onde, possivelmente nenhuma fibra muscular atravesse seus ventres.

Paulo Marchetti ||Identification of muscle fatigue by tracking facial expressions.||Resistance training (RT) is performed at distinct levels of intensity from the beginning to the end of exercise sets, increasing the sensation of effort as the exercise progress to more vigorous levels, commonly leading to changes on the facial expression of RT practitioners. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and the activation of facial muscles by surface electromyography(sEMG) at two different levels of effort during resistance exercise and to investigate the correlation between facial expression and exercise intensity and fatigue. Eleven healthy male participants [23±6years; 1.77±6 m; 78±10kg] performed a set of arm curl exercise at 50% and 85% 1RM until muscle fatigue. The Surface electromyography (sEMG activity was recorded simultaneously in areas of the epicranius muscle (EM) and zygomatic major muscle (ZM). Facial expression was recorded and blindly scored by five experienced examiners. Scores (0–5) were based on the level of activity of the ZM (lip corner puller—Action Unit 12-FACS) during exercise. Facial expression and sEMG data were obtained during the exercise at the first repetition and at muscle failure. The root mean square (RMS) of the sEMG amplitude of the EM was significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.75; and 85%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.54).

Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of elastic wrap on muscle activation and isometric force of knee extensor.||Introduction: The elastic knee wrap (EKW) is a device used by powerlifters, weightlifters and subjects undergoing strength training with the aim of stabilizing the knee joint and increasing the development of strength (carryover effect). Objective: To compare the effects of elastic knee wrap use on muscular activity of the vastus lateralis (VL) and on knee extension force during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) on the knee extensor chair. Methods: The study included 18 healthy male strength trained (>1 year) subjects (age: 25.56 ± 4.84 years, total body mass: 81.83 ± 8.73 kg, height: 176 cm ± 5.17). Three five-second maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the knee extensors were performed with a 10-second interval between attempts, for each experimental condition: control (C), with elastic knee wrap (EKW), and with tensor (T). The performance of the knee extensors and VL muscle activity were evaluated. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the dependent variables (carryover, peak force, IEMG and Impulse). Results: For carryover, the use of EKW presented a higher value (74.21%) than the control condition (p <0.001, d = 0.96) and was 79.37% higher than the tensor (p <0.001, d = 0.97). Peak force was 12.2% higher in condition C compared to EKW (p = .018, d = 0.71). For impulse, the control condition presented an increase of 8% compared to EKW use (p = .015, d = 0.62). No significant differences were observed for IEMG. Conclusion: Elastic knee wrap use increased strength production capacity during knee extension. The removal of the mechanical effect originating from carryover during MVIC … ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte.|2018|F. S. FREITAS, W.A. GOMES, MARCHETTI.

Paulo Marchetti ||Elbow wrap improves bench press performance in trained subjects.||Introduction: The elastic wrap is widely used by different types of athletes and recreational practitioners of strength training in order to improve weightlifting performance. Objective: The objective was to investigate the acute effects of elbow wrap on strength performance, absolute volume, and rating of perceived exertion/discomfort during the bench press (BP) exercise. Methods: The experimental protocol was divided into three laboratory sessions. At the first session, a bench press familiarization phase was performed with (EW) and without (WEW) elastic elbow wrap. During the second session, the 1RM test was carried out in the bench press exercise under both EW and WEW conditions. At the third session, the repetition maximum (RM) test at 70% of 1RM (EW and WEW) was performed until concentric failure. After each session, subjects were consulted about their rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and discomfort (PSD). A paired student t-test was used to compare the values of 1RM and RMs with and without elastic wraps. Descriptive analysis was used for RPE and PSD. Results: For the 1RM test, there was a significant increase for the EW condition when compared to WEW (p<0.05). In the RMs test and absolute volume calculation, there was a significant increase for the EW condition (p<0.05). RPE did not differ in any of the conditions tested (p>0.05). PSD presented a high degree of discomfort with elastic wraps in all conditions. Conclusion: Elastic elbow wraps increase the load lifted in the 1RM test, and the maximum number of repetitions during the BP exercise, and consequently, the absolute volume.

Paulo Marchetti ||Different load distributions affect acute neuromuscular responses and muscle thickness in resistance-trained men.||The aim of the present study was to compare acute neuromuscular responses and muscle thickness of a resistance training session with continuous-vs. grouped-sets. The experimental procedures were performed across three sessions in a crossover and random fashion. During the first session, all subjects were familiarized and the 10RM load was determined for both exercises: biceps curl (BC) and triceps extension (TE). The following two sessions were randomized for continuous-or grouped-sets. For continuous-sets, 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise (BC and TE) were performed sequentially, while for grouped-sets, each exercise was alternated every 4 sets until 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise were completed. Two minutes of rest was used between sets and exercises. Volume load and muscle thickness (biceps brachii, MTBB, and triceps brachii, MTTB) were measured pre-and post-exercise. Peak force and myoelectric activity (iEMG) were measured for each exercise (BC and TE) and each muscle (biceps brachii and triceps brachii) during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction test. Results demonstrated that volume load was significantly greater in grouped-sets for both exercises (P< 0.001). MTBB and MTTB increased after both sessions (P< 0.001), however, there was a greater effect with continuous-sets when compared to grouped-sets (P= 0.001). Peak force decreased for both exercises and sets (P< 0.05). iEMG decreased only after continuous-sets for both muscles (P< 0.001).

Methods: Ten healthy young men (age: 23±6.5 years; total body mass: 82.8±10.6 kg, height: 177.3±0.1 cm) randomly performed 3 resistance exercise sessions with different rest intervals between sets (30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds). The resistance exercise sessions consisted of 6 full-body exercises (bench press; seated low row; shoulder press; back squat; leg press 45 and seated calf raise) performed with 4 sets of 10 repetitions maximum (RM). Total load lifted (sets× repetitions× load (Kgf)) and lactate blood concentration were determined for each exercise session. One way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test were used for multiple comparisons. Results: The total load lifted was significantly (P< 0.001) lower for 30 seconds (26382.0±4100.3 kg) rest interval compared with 60 seconds (28864.5±4139.7 kg) and 120 seconds (30064.4±3966.4 kg).

Paulo Marchetti ||Landing techniques affect performance and mechanical stress during Drop Jump||Introduction: The drop jump is used to improve the power of the lower limbs. Keeping the drop height constant, the variation of the landing technique can modify the performance and the mechanical characteristics of the jump. Objective: To evaluate the effects of different landing techniques on the performance and the reaction force of the vertical component of the ground after drop jump. Methods: Twenty-five healthy and physically active men (age: 26±8 years, total body mass: 75±10 kg, height: 175±10 cm) performed four landing techniques after the drop jump: bounce drop jump (BDJ), drop jump with 90° of knee flexion (DJ90), drop jump with 135° of knee flexion (DJ135), and drop jump with 135° of knee flexion with hands resting on the ground (DJ135A). Three attempts were performed for each technique; the subjects performed the drop jump falling from a 40 cm high force platform. The measures of jump height, contact time and impact were determined by the force of reaction of the vertical component of the ground, measured by the force platform, at a frequency of acquisition of 2,000 Hz. The repeated measures by ANOVA were used to compare the different techniques. Results: The BDJ technique presented lower jump height, shorter contact time and greater impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). The DJ90 technique presented jump height similar to the DJ135 and DJ135A techniques and a short contact time (P<0.001) and a lower impact than the other techniques (P<0.001).

Paulo Marchetti ||Acute effects of maximal isometric muscle action of the elbow extensors on contralateral dynamic task of the elbow flexors: a pilot study||Aim the aim was to investigate the influence of a maximal isometric muscle action of the elbow extensors on the contralateral dynamic task of the elbow flexors. Methods Seventeen recreationally trained men (23.3 ± 4.9 yrs, BMI: 24.8 ± 2.2 Kg/m²) underwent two randomized different testing sessions separated by one week. In the control session (CON) all subjects performed a maximum number of repetitions test (RMs) at 75%1RM using the right elbow flexors. The experimental session (EXP) was similar to the CON; however, all subjects were instructed to perform RMs at 75%1RM by using the right elbow flexors and maintaining the maximal voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors during the test. RMs, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and training volume (TV) were measured and compared between sessions. Results The EXP showed a significant 10.4% increase on the RMs (13.8 vs. 12.5, p < 0.001, d = 0.44) and 12.1% increase in TV (238.0 vs. 212.4 kg, p < 0.001, d = 0.43) than CON. No differences were observed for RPE between sessions. Conclusion The maximum voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors increased the RMs of the contralateral elbow flexors, reflecting a higher TV, and no differences in the RPE. Our results suggest that the investigated method may be a viable and practical alternative to increase the acute strength performance of elbow flexors when using submaximal loads. ||Motriz|2017|C.V.L.S.

Paulo Marchetti ||Effects of Squat Amplitude On Pelvic Tilt and Tibial Inclination||Strength training is commonly performed at two different knee flexion amplitudes: partial (to 90 degrees) or total (to 140 degrees). During these amplitudes, both the pelvis and the tibia are moved to ensure control of the center of gravity and displacement of the external overload. Forward or backward movement of the pelvic tilt may indirectly influence the internal load on the spine. Objective: To measure the effect of squat amplitude on pelvictilt and tibia inclination. Eighteen male subjects (age: 26±6 years, height: 178±7 cm, total body mass: 81.3±11 kg, resistance training experience: 5±4 years) were evaluated. Pelvic tilt and tibial inclination were measured by a digital inclinometer (Max Measure, USA, accuracy:±0.02, resolution: 0.05) during isometric squatting at partial and full amplitudes. The digital inclinometer was fixed on the sacrum and on the tibia, with aneutral spine position. A paired student t-test and a significance of 5% were used. There were significant differences in pelvic tilt between partial and full amplitudes (+ 32.4±10.9 and-21.7±12.3, respectively, P< 0.001). Maximum tibial inclination values were not significantly different between partial and total amplitudes (19.1±6.6 and 20.1±7.4, respectively, P= 0.225). It was concluded that the partial squat position produces anterior pelvic tilt while the full squat produces backward pelvic tilt.

Paulo Marchetti ||Técnicas de aterrissagem afetam o desempenho e estresse mecânico durante drop jump. (Landing techniques affect the performance and mechanical stress during drop jump).||Strength training is commonly performed at two different knee flexion amplitudes: partial (to 90 degrees) or total (to 140 degrees). During these amplitudes, both the pelvis and the tibia are moved to ensure control of the center of gravity and displacement of the external overload. Forward or backward movement of the pelvic tilt may indirectly influence the internal load on the spine. Objective: To measure the effect of squat amplitude on pelvictilt and tibia inclination. Eighteen male subjects (age: 26±6 years, height: 178±7 cm, total body mass: 81.3±11 kg, resistance training experience: 5±4 years) were evaluated. Pelvic tilt and tibial inclination were measured by a digital inclinometer (Max Measure, USA, accuracy:±0.02, resolution: 0.05) during isometric squatting at partial and full amplitudes. The digital inclinometer was fixed on the sacrum and on the tibia, with aneutral spine position. A paired student t-test and a significance of 5% were used. There were significant differences in pelvic tilt between partial and full amplitudes (+ 32.4±10.9 and-21.7±12.3, respectively, P< 0.001). Maximum tibial inclination values were not significantly different between partial and total amplitudes (19.1±6.6 and 20.1±7.4, respectively, P= 0.225). It was concluded that the partial squat position produces anterior pelvic tilt while the full squat produces backward pelvic tilt. Inclination of the tibia is similar in both amplitudes of the squat. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2017|P.H. MARCHETTI, T.T. DOS SANTOS, E.G. SOARES, E.P. SERPA, J.J. DA SILVA, G.B.

Paulo Marchetti ||PERFIL ANTROPOMÉTRICO E FUNCIONAL DOS VELEJADORES NO CAMPEONATO BRASILEIRO DE VELA ADAPTADA||Objetivo: Descrever o perfil antropométrico e funcional dos velejadores que participaram do Campeonato Brasileiro de Vela Adaptada. Métodos: Participaram 19 atletas de vela adaptada, do sexo masculino, com idade entre 23 e 56 anos. Todos os dados dos participantes do campeonato foram descritos com as seguintes medidas antropométricas de peso corporal, estatura, estatura sentada, comprimento e alcance dos membros superiores e inferiores, diâmetros ósseos, circunferências, dobras cutâneas e funcional da força de preensão manual. Resultados: Em função de a literatura científica ser escassa quanto ao perfil antropométrico e funcional dos velejadores da vela adaptada nas classes 2.4 mR tripulado por um atleta e o J24 tripulado por três, tornou-se impossível comparar os resultados obtidos neste estudo, em todas variáveis antropométricas e funcional. Conclusões: Esse perfil apresentado será utilizado em estudos futuros com um numero maior de variáveis e avaliação de desempenho em condição especifica da modalidade, com o objetivo de aprofundar as características físicas e funcionais ideais desses atletas. ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|2016|Fábio Barreto Maia da Silva, Leandro Mendes da Silveira, Débora Ávila Barbosa, Roger Gomes Tavares Mello, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti||||8|2||2||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A8AbLer7MMksC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Effect of strength training on the motor performance of the triathlon athletes during the season||The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of a strength training program on physical performance. Fourteen athletes, male, participants from national competitions of triathlon. The training was developed in 24 sessions of resistance training for 12 weeks, and adaptation phase lasted 08 sessions, using 60% to 65% of one repetition maximum. The specific phase consisted of 16 sessions using 65% to 80% of 1RM. Subjects were subdivided in the experimental group and control group, where experimental group has conducted strength training and the control group did not. Performance evaluations were carried out in three different moments: 1. before starting the strength training, 2. after four weeks of strength training and 3. after 12 weeks of resistance training. We used a repeated measures ANOVA (2 x) to the% Fat, lean body mass, swimming test of 400m, maximum oxygen consumption, maximum power, mean power, index of fatigue with Sidak’s post hoc, and 5% of significance. We concluded that the strength training influenced positively the time of 400 m of the swimming, the maximum power and the average of the power in triathletes after a periodized training program for 12 weeks. ||Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|2015|Luiz Antonio Domingues Filho, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Alexandre Lopes Evangelista, Gustavo Ribeiro da Mota, Willy Andrade Gomes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Ídico Luis Pelegrinotti||||7|2||2||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AzA6iFVUQeVQC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||The effect of different stretching times on single-leg jump performance||INTRODUCTION: Stretching is very common as part of the warm-up in several sports modalities. However this practice can be negative to strength improvement and muscular power. Consequently, jump performance can be reduced after stretching exercises, depending on its duration and intensity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effects of different long-term stretching times on single-leg drop jump performance. METHODS: The sample was composed of 16 healthy jump experienced young adult athletes. The experimental protocol consisted of performing three maximum unipodal drop jumps from a 15 cm high platform, and landing on a contact mat (Hidrofit(r)), before and after two stretching times of the triceps surae muscles (i.e. a series of 3 minutes on one side and 6 minutes on the other, with the sides being randomly chosen), using an intensity of 70-90% of their subjective perception of discomfort. An ANOVA (2x2) analysis was used to verify differences for the jump height, contact time and flexibility, using a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between pre and post-stretching times of 3 and 6 minutes (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Contact time was higher only for the stretching time of 6 minutes (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: We conclude that stretching exercises of the triceps surae muscle, for 3 or 6 minutes, resulted in a decreased performance in the single-leg drop jump, a decrease in the vertical jump height (for 3 and 6 minutes) and contact time (for 6 minutes only), reinforcing the need for more debates in this area regarding stretching before power activities. ||Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|2014/6|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Enrico Gori Soares, Fernando Henrique Domingues Oliveira Silva, Iris Ilza de Medeiros, Ilídio dos Reis Neto, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Marco Carlos Uchida, Reury Frank Bacurau|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|||20|3||223-236||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AblknAaTinKkC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Propulsion Phase of the Single Leg Triple Hop Test in Women with||Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF … |||2014|AS Bley, JCF Correa, ACD Reis, NDDA Rabelo, PH Marchetti|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AbnK-pcrLprsC%26tzom%3D420

Paulo Marchetti ||Upper and lower limbs muscle in patients with COPD: Similar muscle efficiency but differences in resistance to fatigue||Background: It is still controversy whether the impairment of muscle function is homogeneous between the upper and lower limbs in patients with COPD. Objective: To compare muscle function between quadriceps femoris (QF) and middle deltoid (MD) after a fatigue protocol and also the recovery time fatigue. Methods: Twenty-one patients (VEF1: 46±10% predicted) performed for both muscles: maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) pre and post 10, 30, 60min and 24h after completing an isometric endurance test (IET, 60%MVIC). All measurements were made with surface electromyograpy (sEMG) recording. For the temporal analysis the amplitude of the sEMG signals was expressed as root mean square (RMS, 1-s moving window), normalized by MVIC and then, the RMS EMG was integrated (iEMG). For the time-frequency analysis, EMG data were analyzed with a FFT applied to 1-s epochs and the … |||2011/9/1|Eduardo Foschini Miranda, Carla Malaguti, Paulo Marchetti, Simone Dal Corso|European Respiratory Society|||38|Suppl 55||p1256||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3Ar0BpntZqJG4C%26tzom%3D420

METHODS: 9 male boxing athletes (18, 8±1, 75 years old) were submitted to 4 identical (structure and volume) training sessions (TS) as follows:(A) jump rope, punching drills, hanging bag (1 movement per sec);(B) jump rope, punching drills, hanging bag (3 movements per sec). These sessions were considered as low (A) and high (B) intensity and each of them was repeated twice. To determine the ITL, we used the Rating Perceived Exertion (0-10) after 30'post training, and the indicated number was multiplied by TS volume (Foster et al., 2001). BLC was checked before and after TS using Accutrend Lactate (Roche). Lactate concentration was compared between high and low trainings using the Wilcoxon statistic test.

METHODS: Ten healthy adult (mean age: 26±8years) performed isometric curl-up (supine trunk raise with feet free) and leg-raise (supine bent-leg raise) exercises. In order to understand the potential selective activation of the RA, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: curl up and leg raise at low-intensity. In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the EMG activities of the lower and upper portions of the RA during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. RESULTS: At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG … ||Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise|2011/5/1|Paulo H Marchetti, Andre F Kohn, Marcos Duarte|LWW|||43|5||495||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AeQOLeE2rZwMC%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||Atividade mioelétrica máxima dos músculos vasto medial oblíquo e vasto lateral em cadeia cinética aberta e fechada.||Introdução: O alinhamento patelar, por parte dos estabilizadores dinâmicos, está diretamente relacionado ao equilíbrio na atividade muscular do Vasto Medial Oblíquo (VMO) e Vasto Lateral (VL). Alterações anatômicas e biomecânicas do membro inferior são comumente relacionadas com a etiologia da Síndrome da Dor Femoropatelar (SDFP). Estudos constataram que o controle neural não apropriado do quadríceps está relacionado a esta condição, principalmente quando a magnitude e o início da atividade mioéletrica do VMO leva desvantagem em relação ao VL. Objetivo: Avaliar a ativação eletromiográfica do VMO e VL, em contração isométrica voluntária máxima, em ângulos articulares específicos de 80 em cadeia cinética aberta (CCA) e de 30 em cadeia cinética fechada (CCF). Método: Participaram 12 voluntários (24±4 anos), sendo 9 homens. Foi realizado um estudo transversal aprovado pelo comitê de ética da Instituição. Incluídos apenas voluntários hígidos, sedentários, sem histórico de lesão ou cirurgia nos membros inferiores. Foram submetidos a aquisições eletromiográficas do VMO e VL, durante contração isométrica voluntária máxima do quadríceps em CCA a 80 e em CCF a 30. O sinal elétrico foi analisado através da atividade eletromiográfica integrada (IEMG) e então foram comparadas as tarefas (CCA e CCF) e músculos (VMO e VL) através de uma ANOVA (2x2). Resultados: Durante a CIVM, a IEMG dos músculos VMO e VL apresentaram diferenças significativas quando comparados entre tarefas (CCA e CCF)(p= 0, 02 e p= 0, 08, respectivamente), entretanto, não foram verificadas diferenças entre músculos para … ||Terapia Manual|2011|André Serra Bley, Diego Barbosa Fonseca, Marjori do Prado de los Santos, Adriano Rodrigues||||9|42||54-58||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A35N4QoGY0k4C%26tzom%3D420
Paulo Marchetti ||VALIDAÇÃO DO TAPETE DE CONTATO NA MENSURAÇÃO DA ALTURA DO SALTO EM JOGADORES DE BASQUETE DE ELITE VALIDITY OF CONTACT MAT FOR MEASURING JUMP HEIGHT IN ELITE BASKETBALL PLAYERS||O tapete de contato tem sido utilizado em diversos estudos e possui grande aplicação prática no treinamento e no controle esportivo. Embora a plataforma de força seja considerada o “padrão ouro” na avaliação da certas variáveis dos saltos verticais, ela requer um ambiente de laboratório, assim como um alto custo para aquisição e manutenção. Consequentemente, os testes realizados no tapete de contato constituem uma boa alternativa para a avaliação de atletas na condição esportiva, quando, muitas vezes, o acesso a um laboratório se torna impossível e inacessível. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente estudo foi mensurar os critérios de validade do tapete de contato (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0-Brazil), comparando-se tais cálculos com os resultados do “padrão ouro” na plataforma de força. Quinze atletas de basquetebol de elite, categoria sub-21, foram submetidos a três tentativas do SCM no tapete de salto (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0) e na plataforma de força (OR6-1000, AMTI). A altura do salto vertical foi calculada utilizando-se ambos os equipamentos. Os valores de média (±1DP) para a altura do SCM, medidos pela plataforma de força, foram 32.3±5.1 cm e, para o tapete de contato, foram 32.44. 5cm. O teste t de Student pareado não apresentou diferenças significantes entre ambas as formas de mensuração (p= 0.90). O gráfico de Bland-Altman foi construído para fornecer uma interpretação visual aos dados. Portanto, o presente estudo sugere que os SCMs avaliados no tapete de contato apresentam confiáveis e consistentes medidas para a definição da altura de salto comparadas às obtidas por meio de plataformas de força, e que … ||Revista de Atenção à Saúde (antiga Rev.

Paulo Marchetti ||The effect of dominant first dorsal interosseous fatigue on the force production of||Crossover and non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) has generally focused on large muscle groups. It is unclear whether fatigue of a small muscle can result in NLMF of a larger muscle. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of small muscle (first dorsal interosseous; FDI) fatigue on the force and activation of contralateral homologous and larger heterologous muscles (biceps brachii, BB). Fifteen right-handed, male subjects performed three pre-test index finger abduction or elbow flexion maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) on the non-dominant side. Subsequently, they performed two 100s index finger abduction MVICs on the dominant side (experimental [fatigue] group) or rested for 5 minutes (control group). Afterwards, a single MVIC and a 12 repetition MVIC fatiguing protocol were completed with index finger abduction or elbow flexion on the non-dominant side. Force and electromyography (EMG) were measured from both sides. The force and EMG (median frequency: MDF) of nonexercised index finger abductors (IFA)/FDI and elbow flexors (EF)/BB significantly decreased after the fatiguing protocol. Compared with the control condition, the non-exercised IFA (12.5% and 5.7%) had significantly greater force and MDF fatigue indexes than the EF (5.2% and 1.7%). ||||Yimeng Li, Kevin E Power, Paulo H Marchetti, David G Behm|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3AEkHepimYqZsC%26tzom%3D420

Entretanto, pouco é sabido sobre seu efeito ao longo de séries consecutivas no treinamento de força. Objetivo: Determinar o efeito do alongamento extensivo no desempenho de séries múltiplas no treinamento de força. Métodos: A amostra foi composta de 12 adultos jovens, experientes com o treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira delas serviu de familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos. A primeira delas avaliou a realização do supino reto sem alongamento prévio (SEMA). A segunda delas avaliou a realização do supino reto com alongamento prévio (COMA). O alongamento consistiu de 6 séries de 45” de alongamento com 15” de intervalo para o peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após ambas as condições foi avaliada a dor local por meio de um alongamento breve e palpação. Uma ANOVA (2x6) de medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar o load da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). Teste t de student foi utilizado para comparar o load total e a dor.

The experiment was performed in two sessions. During the first session, the maximal BS strength (1RM) was evaluated (without KW), followed by a familiarization with the use of KW. In the session two, all subjects performed 1 set of 3 repetitions (self-selected cadence) under 4 different conditions in a random order: with KW and without KW (NW) at 60% and 90% 1RM. A rest period (10 minutes) was used between conditions. The descent phase was parallel to the ground (~ 90º of knee joint flexion). The spiral wrapping technique was used. For the muscle activation evaluation, the superficial electromyography (sEMG) technique was used on vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), only in a dominant lower limb. The IEMG was calculated from the sEMG data (normalized by maximum voluntary isometric contraction, MVIC) during each trial. A repeatedmeasured ANOVA was used for all dependent variables ((wraps x intensity). Post hoc comparisons were performed with the Bonferroni’s test. An alpha of 0.05 was used. ||||Willy A Gomes, Lee E Brown, Enrico G Soares, Josinaldo J Silva, Érica P Serpa, Daniel A Correa, Guanis B Vilela Junior, Charles R Lopes, Paulo H Marchetti|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3ASdhP9T11ey4C%26tzom%3D420

Normalmente, indivíduos treinados realizam entre 20 e 25 series para cada grupo muscular em uma única sessão. Adicionalmente a prática do treinamento de força, a fim aumentar a amplitude de movimento, a realização de alongamento passivo é frequente entre os praticantes. Entretanto, a literatura científica demonstra que a realização de alongamento passivo extensivo tem sido relacionada a um déficit no desempenho de atividades forca-dependentes (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011). os possíveis mecanismos responsáveis pela redução da força após a realização do alongamento são:(i) a inibição dos estímulos excitatórios do motoneurônios alfa, via estimulação das terminações nervosas III, IV e órgão tendinoso de golgi,(ii) aumento do atraso eletromecânico devido a maior complacência da unidade musculo-tendínea,(iii) alteração na relação comprimento--tensão da unidade musculo-tendínea, e (iv) isquemia local devido ao menor fluxo sanguíneo e acumulo de metabolitos (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011; Marchetti, oliveira Silva et al., 2014).

However, in ML direction, the CR PNF stretching protocol enhanced significantly (p< 0.05) dynamic balance when compared with no stretching protocol. This study suggested that CR PNF stretching might be effective to improve dynamic balance control. ||||Amine Ghram, Mohamed Damak, Fatma Rhibi, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UoynbjMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D100%26pagesize%3D100%26citation_for_view%3DUoynbjMAAAAJ%3A5Ul4iDaHHb8C%26tzom%3D420
Justin Nicoll ||Muscular strength and power in 3-to 7-year-old children||To determine absolute and relative (adjusted for body mass) strength, mean power, and mean velocity for upper and lower body resistance exercises, forty-seven young boys and girls participated in maximal strength testing. Healthy young boys and girls, ages 3- to 7-years old, were tested for one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength, and 70% of 1-RM to determine mean power and mean velocity on the chest press and leg press exercises. Adult weight machines were modified to accommodate the smaller size and lower strength levels of the children. A 2 × 4 (sex × age) ANOVA was used to determine age and sex differences in performance. No interaction or sex differences were observed for any variable at any age. 1-RM strength, mean power, and mean velocity significantly increased across ages (p ≤ .05). When adjusted for body mass, the changes were insignificant, with one exception.

Justin Nicoll ||Changes in resting mitogen-activated protein kinases following resistance exercise overreaching and overtraining||Purpose Many physiological maladaptations persist after overreaching and overtraining resistance exercise (RE). However, no studies have investigated changes in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) after overtraining in humans, despite their critical role regulating exercise-induced muscular adaptations. The purpose of this study was to describe the changes in total and resting phosphorylation status of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38-MAPK following a period of RE overreaching or overtraining. Methods Following 2–4 weeks of normal training (low volume/low intensity), two groups of males performed either a high-power overreaching protocol (HPOR n = 6, mean ± SD, age 23 ± 3.4 years, mass 86.5 ± 17.7 kg, height 1.77 ± 0.06 m) or high-intensity overtraining protocol (HIOT n = 8 … ||European journal of applied physiology|2016/12/1|Justin X Nicoll, Andrew C Fry, Andrew J Galpin, Adam J Sterczala, Donald B Thomason, Christopher A Moore, Lawrence W Weiss, Loren ZF Chiu|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|||116|11-12||2401-2413||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RO3uaZcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%3AUeHWp8X0CEIC%26tzom%3D420

Effects of circadian rhythm on power, force, and hormonal response in young men. J Strength Cond Res 30 (3): 725–732, 2016—Circadian rhythms (CRs) persist in many physiological systems related to performance. The effects of circadian patterns on dynamic muscular power are minimal and conflicting. Furthermore, no study to date has investigated the effect of CR on bench press throws (BPTs) despite its popularity as a modality to increase muscular power.

Justin Nicoll ||Resting extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 expression following a continuum of chronic resistance exercise training paradigms||Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) moderates skeletal muscle growth; however, chronic responses of this protein to unique resistance exercise (RE) paradigms are yet to be explored. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the long-term response of ERK1/2 following circuit weight training (CWT), recreationally weight training (WT), powerlifting (PL) and weightlifting (WL). Independent t-tests were used to determine differences in trained groups compared to sedentary controls. Total ERK1/2 content was lower in PL and WL compared to their controls (p ≤ 0.05). Specific trained groups displayed large (WL: pERK/total-ERK; d = 1.25) and moderate (CWT: total ERK1/2; d = 0.54) effect sizes for altered kinase expression compared to controls. The results indicate ERK1/2 expression is down-regulated after chronic RE in well-trained weightlifters and powerlifters.

Justin Nicoll ||Thyroid hormones, performance, and psychological changes on overtraining in female distance runners||Statement of the Problem: Overtraining (OT) is common in endurance sports. Perturbations in the hormonal milieu are common throughout OT literature. Thyroid hormones (TH) are altered by energy imbalances, and these imbalances are often present in female endurance athletes. Thyroid hormones also regulate metabolism, energy production, and therefore they may play a role in commonly cited symptoms of OT in these athletes. Alterations in TH status often occur slowly, and research investigating TH and their relationship in overtrained athletes is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships in TH and commonly cited symptoms of OT in collegiate track and field (T&F) endurance runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field middle (MD; n= 9; age: 20.21±1.49 yrs; height: 167.86±5.04 cm; body mass: 57.97±5.05 kg; VO 2MAX: 53.62±6.04 ml/kg/min) and long (LD; n= 7; age: 20.47±1.53 yrs; height: 162.48±6.11 cm; body mass: 56.15±5.99 kg; VO 2MAX: 61.94±3.29 ml/kg/min) distance runners participated in a 14 week descriptive study. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4), were collected at the beginning of the indoor T&F (PRE) and end of the outdoor T&F season (POST). Dietary intake and vertical jump power (VJP) were tested at PRE, MID, and POST season.

Eleven men performed unilateral elbow-extensor AE (~45 min at 70% peak workload) followed by unilateral RE (4×7 maximal repetitions) for both arms. Thus, one arm performed AE+RE interspersed by 15 min recovery, whereas the other arm conducted RE alone. Muscle biopsies were taken from the triceps brachii of each arm immediately before (PRE), 15 min (POST1) and 3h (POST2) after RE. Molecular markers involved in translation initiation, protein breakdown, mechanosignaling and ribosome biogenesis, were analysed. Peak power during RE was reduced by 24% (±19%) when preceded by AE (P<0.05).

Justin Nicoll ||MAPK Signaling and Intracellular Hormone Receptor Phosphorylation at Rest and Following Resistance Training||Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, JNK, and p38 are a family of signal transduction proteins that respond to diverse forms of physiological stress including exercise. MAPK appear to mediate several adaptations to exercise skeletal muscle however most of their data are limited to cell culture, animal or endurance training study designs. Increasing evidence suggests they mediate translational efficiency and capacity. Further, recent data indicates they can regulate the steroid androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors via phosphorylation. However, there are no data investigating AR and GR phosphorylation in humans or their response to resistance exercise (RE). Thus, understanding how MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation respond during resistance exercise will give us better insight to their specific roles in muscle adaptation. This dissertation investigated the activation of MAPK and epinephrine receptor signaling to a caffeine containing pre-workout supplement during resistance exercise. Further, we also described MAPK expression and phosphorylated AR and GR in resting skeletal muscle between males and females. Finally, we conducted a training study to determine differences in MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation following a period of stressful resistance training. The results of this dissertation indicates 1) pre-workout supplementation improves performance but does not enhance MAPK or epinephrine receptor signaling early after RE, 2) males and females express different expression of phosphorylated AR, GR, and p38 at rest, 3) MAPK and phosphorylated AR and GR are activated after acute RE and are … |||2018/5/31|Justin Nicoll|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RO3uaZcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%3AULOm3_A8WrAC%26tzom%3D420

Surface electromyography signals were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) during an isometric trapezoidal muscle action with the steady force plateau set at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The signals were decomposed to yield MUAP sizes and RTs for each MU. The AP slope was calculated via the MUAP sizes vs. RT relationships for MUs recruited between 10 and 50% MVC for each subject. Few MUs with RTs< 10% MVC were observed in young or old and, thus, these MUs were excluded from the slope calculation. FDI cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) were quantified using ultrasonography. Possible differences in AP slope, CSA and EI between groups were examined with independent samples t-tests.

Justin Nicoll ||Beta2-Adrenergic Sensitivity Prior to Training is Related to ERK MAPK Down-regulation Following Resistance Exercise Overtraining.||Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) basal excretion, and beta2-adrenergic (β2) receptor content are altered after overtraining (OT). Recent literature implicates β2 signaling in the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and phenotype. β2 signaling in skeletal muscle involves the signaling protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). To date, no study has investigated the E-β2-ERK signaling axis in OT humans. PURPOSE: To determine if basal sensitivity of epinephrine (E/β2) and norepinephrine (NE/β2) were related to changes in ERK activity following a period of resistance exercise OT. METHODS: Sixteen males were randomized into an overtraining group (OT: n= 8, age= 20.6±2.1 yrs, ht= 179±10cm, body mass= 78.6±12.1 kg) or control group (CON n= 8, age= 19.8±1.7 yrs, ht= 179±6cm, body mass= 76.7±9.7 kg). The OT group performed 10 X 1 at 100% 1 RM daily for 2 wks. CON performed normal training 2 days/wk. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle and nocturnal urinary E and NE were assessed before (pre) and after (post) overtraining. Biopsies were analyzed for total-ERK and ratio of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) via western blotting. The ratio of pERK was corrected for changes in total-ERK content between pre and post training. Multiple regression was used to determine if E/β2 and NE/β2 (independent variables) were significantly related to changes in pERK (dependent variable) after training. Significance was set at p<. 05. RESULTS: When groups were analyzed together, E/β2 and NE/β2 at pre explained 64% of variance in the change of pERK at post (F [2, 13]= 14.4, p=. 001, adj. R 2=. 641).

METHODS: Twenty-five healthy (age= 21.5±1.9 years), recreationally active men and women completed one familiarization and three experimental visits, a minimum of 48 hours apart. Each visit consisted of a brief, standardized warmup, two submaximal CMJs, and three maximal CMJs performed on a force plate (sample rate= 1000Hz). Each jump was separated by two minutes. To reduce the variability associated with arm swing, all jumps were performed with subjects’ hands on their hips. The CMJ GRF waveform for each jump, beginning with the minimum GRF during the counter-movement and ending at take off, was interpolated and re-sampled to a uniform length of 1000 data points.

A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant decreases in volume for both TRA (set 1: 1632.7±386.4 kg; set 2: 1190.0±209.2 kg; set 3: 930.1±172.4 kg) and APS (set 1: 1579.1±332.8 kg; set 2: 1172.0±269.6 kg; set 3: 909.1±232.4 kg) as the sets progressed through the exercise session (p<. 001). These decreases were similar between both methods (p=. 471). There was not a significant interaction of volume between the APS and TRA groups (p=. 772). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there were no differences in volume between TRA and APS resistance session. The APS training appears to be a time efficient alternative to TRA resistance training. |||2016|Justin X Nicoll, Adam J Sterczala, Andrew C Fry|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RO3uaZcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%3AaqlVkmm33-oC%26tzom%3D420

Justin Nicoll ||THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP, BURN OUT, AND PERFORMANCE IN COLLEGIATE FEMALE RUNNERS.||Overtraining (OT) frequently occurs in collegiate athletes. Currently, energy imbalance is considered the primary mechanisms responsible for OT. However, there is little research concerning potential early OT identifiers that coaches and athletes can easily monitor, such as sleep habits and daily fluctuations in fatigue. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between fatigue, sleep, perception of burn-out, and performance change over a track season in female collegiate runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field mid and long distance runners (age: 20.34±1.47 yrs; height: 165.17±6.08 cm; body mass: 57.06±5.44 kg; VO2MAX: 58.24±5.92 ml/kg/min) participated in a 14-week descriptive study. Sleep (latency, quality, disturbance, daytime dysfunction), burn-out (reduced accomplishment, emotional/physical exhaustion, devaluation), and fatigue surveys were measured pre-, mid-, and end of-season. Percent change in race time (season best vs. championship performance) was calculated and Spearman rank order correlations were run to assess possible relationships among the variables. Significance was set at p≤ 0.05. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between sleep latency and burn-out exhaustion pre-and mid-season (r= 0.555 and r= 0.558), sleep latency and performance mid-season (r=-. 729), and sleep related daytime dysfunction and all characteristics of burn-out end of-season (reduced accomplishment: r= 0.574; devaluement: r= 0.666; and exhaustion: r= 0.672).

Justin Nicoll ||Testing Modality is Vital to Determine Performance Changes in Overreaching Resistance Exercise||CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise performance decrements were similar to previous investigations (1, 3). However, only dynamic RE (barbell squat) was sensitive enough to detect decreased performance compared to isometric RE (knee extension) in overreached subjects. Similarly, it appears power and velocity are more adversely affected by OR than measures of maximal force. Immediate mechanisms are not clear why only dynamic exercise was impaired in this study. Decreases in performance in the barbell exercise may be due to the greater reliance on more elaborate systems of neuromuscular coordination and muscle activation. This may further be supported by the finding that components of muscle performance that required higher speed output (power and velocity) were decreased in the barbell exercise. Periodically assessing power and velocity on barbell squats at 70% of 1-RM might be a useful tool for strength and weightlifting coaches during various stages of periodized programs to assess the efficacy of the implemented overload period. ||||Justin Nicoll, Andrew C Fry, Loren ZF Chiu, Brian K Schilling|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RO3uaZcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DRO3uaZcAAAAJ%3A3fE2CSJIrl8C%26tzom%3D420

Stuart Pardau ||The ethical implications of cloud computing for lawyers||In late 2010 Australian mining and petroleum company BHP Billiton Ltd.(" Billiton") was working on a $38 billion deal for the acquisition of Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp.(" Potash") when hackers launched a cyber-attack against Toronto law firms involved in the transaction, including prominent" Bay Street" firms Blake Cassels & Graydon LLP (representing BHP Billiton) and Stikeman Elliott LLP (representing Royal Bank of Canada). 1 Billiton's acquisition of Potash would have made Billiton the world's foremost producer of potash, and some observers suspected that the Chinese government sponsored the attack to protect the interests of Sinochem Group, China's state-owned chemicals and fertilizer company. 2 The Billiton-Potash deal ultimately fell through, allegedly for other reasons, and the law firms involved insisted ||J.

Stuart Pardau ||The Ethical Implications of Cloud Computing for Lawyers, 31 J. Marshall J. Info. Tech. & Privacy L. 71 (2014)||This paper aims to isolate the pertinent ethical issues of cloud computing and chart a sensible path forward for lawyers. Part II briefly introduces the concept of cloud computing. Part III discusses the lawyer‟ s duties of confidentiality, of competence, to protect client property, and to oversee non-lawyers who are providing assistance. Part III also examines the application of these duties by the various state bar associations to the problem of cloud computing. Part IV looks at sample terms of use of some of the more popular vendors. Part V suggests that securing informed consent, employing specialty cloud providers, and purchasing cyber insurance provide more practical ways to ensure a lawyer doesn't run afoul of his ethical obligations. ||The John Marshall Journal of Information Technology & Privacy Law|2014|Stuart Pardau, Blake Edwards||||31|1||4||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kTVd2fMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DkTVd2fMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DkTVd2fMAAAAJ%3AqjMakFHDy7sC%26tzom%3D420
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||Flexibility of system of systems||In order to remain competitive, organizations have to make themselves accessible to a diversity of alternatives, which could be a direct influence on their flexibility; however, flexibility introduces a new context by which these organizations manage the systems they realize. In this paper, we present a theoretical perspective on the management of flexibility of a type of system called a System of Systems (SoS). We first define flexibility as it has been described with respect to the management of a system, how this may relate to SoS and establish that there is a deficiency for understanding how the SoS should be managed near the optimization region of flexibility. We then propose a theoretical model for managing flexibility in a SoS that begins to address this optimization region of flexibility. We demonstrate our model with an empirical case study of the New York City Yellow Cab SoS and conclude with potential … ||Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management|2008/10/1|Alex Gorod, S Jimmy Gandhi, Brian Sauser, John Boardman|Springer India|||9|4||21-31||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3Au-x6o8ySG0sC%26tzom%3D420

Previous literature shows that complexity theory is applicable to the unique structure of SEVs and the dual goals of creating economic and social value. We argue that not only are SEVs complex systems, but also operate as a SoS. As such, SEVs could greatly benefit from a general systemic risk management approach that is often applied to SoS. In order to explain our position, we consider an example of an existing SEV and apply these concepts to their operations. We also identify systemic risks in the example and show how the application of a systemic risk management approach can benefit SEVs. ||Entrepreneurship Research Journal|2016/1/1|Colleen Robb, S Jimmy Gandhi|De Gruyter|||6|1||111-133||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3A0EnyYjriUFMC%26tzom%3D420

The typology of systems based on flexibility is an example of such efforts in literature. However, more research on choosing effective styles for managing each category based on the right degree of freedom and level of control is required. In this paper, the spectrum of existing managerial approaches is described. Understanding available methodologies helps decision makers to select a more appropriate management style for the specific category of system. To do that, the four categories of systems based on flexibility are analyzed and mapped with the existing management styles, which are identified and described in this research. The proposed method can increase the overall effectiveness of management practices in the field of engineering management. The mapping approach proposed in this research can also decrease the complexity associated with management techniques in modern dynamic environment. |||2009/10/14|Mo Mansouri, Alex Gorod, Brian Sauser, S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AR3hNpaxXUhUC%26tzom%3D420

Career pathways generally consist of partnerships between K-12 school districts, community colleges, four-year universities and community-based workforce investment boards. The overall goal is to bridge the gap between industry-needed skills and those obtained through formal education. The expected outcome is the transition of students into industry after high school, transfer into a community college, or seek a four-year college degree. Regardless of the career pathway outcome, the WFD program inculcates hands-on, practical skills in participants. These skills were included based on industry feedback about the gap between current graduates’ skills and those expected in the field of practice. The skills were also echoed in the ‘Engineer of 2020’report by the National Academy of Engineering. As a result, the career pathways include programs and services that addresses aforementioned skill gap and increases the employability of students; particularly in the hightech industry.

And yet, considering the myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21st century and ever increasing consumer power, the risk of entrepreneurial activity has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner and fundamentally change the teaching methods, curriculum, and research in entrepreneurship education. Applying the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to entrepreneurship with similar rigor can increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. Still, faculty and administrators of engineering programs are hesitant to introduce courses into an engineering curriculum outside of engineering fundaments. The paradox, however, is that non-core engineering courses including leadership and engineering management can help students develop highly desired attributes that contribute to career and industry success. |||2014|MD Wilson, Eric Holloway, S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AWF5omc3nYNoC%26tzom%3D420

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||A comprehensive review of entrepreneurship course offering in engineering programs||Entrepreneurship education is becoming increasingly important in engineering schools. This is a trend that started several years ago in the US and is also spreading internationally. This trend appears to be due to the fact that engineers are responsible for providing solutions to enhance the quality of life for people worldwide and for facing the challenges related to that responsibility. As society develops we face new challenges, which call for varied and innovative approaches to solve these problems. This is further confirmed by the National Academy of Engineers’ book titled “The Engineer of 2020”, which the clearly discusses the changing role of the engineer in 2020 7. This process of evolving as a profession cannot be achieved unless an entrepreneurial mindset is created amongst the engineers of 2020 and beyond. To foster this entrepreneurial mindset, engineering programs are undertaking various initiatives. However, there is no clear agreement regarding the entrepreneurship content that should be included for engineers. ||Proceedings|2016|S Gandhi, MB Jimmy, S Taghazadeh|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3A4JMBOYKVnBMC%26tzom%3D420

In addition, movement of resources to achieve" higher productivity and greater yield" requires a" natural" understanding of the interrelationship between capital and labor. Application of such understanding to solve a particular human problem is often referred to as innovation. The entrepreneur is a business leader who looks for ideas and puts them into effect thereby fostering economic growth and development of a region. And entrepreneurship is one of the most important inputs for the economic development of a country … ||Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.|2014|S Jimmy Gandhi, MD Wilson, Dirk Hecht, Gunter Hofbauer, Tom Hope, Ramalatha Marimuthu, Akin Olufowoshe|American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM)||||||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AUebtZRa9Y70C%26tzom%3D420

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||Curriculum design for sustainability of globally integrated manufacturing||Integrating the scalable nanotechnologies into existing industrial systems is highly beneficial for improving the quality, capability and performance of almost all kinds of industrial sectors. However, significant sustainability issues and challenges exist in the practical integration and subsequent operations of the integrated macro-nano industrial systems, including increased waste generations, extra energy consumptions, additional greenhouse gas emissions, novel nanoparticle emissions for occupational and public exposure, etc. This paper will analyze which competence domains, a curriculum towards sustainable manufacturing should have and how a certificate program in “Sustainable Manufacturing” can be accomplished. This curriculum design is based on the experience of creating and teaching new graduate level courses “Sustainable Manufacturing” at Texas Tech University and “Energy Efficiency and Industrial Sustainability” at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. All segments of society must be educated to understand, environmental, economic and social connections within manufacturing systems engineering to facilitate sustainability. The innovations in technology and management play a fundamental role in solving the global challenge in economic development, while simultaneously preserving life, conserving natural resources and creation of social justice. This pilot study could be a pioneer for further countries in the world such as China, Indian, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which would be interested in implementing sustainable manufacturing. ||age|2015|Bingbing Li, S Jimmy Gandhi, Li Ding||||26|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3ATQgYirikUcIC%26tzom%3D420

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||DEVELOPMENT OF A TOOL TO EVALUATE INNOVATION PRACTICES AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT||Entrepreneurship is considered as important value adding tool for the entire economy. In fact, entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as national assets to be cultivated and motivated to the greatest possible extent. In today’s global economy, exciting opportunities for cross border trade exist like never before. As a result of this, international entrepreneurship and innovation have come to the forefront of discussions in recent times. International entrepreneurship can be defined as “… the process of an entrepreneur conducting business activities across national boundaries.” Alternatively, it can also be defined as,“… a combination of innovative, proactive and risk seeking behavior that crosses national borders and is intended to create value within organizations.” For international entrepreneurship, there are a slew of factors that have to be taken into consideration such as economics, type of economic system, political-legal environment, culture, acceptance to risk etc. In addition to understanding entrepreneurship in other countries, it is important for local entrepreneurs to understand the kinds of practices that lead to innovations in other countries. ||Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.|2015|Tom Hope, Michael Wilson, Dirk Hecht, Gunter Hofbauer, Andreas Jattke, Vineeth Vijayraghavan|American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM)||||||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AhqOjcs7Dif8C%26tzom%3D420
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||Towards Understanding the Effects of Outsourcing on the Flexibility Dynamic of System of Systems||The requirements of various stakeholders associated with System of Systems (SoS) are constantly changing. Consequently, the shareholders’ priorities of return and risk continuously shift. However, their expectations of gaining value from the SoS are enhancing. One way of enhancing value from the SoS is by having the right amount of flexibility associated with it. Flexibility can be defined as the ability of a system to be able to adapt and cope with the changing environment. SoS flexibility means creating options at various levels, developing ways and means of change across the range of options. One possible way of creating enterprise flexibility is by outsourcing certain functions which would help affect the flexibility of an organization. The outsourcing done might also have an effect on each of the building blocks of SoS flexibility.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||AC 2012-4002: APPLICATION OF CASE STUDIES TO ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING EDUCATION||As engineering system complexity has increased over the years, numerous complex systems projects have failed due to the lack of an appropriate systemic perspective. Since the solution to this challenge is itself a complex system, educating and training our current and future technical leaders on these challenges, and providing suggested changes in their mind sets, is imperative. As an educational tool, case studies can be a platform through which the analysis, knowledge application, and drawing of conclusions can occur to facilitate coping with the most complex systems. Case study learning has proven successful in the training of business leaders with real life examples of the strategies and tactics used by leading businesses to succeed globally. A valuable characteristic of case studies is that they support a holistic understanding and interpretation of the systems of action or interrelated activities engaged in by the participants. However, case studies are not as broadly used in engineering management and systems engineering education. This paper describes the importance of case studies to engineering management and systems engineering education, discusses frameworks for their implementation, and presents a case study template that can be used as a guideline in engineering education. ||||S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AJV2RwH3_ST0C%26tzom%3D420

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi||Innovative Modifications to Teaching Entrepreneurship to Engineers in the 21 st Century||Innovation and entrepreneurship are becoming increasingly important as we rely on economies to create jobs around the globe. And yet, considering myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21 st century and the increasing power the consumer controls, the risk of doing entrepreneurship has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner to be able to confront new-age entrepreneurship in a new light and thus increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. In this paper, the authors will talk about a potential new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship education for engineers in the 21st millennium. This approach will focus on inclusive, key concepts from Quality Management, Systems Engineering, Globalization and Sustainability for the Entrepreneurship curriculum, as these are topics that need to be understood by potential entrepreneurs to be successful. A new curriculum that can be taught as a workshop or as courses in the entrepreneurship domain will be developed subsequently and presented as part of this paper. ||||S Jimmy Gandhi, MD Wilson, Lewlyn Rodrigues|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3ATFP_iSt0sucC%26tzom%3D420

As the engineering profession evolves, an increasing need has emerged for entry-level engineering professionals who have both a broad engineering background and the knowledge and ability to interface between the business and technical functions of organizations. It was to meet this demand that university X, introduced an EM program at the undergraduate level effective Fall 2009. Undergraduate engineering management majors learn engineering fundamentals, together with the art and science of planning, organizing, allocating resources, and directing and controlling activities in technological environments. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management equips entry-level engineers with knowledge of the business of engineering, making them valuable to their employers and ensuring future professional growth. For students who enjoy people and technology, the technical challenges of engineering, and the opportunity to integrate higher-level organizational considerations into technological decision-making processes, engineering management is an ideal program of study (CSUN 2014),(Becker, 2007). ||age||S Jimmy Gandhi, Ahmad R Sarfaraz||||24|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AHDshCWvjkbEC%26tzom%3D420

However, in today’s rapidly evolving competitive world, the United States can no longer take its supremacy for granted. The decline of the United States’ share of intellectual property (IP) is one indication of its loss of competitiveness. According to studies carried out by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004, the United States is losing its dominance in the fields of science and innovation. In January 2008 the NSF again noticed the decline in US technological dominance. Because innovative ideas tend to be developed by younger engineers or scientists, an area that cries out is the improvement of undergraduate engineers who are currently illiterate in IP, in general, and of the role of IP in innovation, in particular. ||||S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IyGH1YcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DIyGH1YcAAAAJ%3AW7OEmFMy1HYC%26tzom%3D420

Bingbing Li||Life cycle environmental impact of high-capacity lithium ion battery with silicon nanowires anode for electric vehicles||Although silicon nanowires (SiNW) have been widely studied as an ideal material for developing high-capacity lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles (EVs), little is known about the environmental impacts of such a new EV battery pack during its whole life cycle. This paper reports a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a high-capacity LIB pack using SiNW prepared via metal-assisted chemical etching as anode material.

Bingbing Li||Life Cycle Assessment of Lithium Ion Batteries with Silicon Nanowire Anode for Electric Vehicles||While silicon nanowires have demonstrated great potential for application on lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles, their environmental impacts have never been investigated. For a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has to be used to evaluate the potential impact of the product from cradle to grave. In this paper, the LCA is carried out on the environmental impacts of a high performance lithium ion battery system with silicon nanowire anode. The LCA modeling is based on laboratory data, literature references and the Gabi 6 Professional Database on a 43.2 kWh battery system for an EV with 10 year life. The environmental impacts of lithium ion battery system are analyzed in the whole life cycle. Introduction: Electric vehicles (EVs) are more environmental friendly than conventional internal-combustion-engine powered vehicles and are expected to be used in large fleet vehicle applications in the following several decades worldwide. It has been predicted that the global market for EVs will expand from 1.2 m in 2010 to 6.1 m in 2015 and to 19.8 m in 2020 (Watabe, 2011). Current EVs are powered by lithium ion batteries. Current lithium ion batteries are made of graphite anode which has a relatively small specific capacity (372 mAh/g), and accordingly, can only power the EV for a limited driving range. In comparison, silicon has a high theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh/g) and has been widely recognized as the ideal anode active material for next generation high capacity lithium ion batteries (Chan, 2008). Such novel lithium ion batteries, in theory, can power electric vehicles for up to 10 times the … ||IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems & Technology (ISSST 2013). doi: DOI|2013|Bingbing Li, Jianyang Li, Chris Yuan||||10|||m9||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3AZeXyd9-uunAC%26tzom%3D420
Bingbing Li||Design and Analysis of Shape Memory Polymer snap-Fits for Active Disassembly||Disassembly is becoming a mandatory step in the end-of-life processing for electronic products. More and more regulations call for the removal of hazardous materials and mandate the recovery of components and recyclable materials. It is then no surprise that research has continually looked for more efficient methods of disassembly. Of these methods, active disassembly is at the forefront. Active disassembly incorporates innovative fasteners, which under a special environmental condition will exhibit a disassembling or releasing action. The use of smart materials, more specifically shape memory alloys and shape memory polymers, has been extensively documented. For shape memory polymers, past research has shown innovative designs, such as thread-losing screws and deformable brackets. What has not been shown with shape memory polymers, however, is one of the most basic and common fasteners-the snap-fit. This paper examines the design and processing method for creating a shape memory polymer snap-fit and demonstrates its effectiveness as an actively disassembling fastener. |||2009|John Carrell, Hong-Chao Zhang, Derrick Tate, Chengcheng Fan, Bingbing Li|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3AdQ2og3OwTAUC%26tzom%3D420

Bingbing Li||Backtracking algorithm-based disassembly sequence planning||Disassembly sequence planning (DSP) is one of the core research themes of product life cycle design. Effective DSP can reduce product life cycle costs as well as their environmental effects and provides a theoretical future foundation for recycling and improving sustainability performance. The problem with current heuristic artificial intelligence algorithms is that the outcome may have a local extremum; therefore, it may not generate the exact or even the approximate optimum solution. For a specific sequence planning problem, some algorithm parameters need to be adjusted in order to generate a perfect solution. In this study, the objective is to create new DSP by integrating a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) based on backtracking algorithms.

Bingbing Li||Influence of Preheating Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Laser Cladding Layer||Physical and chemical changes always occur in the process of laser cladding, and the cladding quality is directly affected by processing parameters. This paper mainly focused on effects of temperature field of preheating substrate on the cladding quality. Laser cladding process has the following experimental parameters: laser power, powder feeding rate and rotational speed. Three types of cladding powders were used: Ni60A, Cr12MoV and WC-Co. Experiments were conducted by using different substrate preheating temperatures and cladding materials, which affect the quality of cladding layers. Comparison and analysis of the three types of powders showed that under different preheating temperatures, the cladding layer is mainly affected by tensile stress. Besides that, the residual stress of cladding layer is always higher than that of heat affected zone and substrates. The best preheating temperature to test the residual stress for three types of powders are: 600℃, 400℃ and 300℃. For all three types of powders under different preheating temperatures, cladding layer and substrate have compact and uniform structures. However, when substrate is overheated the cracking will occur in the substrate. Under different preheating temperatures, the Vickers hardness is higher than that of heat affected zone and the substrate for all three materials. The preheating temperatures for getting the maximum hardness are respectively 300℃, 600℃ and 400℃. |||2016/6/27|Jibin Jiang, Guofu Lian, Mingsan Xu, Chunyu Li, Bingsan Chen, Bingbing Li|American Society of Mechanical Engineers||||||V001T02A031-V001T02A031||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3A7T2F9Uy0os0C%26tzom%3D420

This fundamental study will be used to print increasingly viable and complex tissue shapes with living cells. |||2016|Daniel Aguiar, Amanda Albuquerque, Bingbing Li|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3AFu2w8maKXqMC%26tzom%3D420

Since used key components are identified as the core in remanufacturing, each component and its own condition should be considered in decision-making. Thus, with mapping the relationship between product performance and its key components failure condition, a timing decision-making method in proactive remanufacturing is presented to conduct the remanufacturing with low consuming per year. Moreover, the remanufacturability of key components at the time with low consumption per year is evaluated. Finally, a diesel engine is given as an instance to validate the method. ||Procedia CIRP|2016/1/1|Qingdi Ke, Hui Wang, Shouxu Song, BingBing Li|Elsevier|||48|||182-187||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3A4fKUyHm3Qg0C%26tzom%3D420

However, significant sustainability issues and challenges exist in the practical integration and subsequent operations of the integrated macro-nano industrial systems, including increased waste generations, extra energy consumptions, additional greenhouse gas emissions, novel nanoparticle emissions for occupational and public exposure, etc. This paper will analyze which competence domains, a curriculum towards sustainable manufacturing should have and how a certificate program in “Sustainable Manufacturing” can be accomplished. This curriculum design is based on the experience of creating and teaching new graduate level courses “Sustainable Manufacturing” at Texas Tech University and “Energy Efficiency and Industrial Sustainability” at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. All segments of society must be educated to understand, environmental, economic and social connections within manufacturing systems engineering to facilitate sustainability. The innovations in technology and management play a fundamental role in solving the global challenge in economic development, while simultaneously preserving life, conserving natural resources and creation of social justice. This pilot study could be a pioneer for further countries in the world such as China, Indian, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which would be interested in implementing sustainable manufacturing. ||age|2015|Bingbing Li, S Jimmy Gandhi, Li Ding||||26|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=paxY8dMAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DpaxY8dMAAAAJ%3ANJ774b8OgUMC%26tzom%3D420

In this paper, informed by the modular design method, the total energy performance in modular product can be analyzed and separated into the energy performances of basic modules. And with the physical analysis of basic modules, the energy equations are established with the band graphs theory. Then, the physical parameters, which could influence the energy consumption, are identified as “energy factor”. Thus, the energy consumption of the modules could be optimized with adjusting design factors, and the energy-saving design scheme for the whole product is obtained in the optimized model.

Unfortunately, due to the diversiform and transformable energy, it is well know that energysaving designs are mostly depends on the experiments and experience which are time and money consuming. In the most product, since the efficiency of the energy sources and action mechanisms have been significantly improved, the energy consuming depends on the its transfer in the product. In this paper, the energy transfer between the energy source and action mechanism is analyzed and quantified, and the transfer function is established with the Band graphs theory. Then, informed by the control theory, the transfer function could be classified, and the important variable which is usually called “transfer parameters” in this function could be educed. Furthermore, with the adjusting the transfer parameters, the balance of input and output could be optimized for the least unwanted energy consuming in the energy transfer.

Mark Rajai||Inter-University Teams Working on Joint Products||In the real world, global out-sourcing is causing industrial products to be developed in virtual teams to reduce costs and development times [1]. These needs have created the opportunity for this proposed project. Here product teams must design and manufacture new products where the team members are not co-located in the same place at the same time [2]. It is important to introduce this into the classroom, because virtual interactions are becoming increasingly important as separated teams jointly develop products. Over the last few years, two problems have evolved in the teaching of new product development. First, one course was not enough to stimulate product creativity. The teams needed more instruction and experiential learning in order to develop innovative products with high market potential. Second, LMU's graduate students have had great difficulty meeting together in colocated teams due to their busy schedules, off-site travel in their jobs and driving long distances in traffic in order to meet with their teams. These problems could be solved by designing twosemester courses in new product development and entrepreneurship that utilized the internet for team collaboration. In this way the students would have more time to nurture creative products. Furthermore, the teams would be able to interact at their own convenience, which would enable them to save time by not having to meet as often as a co-located team. ||paper to be presented at 4th Annual National Collegiate Inventors and Innovation Alliance (NCIIA) Conference, Washington, DC|2000/3/9|Mel Mendelson, Gary Sibeck, Mark Rajai, B Bostick, H Bostick|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3Au-x6o8ySG0sC%26tzom%3D420
Mark Rajai||A survivability model for ejection of green compacts in powder metallurgy technology||Reliability and quality assurance have become major considerations in the design and manufacture of today’s parts and products. Survivability of green compact using powder metallurgy technology is considered as one of the major quality attributes in manufacturing systems today. During powder metallurgy (PM) production, the compaction conditions and behavior of the metal powder dictate the stress and density distribution in the green compact prior to sintering. These parameters greatly influence the mechanical properties and overall strength of the final component. In order to improve these properties, higher compaction pressures are usually employed, which make unloading and ejection of green compacts more challenging, especially for the powder-compacted parts with relatively complicated shapes. This study looked at a mathematical survivability model concerning green compact characteristics in PM technology and the stress-strength failure model in reliability engineering. This model depicts the relationship between mechanical loads (stress) during ejection, experimentally determined green strength and survivability of green compact. The resulting survivability is the probability that a green compact survives during and after ejection. This survivability model can be used as an efficient tool for selecting the appropriate parameters for the process planning stage in PM technology. A case study is presented here in order to demonstrate the application of the proposed survivability model. ||International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations|2012|Payman Ahi, Kouroush Jenab, Ahmad Ghasempoor, M Rajabi||||3|1||15-24||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AYsMSGLbcyi4C%26tzom%3D420
Mark Rajai||Using database technology to improve STEM student retention: A total quality management approach to early alert and intervention||Students at risk of dropping out of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs often display signs that indicate they are at risk. A need exists to identify at risk STEM students early and to develop and implement effective intervention strategies that utilize the Total Quality Management (TQM) approach. Most of all, a database system is needed to track this early intervention process, if retention rates are to be improved. To address this need at a small community college in North Carolina, a system was developed and underwent a pilot study in Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. The two pilot groups were compared to the two control groups to identify differences in retention, course credit completion rates, and grade point averages (GPA). The first pilot group displayed no significant differences, while the second pilot group displayed significant differences in most of the areas analyzed in the study, indicating a database system can be used to improve STEM student retention. While the second of the two pilot groups displayed promising results, managerial and logistical issues, such as less than optimal instructor involvement, impeded success were identified. This paper will describe the design, implementation, and the preliminary results of this study and outlines the need for further research that confirms these preliminary findings. ||Management Science Letters|2002|S Khoury, K Jenab, D Staub, M Rajai||||2|2||647-654||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AW7OEmFMy1HYC%26tzom%3D420

Among these tactics are outsourcing engineering and scientific jobs to nations overseas. Another, is employing only those workers who can satisfy their immediate needs. These practices have economic implications for the employers since employment decisions are determined solely by the profit/loss calculations in a time economic exigency. It also has economic implications for engineering graduates in search for jobs with salaries commensurate to their education and skills. This paper will combine the results of a survey conducted by the authors on this subject with information from recently published studies.

The course initially was an elective course that became very popular with our freshman students. Because of its popularity, it became a required course for all freshmen with less than thirty credit hours. The focus of the course was and is to foster relationships with students and faculty, help students verify their decision to choose engineering technology or help them at least make informed decisions centered on choosing a major. The course uses a variety of teaching strategies and innovative approaches of instructions to attract and retain students in the field. This manuscript details many of the approaches that are used in the course that has been proven successful.

Small structures are known to exhibit superior mechanical properties attributed to their finer microstructure. This includes stress-life response at low and high cycle fatigue. The fatigue life of small structures involves crack initiation and crack propagation stages. While the crack initiation stage is known to be a significant component of fatigue life, experimental verification of its impact has not been performed. Using the compliance response of small LIGA Ni structures in load control mode and under cyclic loading conditions, the contributions of crack initiation and propagation to fatigue life were quantified.

Mark Rajai||Revenue and production management in a multi-echelon supply chain||This paper models a supply chain problem and employs simulation-based optimization to analyze it. The model represents a manufacturer of multiple products from multiple raw materials that has control over the price of the products. The decisions to be optimized in the model are ordering policies of raw materials, inventory control of finished goods, manufacturing capacity of each product, and prices set on the products. The uncertainties involved are lead times of ordering inventory and the demand of the products. We consider the case of periodic review of raw materials and finished goods inventories on discrete time. The objective is to find the best configuration of the system to maximize profit. We show how simulation-based optimization could find the best configuration through an example. |||2013/12/8|Alireza Kabirian, Ahmad Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai|IEEE||||||3330-3339||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3ASe3iqnhoufwC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||DEVELOPMENT OF AN AHP-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING A PROJECT MANAGER||Assigning projects to project managers is one of the most important activities in an organization. It can strongly affect the performance of organizations or the results of their teams. Most projects are normally assigned to project managers according to their expertise and experiences in organizations. In this study, the authors looked at a model based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assign a project manager. It is based on the quantitative and qualitative managerial competencies of people who are candidates for becoming team leaders and project managers. This approach is more efficient when the scope of the project is broad and none of the functional departments take the lead over the project. In this case, the methodology can make the work of assigning a project to a project manager more scientific and fair. Also presented is a subject illustrated case for selecting the best project manager for a given project out of four candidates. ||TRY ACAMEDICS!|2011|Seyed F Montazeri, Ahmad R Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai, Robert A Matthews|||||||83||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AroLk4NBRz8UC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||DEVELOPMENT OF A MODIFIED HEURISTIC METHOD TO OPTIMIZE A SINGLE MACHINE OPERATION||This study is an extension of “A Heuristic Algorithm for Sequencing on One Machine to Minimize Total Tardiness” developed by JE Holsenback and RM Russell. They utilized a powerful theorem of Emmons to introduce a heuristic method, which uses Net Benefit of Relocation (NBR) analysis to determine which job should be placed in last position to reduce total tardiness of the schedule. Although their unique and simple algorithm resulted in optimal solution in many cases, it provided only sub-optimal solutions when the problem set possessed a multi-nodal earliest due date (EDD). We modified their algorithm by employing three new approaches in such a situations, resulting in average 15% improvement. we also extended their algorithm to include weighted factors (jobs with varying importance) associated with each job. The Modified Net Benefit of Relocation (MNBR) algorithm to minimize total tardiness on a single machine is introduced. Two examples employing the MNBR approach are also presented. ||The International Journal of Applied Management and Technology|2007|Mark R Rajai, Morteza Sadat Hossieney|||||||6||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AIjCSPb-OGe4C%26tzom%3D420
Mark Rajai||Mass customization and its curricular implications for four-year degree programs in manufacturing technologies||Mass customization is fast emerging as a popular business strategy which aims to also cater to individual expressed needs of end users at prices closely comparable to mass produced items. Companies are able to switch to this mode of operation by primarily making their own operations demand-driven, flexible systems and asking their suppliers to do the same. Customers by and large are delighted to be part of this new kind of supply chain and are willing to invest time to specify what exactly they want provided businesses are willing to keep their end of the bargain in terms of high quality, timeliness and prompt service. The probability of manufacturing technology graduates encountering demand-driven manufacturing systems that operate on a mass customization paradigm is very high per current indicators. This paper concludes with a synopsis of certain imperatives for inclusion in a detailed examination of the curricula in four year degree programs. Specifically, we suggest that students should be prepared to perform value stream analysis, work towards developing a firm’s core competency, and be able to analyze and improve supply chain operations. |||2006/10/20|Radha Balamuralikrishna, Kurt A Rosentrater, Mark Rajai|||||||19-21||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3A9yKSN-GCB0IC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||Cooperative Education-Innovative Approaches for Partnerships between Universities and Industries and High Schools||Over the last few years, continuous learning has become an essential element of job success, and workplace learning linked to career development has become part of the educational system of the future. Today, many industries are increasingly depending on cooperative education (co-op) and internship programs with universities, colleges and sometimes with high schools. However, they do not perceive how to start one or what is expected from them. In some cases, high schools aren’t aware of how to establish good relations and better communication with the industry. Some department chairs or administrators don’t recognize the role of co-op in the academy, or else they decide to overlook it. Therefore, co-op with a clear expectation and assessment should be part of student educational experience. Educators, students and industries will all gain substantial benefits from their involvement in this process. The objective of this paper is to make the university and high schools’ educators aware of the opportunities they could offer their students in industrial area. Students have the chance to experience the real world of industry with hands on experience simultaneously with the education they receive at school. ||age|2005|Ali Kashef, Mark Rajai, Akbar Eslami, Ali Setoodehnnia||||10|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AZph67rFs4hoC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||Development of a Virtual Center for Product innovation and Commercialization||It is estimated that nearly 90% of all new businesses fail within the first five years. Failure of these businesses is often contributed to poor planning and management of the company. Although there is help available for new businesses, it is often very basic and not enough to assist new companies to grow and survive in the competitive global marketplace of today. Therefore, a need exists for a comprehensive resource center to provide various assistance to new companies. The Virtual Center for Product Innovation and Commercialization (CPIC) is a proposed consortium between Northern Kentucky University, University of Kentucky, University of Louisville and Purdue University. Each university would provide technical assistance in the areas of their expertise. CPIC would be available for new entrepreneurs, start-up companies, and existing companies to use 24 hours a day. In addition to reaching a wider audience this virtual center would reduce overhead costs for the universities. From conception CIPC would offer a number of modules to assist new businesses, with additional modules and features added in the future. Another innovative aspect of CPIC is that it involves students from participating universities to work with faculty experts assigned to each module. Students, especially those majored in entrepreneurial fields will gain valuable practical experience in this process. In this article, we present the development of this unique virtual center in details. ||age|2003|Mark Rajai, Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Robert Matthews||||10|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3A-f6ydRqryjwC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||Conquering the hurdles of the tenure and promotion process for Junior Faculty Members||The process of tenure and promotion can be a harrowing experience for faculty in higher education. A tenured faculty member is one whose job, with a few exceptions, is secured for life. These exceptions typically include the closure of the department,(although a good faith effort may be made to place them in a related department within the university), gross negligence, and sexual harassment. Tenure was designed to protect faculty from the volatile behavior and attitudes of administrators. The process generally occurs in the sixth year of employment and for many can be stressful. A candidate for tenure and promotion is evaluated in the areas of teaching, scholarship and service.

Mark Rajai||Development of an Integrated System for Design Evaluation||In this paper, two software packages (AutoCAD and Mannequin) are integrated to create an ergonomic CAD system. This developed system will provide designers with a powerful graphical tool to evaluate their design for human factors and safety criteria. An absence of a truly integrated ergonomic CAD system that has been desired by many researchers and designers was the motivating factor behind our efforts. Steps taken to integrate these two somewhat incompatible software is explained in this paper. Now designers have an ergonomic CAD system to assist them to design products according to physical abilities and characteristics of their human operators. Utilizing this type of technology could revolutionize the way products are designed and significantly reduce the alarming number of related injuries, thus saving millions of dollars. This integrated system could also substantially reduce the critical factor of time to market and lower overall cost of designing new products by allowing designers to test their products for human fit without having to build a prototype or using real subject. ||age||Mark R Rajai, Keith V Johnson, Robert Matthews||||5|||1||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AULOm3_A8WrAC%26tzom%3D420

The distance measurement unit, or sub VI, communicates directly with the microcontrollers that contain ultrasound transmitters and RF receivers. The signal from the ultrasound receiver is processed via a custom-built circuit on the mobile unit. The sub VI generates a pulse of 40 KHz via a NI-6602 32-bit counter timer card. As the pulse is received and processed on the mobile unit, it then transmits an RF signal back to the RF receiver on the base unit. The counter timer card will repeat the signal to the sub VI to begin the distance calculation once the RF receiver captures a signal from the mobile unit. ||||Ravindra Thamma, Gregory Marshall, Hugo Cuervo Garcia, Mark Rajai|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3A0EnyYjriUFMC%26tzom%3D420

Mark Rajai||RAISING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO MANUFACTUE AND MARKET ACADEME-INVENTED PRODUCTS||With recent Internet bubble burst, many venture capitalist firms are very reluctant to provide seed money for new ventures. And with growing academic budget problems many universities simply do not have revenue available to fund new projects. This paper presents several years of research to find effective ways to form partnerships between industry and academe to raise capital investments to manufacture and market academe-invented products. This paper discusses many obstacles and challenges that engineering institutions have to face in order to form a partnership with industry to bring academe-invented projects to the market. The hard lessons learned should serve as valuable guidelines to many engineering institutions that are embarking on forming a similar partnership with industry. A successful business plan and formation of a spin-off company are also discussed. ||||Mark Rajai, Robert Matthews|||||||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dVKU26kAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DdVKU26kAAAAJ%3AqjMakFHDy7sC%26tzom%3D420

Maryam Tabibzadeh||Applying the AcciMap methodology to investigate the tragic Sewol Ferry accident in South Korea||This study applies the AcciMap methodology, which was originally proposed by Professor Jens Rasmussen (1997), to the analysis of the tragic Sewol Ferry accident in South Korea on April 16, 2014, which killed 304 mostly young people and is considered as a national disaster in that country. This graphical representation, by incorporating associated socio-technical factors into an integrated framework, provides a big-picture to illustrate the context in which an accident occurred as well as the interactions between different levels of the studied system that resulted in that event. In general, analysis of past accidents within the stated framework can define the patterns of hazards within an industrial sector. Such analysis can lead to the definition of preconditions for safe operations, which is a main focus of proactive risk management systems.

Maryam Tabibzadeh||Learning from the BP Deepwater Horizon accident: risk analysis of human and organizational factors in negative pressure test||According to several seminal investigation reports on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) accident, misinterpretation of a critical test, called negative pressure test (NPT), was a major contributing cause of that disaster. NPT, according to many credible references, is the primary step to ascertain well integrity during any offshore drilling. This paper introduces a three-layer, conceptual risk analysis framework to assess the critical role of human and organizational factors in conducting and interpreting a negative pressure test. This framework has been developed by generalizing the risk assessment model that was proposed by the authors for the analysis of the conducted NPT by the DWH crew. In addition, the application of the introduced framework in this study is not limited to NPT misinterpretation.

Maryam Tabibzadeh||A Signal Detection Model to Interpret Safety Tests in Offshore Oil Drilling||According to the findings of the US District Court on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) case,“the misinterpretation of the negative pressure test was a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, fire, and oil spill.” It is noteworthy that the Negative Pressure Test (NPT) was not only specific to the Macondo well operations; rather it is a critical procedure to ascertain well integrity in offshore drilling in general. Therefore, the correct interpretation of this test and designing optimal responses is crucial for the safety of future offshore drilling. This paper uses signal detection theory and proposes a model to provide responses to warning signals in offshore drilling and, in particular, to optimally respond to the findings of NPTs. The structure and generic parametric equations of this model enable oil and gas practitioners to calculate a cut-off point value, as a threshold to accept or reject an implemented NPT, which is crucial in the … ||Proceedings of 2018 Probability Safety Assessment and Management Conference.

However, with spot welding (1) structural performance of the joint may be degraded through heat-affected zones created by the high temperature thermal joining process, (2) achieving the double-sided access necessary for the spot welding electrodes may limit design flexibility, and (3) variability with welds leads to production inconsistencies. Selfpiercing rivets have been used before; however they require different rivet/die combinations depending on the material being joined, which adds to process complexity.

Durul Ulutan||Stochastic tool wear assessment in milling difficult to machine alloys||In the machining industry, maximising profit is intuitively a primary goal; therefore continuously increasing machining process uptime and consequently productivity and efficiency is crucial. Tool wear plays an important factor in both machining uptime and quality, and since tool failure is related to the surface quality and the dimensional accuracy of the end product, it is essential to quantify and predict this phenomenon with the best possible certainty. One of the most common ways of tool wear prediction is through the use of low cost spindle current sensing technology which is used to measure spindle power consumption in CNC machines and relate power increase to tool wear. In this work, two methods of stochastic filtering (ie Kalman and particle filter) were used in predicting tool flank wear in machining difficult-to-machine materials through spindle power consumption measurements. Results show a maximum of 15% average error in estimation, which indicates the good potential of using stochastic filtering techniques in estimating tool flank wear. In addition, the particle filter was used for online estimation of a spindle power model parameter with uniform and Gaussian mixture models as the initial probability density functions, and the evolution of this parameter to the true posterior density function over time was investigated. ||International Journal of Mechatronics and Manufacturing Systems|2015|Farbod Akhavan Niaki, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|Inderscience Publishers (IEL)|||8|3-4||134-159||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3AaqlVkmm33-oC%26tzom%3D420

Modeling the residual stress profile is currently tedious and inaccurate. This study introduces a new method of understanding the residual stress profile in terms of quantifiable key measures: peak tensile stress at the surface, magnitude and depth of peak compressive stress, and depth at which residual stress becomes near-zero. Experiments in turning IN-100 and milling GTD-111 have been conducted and subsequent X-ray Diffraction measurements have been utilized to obtain residual stress profiles. Using a sinusoidal decay function fitted to measured residual stress profiles, these four key profile measures are extracted and then the effects of process parameters such as cutting speed, feed, cutting edge radius, and tool coating on these measures are investigated. ||Procedia CIRP|2014|D Ulutan, YM Arisoy, T Özel, Laine Mears|Elsevier|||13|||365-370||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3ALkGwnXOMwfcC%26tzom%3D420

This feature makes these alloys a suitable candidate for power generation industry. However, high wear rate and tooling cost are known as the challenges in machining Ni-based alloys. The high wear rate causes a rapid failure of the tool, and therefore, fewer data will be available for model development. In addition, variations in material properties and hardness, residual stress, tool runout, and tolerances are some uncontrollable effects adding uncertainties to the currently developed models.

This study presents a new FE simulation-based methodology to determine the modified constitutive model parameters utilizing the force results from face turning experiments conducted for both Ti-6Al-4V and IN-100. In these simulations, material constitutive models have a great influence on the results and must be selected carefully to represent the correct material flow stress characteristics. Conventional modified constitutive material models with flow softening behavior are utilized and further modified to represent the thermal softening effect on the flow softening behavior, where the temperatures can be much higher than normal for machining these materials. Parameters of the temperaturedependent flow softening based material constitutive model for both materials have been determined by using an inverse methodology. Comparison of measured and simulated forces with the modified material models has shown close agreements. ||Proceedings of NAMRI/SME|2013/6/10|Durul Ulutan, Tuğrul Özel||||41|||||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3A_FxGoFyzp5QC%26tzom%3D420

They play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength, high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. Machinability suffers as a result of these properties and harsh machining conditions occur, resulting in high cutting forces and tool wear. To combat the difficulties in the machining of nickel-based superalloys, such as poor thermal diffusivity and high levels of abrasive wear, trochoidal milling was introduced as an alternative method of milling.

The high wear rate of this material induces a rapid transition from a sharp state to a dull state of the tool, and hence limits the number of available data for model establishment. To address this challenge, a neural network with Bayesian regularisation is designed and its performance is compared with regression and time-series models. A maximum of 4% estimation error for Bayesian regularisation neural network, compared to 33% and 17% estimation error of the latter models, shows the good potential of this technique when a limited dataset is available.

Therefore, monitoring tool condition from the initial to final stages of tool life is a task that is critical yet difficult, especially in hard-to-machine materials. In this work, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is used for extracting statistical features in the time-frequency domain of two low cost sensing technologies, i.e. vibration and power, in addition to Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. A Recurrent Neural Network is then trained with Bayesian regularization backpropagation method and the estimated tool wear is compared to the actual measured wear. Results show a maximum of 13% relative error in estimating tool wear which proves the effectiveness of implemented sensory data fusion … |||2015/9/14|Farbod Akhavan Niaki, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|IEEE||||||271-276||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3AM3ejUd6NZC8C%26tzom%3D420
Durul Ulutan||Methodology to determine friction in orthogonal cutting with application to machining titanium and nickel based alloys||Friction plays a very important role in machining titanium and nickel alloys. It is the source for the high amount of heat generation, and as a result, the excessive tool wear during machining these materials. The worn tool is known to create lower surface qualities with tensile surface residual stresses and machine-induced hardening at the surface, as well as high surface roughness. It is essential to create a method to determine how and to what extent the friction is built up on the tool. This study facilitates a determination methodology to estimate the friction coefficients between the tool and the chip on the rake face, as well as the tool and the workpiece on the flank face of the tool. The results are validated with experimental results from the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V and the nickel alloy IN-100. |||2012/6/4|Durul Ulutan, Tuğrul Özel|American Society of Mechanical Engineers||||||327-334||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3AWF5omc3nYNoC%26tzom%3D420

Durul Ulutan||Prediction of tool wear based on cutting forces when end milling titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V||Research regarding tool wear in the machining of difficult materials is important because it is a significant indicator of process failure in terms of degradation of part quality, and the resulting high cost and increased process time. Prior researchers have investigated the effects of cutting parameters on tool wear and as a result, tool life has seen significant improvement. However, these studies are not concerned with tool flank wear during machining; they instead focus on tool flank wear after a certain amount of cutting distance. This study proposes a new method of predicting tool flank wear during machining that has the capability of suggesting tool failure without directly measuring the tool. For this purpose, a detailed set of experiments on end milling of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V was conducted and analyzed.

Micro-milling is an effective process for direct fabrication of titanium components. This paper presents some experimental investigations on micromilling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with uncoated and cBN coated micro-end mills. Micro-milling of straight channels are conducted and surface roughness, burr formation and tool wear are measured. A performance comparison of the micro-end mills is also provided. An experimental design is utilized to analyze the influence of process parameters on the quality of fabricated channels. Multi-criteria optimization studies are also conducted to identify the process parameters which minimize the surface roughness and burr formation concurrently. ||Proceedings of the 6th International Conference and Exhibition on Design and Production of Machines and Dies/Molds|2011/6|T Özel, T Thepsonthi, D Ulutan, B Kaftanoğlu|||||||23-26||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3A5nxA0vEk-isC%26tzom%3D420

Durul Ulutan||Predictive modeling and multi-objective optimization of maching-induced residual stresses: investigation of machining parameter effects||Description In the aerospace industry, titanium and nickel-based alloys are frequently used for critical structural components, especially due to their higher strength at both low and high temperatures, and higher wear and chemical degradation resistance. However, because of their unfavorable thermal properties, deformation and friction-induced microstructural changes prevent the end products from having good surface integrity properties. In addition to surface roughness, microhardness changes, and microstructural alterations, the machining-induced residual stress profiles of titanium and nickel-based alloys contribute in the surface integrity of these products.

Durul Ulutan||Effect of Thermal Assistance on the Joining of Al6063 During Flow Drill Screwdriving||An increase in fuel economy standards has affected automakers’ decision toward designing lightweight vehicles and therefore transitioning from steel-based bodies to ones predominantly composed of aluminum. An introduction to lightweight materials couples that of lightweight joining with a thermo-mechanical process, Flow Drill Screwdriving (FDS). This process is favored in terms of robustness, short installation time, and only requiring access to one side. The most significant challenge of this process is reducing the material sheet separation to minimize any possibility of corrosion buildup. Warm forming of aluminum has been shown to increase ductility and formability of the material and thus the process benefits from a reduced cycle time that leads to cost reduction. In this study, the effect of an auxiliary heat source on the flow of Al6063 is investigated for the FDS application.

For reliable results, CBM systems need early and reliable warning based on prediction models that use multiple types of sensors. In this study, tool flank wear during end milling difficult-to-machine alloys was measured using an optical microscope. Then, vibration data collected with an accelerometer was investigated for its relationship to tool flank wear. The developed relationship between accelerometer output and tool flank wear was validated with further experiments. It was observed from frequency domain responses of these outputs that specific harmonics of the tool pass frequency were dominant, and tool flank wear can be related to the amplitude of these harmonics during machining. This way, it was shown that through accurate online prediction of tool wear, premature interruption of the process … |||2015/6/8|Vasileios Bardis, Farbod Akhavan Niaki, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|American Society of Mechanical Engineers||||||V001T02A113-V001T02A113||||https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=F_czDEcAAAAJ#d=gs_md_cita-d&u=%2Fcitations%3Fview_op%3Dview_citation%26hl%3Den%26user%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%26cstart%3D20%26pagesize%3D80%26citation_for_view%3DF_czDEcAAAAJ%3A_kc_bZDykSQC%26tzom%3D420
