Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|It's a Nuisance: The Future of Fracking Litigation in the Wake of Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.|Hilary M Goldberg, Melanie Stallings Williams, Deborah Cours|2015|Va. Envtl. LJ|33||1||Hydraulic fracturing, or" fracking," is a polarizing topic, having earned both staunch advocates who see its possibilities for the domestic production of energy and ardent opponents who anticipate dire consequences resulting from its environmental impact. The practice has resulted in over one hundred lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, none of which have gone to verdict prior to the recent jury decision in Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc. 1 Because its result did not rest on a conclusion that the practice of fracking itself constituted a compensable wrong, Parr neither vindicated the oil and gas industry by exonerating it nor validated critics of fracking. Instead, the decision, based on a single cause of action of intentional private nuisance, demonstrated that juries were willing to find in favor of private plaintiffs even without a showing that fracking itself resulted in direct harm to the lives and property of those living nearby. The jury … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|On Parr: The Use and Propriety of Appraisal Methods in Computing Fracking Awards|Hilary M Golberg, Ray Calnan|2016|JL & Com.|35||55||Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.,'made headlines in 2014 for being the first hydraulic fracturing (" Tracking") case to result in a jury verdict. In Parr, a Texas jury awarded $2.925 million to compensate the Parr family for injuries sustained resulting from Aruba Petroleum's nearby fracking activities. Of the nearly $3 million Parr verdict, later reversed on other grounds, the jury awarded $275,000 for diminution in property value. 2 Thanks to the fiercely litigated and highly publicized trial and appeal, scholars, practitioners and academics received a rare glimpse into an area of litigation otherwise insulated from public view by out of court resolutions and confidential settlement agreements. 3 In this interdisciplinary paper, we will provide an overview of the valuation process, addressing issues specific to diminution in value in the context of fracking and similar incidences of environmental contamination. We will then explain the … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|Disclosing the Inevitable: Reconciling the Varied Requirements for the Disclosure of Death on Real Property|Hilary M Goldberg|2018|Notre Dame JL Ethics & Pub. Pol'y|32||183||Whether or not a property owner is required to disclose to prospective purchasers a death, felony, or other traumatic event on her real property depends, almost entirely, upon where the property is located. Indeed, while many fundamental aspects of Real Estate Law are consistent nationwide, the requirements imposed upon sellers to disclose a death or other psychological element affecting the property vary by state. The proliferation and success of websites, such as DiedInHouse. com, which, for a fee, will provide a report of all deaths that occurred on a particular property, suggest that consumers nationwide want to know whether there has been a death on the property. Countless stories of perpetually vacant homes following notable deaths and violent crimes reinforce this notion. Is there any way to reconcile the competing interests of the buyer who is sensitive to the stigma and the seller facing potential diminution … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|Stealing Time: The Propriety of Alleging Common Law Conversion in Modern Wage Theft Lawsuits|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg, Paul Silvia|2017||||||The words “wage theft” frequently make headlines when workers sue employers for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. Wage theft is “the illegal refusal by an employer to pay a worker the wages and benefits that he or she has legally earned.” In the United States, employer violation of wage and hour laws is a vast and enduring problem affecting as many as two-thirds of workers. In an attempt to combat this epidemic threat to hourly workers’ bottom lines, legislatures have fashioned numerous laws, some even invoking the power of “wage theft” terminology, such as New York’s Wage Theft Prevention Act. However, despite the pervasive usage of the term “wage theft” by the media, politicians, and pundits, a search of the term “wage theft” in legal libraries yields little precedent. This begs the question: can employers be liable for conversion for failing to compensate employees for time-spent working? The efficacy of conversion claims in wage-related lawsuits remains an unsettled question. However, if as a society, we are sounding the alarm in every incidence of possible wage and hour law violations, we ultimately misinform the population of potential plaintiffs regarding the viability of a claim for theft, or conversion, of earned yet unpaid wages.

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|When Does Compensation for'Time Spent Under the Employer's Control'Include Pre and Post Shift Waiting and Other Activities?|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg|2014/10/1|Southern Journal of Business & Ethics (October 2014)|||||In the face of continued economic uncertainly, employers are increasingly turning to temporary staffing to meet immediate workforce needs as a way of filling a current staffing gap without investing in a long-term commitment to an employee. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires that employers pay employees, including temporary employees, for all “hours worked,” so the question is what constitutes hours worked for the temporary worker? The answer generally comes down to “time spent under the employer’s control” but what does that mean? Does the employer need to exercise control over the employees’ choices, or just their actions? 
Chris Bolsmann |University ranking as social exclusion|Sarah S Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|2012/3/1|British journal of sociology of education|33|2|283-301|Routledge|In this article we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good' and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the … 
Chris Bolsmann |International student recruitment to universities in England: Discourse, rationales and globalisation|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|2008/3/1|Globalisation, Societies and Education|6|1|75-88|Routledge|The recruitment of international students to universities in England has become a central issue in an era of globalisation for university administrators, senior managers, international offices and heads of schools and faculties. We examine the policy rationales for the recruitment of international students to England. Through the use of in‐depth interviews with key role players at four English universities, we compare the rhetoric, rationales and reasons for the recruitment of international students. A range of discourses can be identified in the recruitment of international students and an economic competition rationale is dominant. This is expressed within the discourse of globalisation. 
Chris Bolsmann |Rationales, rhetoric and realities: FIFA’s World Cup in South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014|Bárbara Schausteck de Almeida, Chris Bolsmann, Wanderley Marchi Junior, Juliano de Souza|2015/5|International Review for the Sociology of Sport|50|3|265-282|SAGE Publications|The 2010 FIFA World Cup was heralded by mainstream media outlets, the local organisers, the South African government and FIFA as an unequivocal success. The month-long spectacle saw South Africa take centre stage and host the world’s largest single sporting event. This occurred against a backdrop of rationales and promises made that the event would leave lasting legacies for all, in particular marginalised South Africans. The reality is quite different. In this article we consider the South African World Cup in the build up to Brazil 2014. We argue that the rationales and rhetoric are similar in both countries and suggest the reality for Brazil 2014 will be the same as South Africa 2010 in that the mega-event will be primarily funded by significant public investment, while the primary beneficiaries will be private capital and FIFA.

Chris Bolsmann |Soccer, South Africa and celebrity status: Mark Fish, popular culture and the post‐apartheid state|Chris Bolsmann, Andrew Parker|2007/1/1|Soccer & Society|8|1|109-124|Routledge|The rise of celebrity culture is a theme that has attracted a significant amount of attention within both mainstream sociology and cultural studies in more recent times. Ensuing debate has identified contemporary sports figures as an important facet of the celebrity‐media nexus and as possible signifiers of cultural change. In this paper we take one particular sports celebrity, South African soccer star Mark Fish, and evaluate his image in relation to debates surrounding sport, politics and the post‐apartheid state. We argue that because Fish appears to enjoy all the benefits of celebrity status (within his home country at least), an analysis of his career and identity provide a useful means by which to think about the changing political and nationalistic values within South African society. 
Chris Bolsmann |White football in South Africa: Empire, apartheid and change, 1892–1977|Chris Bolsmann|2010/1/1|Soccer & Society|11|1-2|29-45|Routledge|This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more significant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth‐century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the first period under consideration (1892–1940s), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of …

Peter Alegi and Chris Bolsmann are well-known experts on South African football, and they have assembled an impressive team of local and international journalists, academics, and football experts to reflect on the 2010 World Cup and its broader significance, its meanings, complexities, and contradictions. The World Cup’s sounds, sights, and aesthetics are explored, along with questions of patriotism, nationalism, and spectatorship in Africa and around the world. Experts on urban design and communities write on how the presence of the World Cup worked to refashion urban spaces and negotiate the local struggles in the hosting cities. The volume is richly illustrated by authors’ photographs, and the essays in this volume feature chronicles of match day experiences; travelogues; ethnographies of fan cultures; analyses of print, broadcast, and electronic media coverage of the tournament; reflections on the World Cup’s private and public spaces; football exhibits in South African museums; and critiques of the World Cup’s processes of inclusion and exclusion, as well as its political and economic legacies. The volume concludes with a forum on the World Cup, including Thabo Dladla, Director of Soccer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Mohlomi Kekeletso Maubane, a well-known Soweto-based writer and a soccer researcher, and Rodney Reiners, former professional footballer and current chief soccer writer for the Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town.

Chris Bolsmann |Representation in the first African World Cup:‘world-class’, Pan-Africanism, and exclusion|Chris Bolsmann|2012/3/1|Soccer & Society|13|2|156-172|Routledge|This paper explores the representation of the first African World Cup in the British and South African press. Drawing on the output of a variety of media outlets between 2004, when South Africa was awarded the right to host the 2010 event, and the culmination of the tournament in July 2010, this paper contends that a range of representations of Africa have been put forward by the British and South African media. These can be interpreted as alarmist, sensationalist and even racist in certain extreme instances, and hypernationalist and overly defensive in other cases. 
Chris Bolsmann |The 1899 Orange Free State football team tour of Europe:‘Race’, imperial loyalty and sporting contest|Chris Bolsmann|2011/1/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|28|1|81-97|Routledge|In September 1899 an association football team from Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, South Africa, arrived in the United Kingdom. The team comprised 16 black South Africans who played under the auspices of the whites-only Orange Free State Football Association and was the first ever South African football team to tour abroad. In a four-month tour the team played 49 matches against opposition in England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. A small but growing body of work focuses on black sport and football in particular and the 1899 tour is referred to in passing in a few publications, although none have attempted to uncover details of the team or the matches that were played in Europe. This article attempts to do this by drawing on a range of sources in South Africa and the United Kingdom and argues the case for the significance of this team for football history in general and South African sports …

The Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) was founded in 1967 to provide Christian National education for white working-class Afrikaans-speaking students and its first vice-chancellor was a leading member of the Broederbond. Although this ethos tended to dominate university policy and practices until fairly recently, the university has at the same time been involved in innovations with regard to teaching since its inception. This paper focuses on recent changes that have taken place at RAU. It analyses the role of marketisation in facilitating changes in the student composition and forms of delivery in … 
Chris Bolsmann |South Africa and the global game: Introduction|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|2010/1/1|Soccer & Society|11|1-2|1-11|Routledge|On 10 May 1994, the festivities for Nelson Mandela’s presidential inauguration included a soccer match between South Africa and Zambia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. At halftime, Mandela’s helicopter landed on the pitch. As the president stepped out onto the grass, the huge crowd erupted in a thunderous roar. When play resumed, the South Africans seemed electrified and went on to win the match 2-1. On 15 May 2004 in Zurich, Switzerland, Mandela wept with joy when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) awarded South Africa the right to host the 2010 World Cup. South Africans celebrated in the streets as if they had not simply won hosting rights, but the World Cup itself!‘To some extent this outburst of euphoria surpassed 1994’, commented Ahmed Kathrada, the former political prisoner incarcerated with Mandela for 26 years;‘The scenes of jubilation, the spontaneous outpouring of …

We draw on in-depth interviews, archival materials and a range of press coverage. We argue that three broad overlapping themes are apparent in both case studies. These are the developmental rhetoric both hosts employ in the justification of holding the events in their respective countries. Mexico and South Africa convey a leadership role that stretches across the South American and African continent respectively. Finally, both countries argue that the legacy the respective tournament leaves is important. 
Chris Bolsmann |South African football tours at the turn of the twentieth century: Amateurs, pioneers and profits|Chris Bolsmann|2010/6/1|African Historical Review|42|1|91-112|Taylor & Francis Group|Academic and popular studies of South African sport generally reveal a bias towards cricket and rugby and this perpetuates the myth that these games are the most popular in South Africa. This in turn is often viewed through the lens of ‘race’ in which the simplifications of sport along racial lines occur. This paper argues that football was more important in South Africa among all South Africans in the late 19th and early 20th century than has been previously acknowledged. It reveals that not only was the game important and popular in South Africa but its teams and administrators played a significant role in globalising the game during this period. Tours to and from South Africa were important politically, financially and for sporting reasons. Five ground breaking football tours took place during a ten year period and these serve as the basis of discussion in this paper. 
Chris Bolsmann |From Apartheid to unity: White capital and black power in the racial integration of South African football, 1976–1992|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|2010/6/1|African Historical Review|42|1|1-18|Taylor & Francis Group|This article analyses the complex process that deracialised and democratised South African football between the early 1970s and 1990s. Based mainly on archival documents, it argues that growing isolation from world sport, exemplified by South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic movement in 1970 and FIFA in 1976, and the reinvigoration of the liberation struggle with the Soweto youth uprising triggered a process of gradual desegregation in the South African professional game. While Pretoria viewed such changes as a potential bulwark against rising black militancy, white football and big business had their own reasons for eventually supporting racial integration, as seen in the founding of the National Soccer League. As negotiations for a new democratic South Africa began in earnest between the African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP) in the latter half of the 1980s, transformations …

The American Cancer Society (ACS) is interested in facilitating colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) in primary care. Methods. Similar clinics were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 CRCS arms: (1) usual care, (2) exam-room posters designed by the ACS; and (3) posters plus patient reminder calls from an ACS volunteer. Results. Compared to patients due for screening in Arm 1, the odds ratio for getting CRCS in Arm 2 was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–1.34), P value not significant; in Arm 3, it was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.16–1.90), P value < .001. Conclusions. Exam-room posters plus patient reminder calls from the ACS can increase CRCS in primary care.

These and existing publications pay little or no attention to the emergence of white professional football in apartheid South Africa. The National Football League (NFL) challenged the amateur game and introduced professional football to the country. During its 17-year existence, the NFL grew each season with large attendances until its demise in 1977. In addition, the NFL imported a range of international players, invited foreign teams and actively engaged in the political debates in South African sport at the time. The NFL was instrumental in popularising the game across the country for all South Africans. The NFL became the most popular sports entertainment of choice for South Africans during this period. Finally, the NFL actively engaged in a campaign of destroying rival non-racial anti-apartheid leagues while …

In large measure, South Africa’s preparations for hosting the 2010 World Cup presented similar hurdles to those confronted by Mexico 40 years earlier. What I believe this comparative approach reveals is that the two countries not only shared common experiences as a result of having to stage mega-sports-events, but that their experiences show similarities explicitly because they were viewed as somehow falling short of expectations set by the ‘Western world’. Additionally, as we shall see, the rare opportunity afforded the two states in hosting these events fostered a fundamental debate within each country concerning projection of itself and its role in the … 
Chris Bolsmann |Trade-union internationalism and solidarity in the struggle against apartheid: A Case Study of Volkswagen|Chris Bolsmann|2007/4/1|Historical Studies in Industrial Relations||23-24|103-124|Liverpool University Press|By the 1970s, the struggle against apartheid had intensified within South Africa and abroad. Eddie Webster has argued that this struggle ‘became the moral equivalent of the Spanish civil war… with democrats, liberals, communists and concerned Christians united in common abhorrence of white domination’. 1 This article focuses on the trade-union internationalism and solidarity that emerged between South African and German trade-unionists in the fight against apartheid in a major German trans-national corporation (TNC). The relationships that developed in terms of the overlapping and convergence of economic, political and institutional interests that inform actions are studied. 2 Two distinct phases are identified. First, the emergence in the latter part of the 1970s of direct shop-floor and official links between South African and German trade-unionists, informed by the economic and institutional interests of the …

This examination of the impact of globalisation on the restructuring of public sector universities in South Africa in the 1990s demonstrates that the picture is far more complex. Over the last thirty years, globalisation has been intertwined with neoliberal capitalist economic and ideological restructuring. This is refracted, in the first instance, through State policy, and, in the second, through specific local sites of power relations and class struggles that are, in turn, structured by the resources and responses of different actors. While the neoliberal component of globalisation has played a decisive role in shaping State higher education policy in South Africa, the actual implementation of the model of the market-orientated university receiving minimal support from a deficit conscious State has … 
Chris Bolsmann |Contesting labor internationalism: The “old” trapped in the “new” in Volkswagen’s South African plant|Chris Bolsmann|2010/12|Labor Studies Journal|35|4|520-539|SAGE Publications|During the 1970s and 1980s, close linkages were established between unionists in Volkswagen’s Uitenhage plant in South Africa and Wolfsburg in Germany. The ensuing relationship resulted in trade union internationalism and solidarity with South African workers in their struggle against apartheid. After the insertion of the South African plant into the global production networks of the company, a range of new pressures and challenges confronted the union in South Africa. This resulted in the mass dismissal in 2000. In an attempt to garner international support and solidarity, the dismissed workers tapped into existing structures with no success, illustrating the reconfiguration of trade union internationalism away from worker interests to those of the unions and company. 
Chris Bolsmann |International student recruitment: South African rationales|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|2008|Journal of Higher Education in Africa/Revue de l'enseignement supérieur en Afrique|6|2-3|211-231|CODESRIA|In this paper, we focus on the rationales for the recruitment of international students to universities in South Africa. Through the use of in-depth interviews with international officers at a cross-section of South African universities, we argue that there are competing and complementary rationales for the recruitment of international students. Some South African universities follow international trends in terms of international student recruitment while others adopt a different approach. The analysis locates the rationales of international student recruitment as part of an internationalisation process within the context of globalisation.

These encounters were primarily on cricket pitches and rugby fields. After nearly four decades of negotiations the first Association football matches were played between the three countries in 1947. The first tour of South Africa to Australia and New Zealand was plagued by scandals on and off the pitch, but despite this Australia returned the favour and toured South Africa three years later. Another five years would pass before South African returned to Australia, by which time it was clear that a large gulf had emerged between the two nations in terms of sporting ability and organisational efficiency. This article focuses on the three tours of 1947, 1950 and 1955, dissecting each as they occurred against a backdrop of scandal, organisational inefficiency and sporting mismatch.

Indeed, so much so, that cricket has been identified by the Sports Council as a ‘focus sport’.6

In addition, sports such as cricket and rugby receive most attention. We argue that it is useful to consider other countries and sports engaged in apartheid South Africa. We consider Swedish engagement with apartheid South Africa and focus the case study of our analysis on the tour by champions Djurgården to the country in 1955. The tourists received favourable and widespread support in South Africa and Sweden. Yet towards the end of the tour sections of the Swedish press asked critical and probing questions of the club's tour to South Africa. We contend that the tour can be viewed as naïve and apolitical and in a similar vein to the organization of Swedish sports … 
Chris Bolsmann |The Outsourced University|Lucien Van der Walt, C Bolsman, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|1994||2001|||A survey of the rise of support service outsourcing in public sector higher education in South African and its effects on workers and trade unions|The “transformation” of the public sector universities in post-apartheid South Africa remains at the centre of government’s political commitments, policy formation processes, and public debate. 1 Yet one aspect of university restructuring has received surprisingly little attention: the trend towards the outsourcing of support service functions in the 1990s. Although the conflicts arising from this process caught the public eye on a number of occasions, most notably the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the support services at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2000, there has been no thorough study of the rise and effects of support service outsourcing in South Africa. The few studies that exist tend to be brief, sometimes journalistic, and generally confined to an examination of a single institution. By comparison, issues such as curriculum restructuring, university governance,“marketisation” and the proposed mergers and disestablishment of a number of institutions have been the subject of a great deal of public analysis, not to mention political conflict. 2 This paper provides an overview of the process of support service outsourcing across the public sector universities, and examines the effects of this process on workers and their trade unions. Our focus is on the period 1994 to 2001. By support services, we refer, in particular, to those manual and menial campus occupations that do not contribute directly towards knowledge production but which are, nonetheless, essential to the functioning of the universities. These occupations include catering, cleaning, grounds and building maintenance, security services and transport. The paper situates this … 
Chris Bolsmann |Taking South African sport seriously|Chris Bolsmann, Cora Burnett|2015/1/2||46|1|1-6|Routledge|Twenty years on, the image of Nelson Mandela, wearing the number six jersey of the white Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar, remains a poignant moment in South African and global sport. The 1995 Rugby World Cup victory by the overwhelmingly all-white Springboks remains a powerful symbol in post-apartheid South Africa. Clint Eastwood’s (2009) Hollywood film, Invictus, based on John Carlin’s Playing the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that made a nation (2008), has dramatised the significance of Mandela wearing the jersey and the South African victory. The formerly exclusive symbol was seemingly appropriated and made socially inclusive and became part of the lexicon and rhetoric of nation building post-1994. For Ashwin Desai (2010: 1), rugby had become ‘the sport that would help to catalyse the building of a “rainbow nation” predicated on a common identity, a common sense of “South …

Therefore, the 2010 edition of this event is used as analytical approach to reveal some of the rhetoric and strategic actions that permeated the context of its realization. Based on data obtained in the academic literature and media, we present that the motivations for the event were based on developmental discourses by both FIFA as well as local elites South African aiming to convince different social groups and conquer their support. However, the consequences are not necessarily those promised, and these institutions were the real benefciaries in their economic and political mutual interests. At this point, we argue that Brazilian society can and should learn from the experience of South Africa to assess critically the motives less apparent to host such events. Key-words: Mega-events.

Chris Bolsmann |Solidarity and Identity: Volkswagen Workers in South Africa and Germany|Chris Bolsmann|2006|Globalisation and new identities: A view from the middle|||137-55|Jacana Media|THE FOCUS OF this chapter is on worker identity within a trans-national corporation (TNC). This is related to international trade union solidarity, within Volkswagen AG'(VWAG). The connections between identity and solidarity are complex and the two ideas cannot be regarded as synonymous; rather they influence each other during two different periods under consideration. The chapter traces the 20 year relationship and solidarity displayed between the two trade unions organising in Germany and South Africa respectively, namely IG MetalP and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA). The first contact was initiated in the late 1970s and the ensuing links have developed over the last two decades. The central claim of this chapter is that two broad overlapping periods of interaction can be identified. The nature of these relations affects the forms of solidarity displayed by participants and the manner in which they relate to and interact with one another in terms of trade union internationalism. In the first section of this chapter, the analytical framework for understanding solidarity is explored. Solidarity is understood as action that benefits Volkswagen of South Africa (VWSA) employees and trade unionists and broader activity against the apartheid state. This is interpreted against the backdrop of a specific form of trade union internationalism during apartheid. In the second section, specific themes related to the above periods which emerged from semi structured in- 
Chris Bolsmann |White football in South Africa: empire, apartheid and change, 1892—1977|Chris Bolsmann|2013/10/18|South Africa and the Global Game: Football, Apartheid and Beyond|||29|Routledge|This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more signiﬁcant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth-century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the ﬁrst period under consideration (1892—19405), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of professionalism and antiapartheid organizations. In the ﬁnal phase (1967—77), ofﬁcials experimented with football on ‘multi-national’and multi-racial lines—a failed reform that led to the demise of white football. This essay traces the development, domination and decline of organized white football in South Africa. 1 It suggests that white football was more signiﬁcant and popular than generally acknowledged. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth-century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. 2 The objective of this analysis is to highlight three main periods of elite white football and reveal a number of contradictions along …

Chris Bolsmann |Review Essay on Peter Alegi, Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa|Chris Bolsmann|2006/4/1|Soccer & Society|7|2-3|292-299|Routledge|With the readmission of South African football into the international fold in 1992, a new phase began in the nation’s sporting history. In football, the euphoria continued with the national team winning the 1996 African Cup of Nations and participating in two World Cups in France in 1998 and Japan and South Korea in 2002. In addition to staging the 1996 African Cup of Nations, the most important football competition, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the country in 2010. Despite the abovementioned successes, relatively few studies have focussed on South African football. Mark Gleeson, South Africa’s foremost football writer and commentator, notes in his forward to the book Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa that ‘a general apathy with regard to the history of sport and its role in the development of South African society has ensured that this country does not possess a formal history of its football … 
Chris Bolsmann |Globalisation and the Outsourced University in South Africa|Lucien Van der Walt, C Bolsman, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2002/7|Final Report for CHET. University of Witwatersrand|||||The “transformation” of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has been a key focus of the new government’s reformist policy initiatives. On the one hand, the government has sought to break down racialised divisions in the sector between Historically Advantaged Institutions (HAIs) and Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs), to make the staff and student bodies more “representative” of the country as a whole, and to make the universities more accountable to its national and developmental priorities. On the other hand, government’s initiatives have taken place within the dual constraints of its own conservative macro-economic policy model, embodied in the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (GEAR), and the broader challenges imposed by neo-liberal globalisation. Within this context, the transformation of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has not proceeded in a smooth or monolithic manner. Rather, there have been many transformations, with different winners and losers, in the sector over the past decade, transformations shaped by the new global ideology of university “marketisation,” by the fiscal constraints of government’s macro-economic policy, by continued divisions between HAIs ands HDIs, and by divisions within universities by race and class and occupation. In this research paper, we examine one of these transformations: the restructuring and outsourcing of university support service functions in the 1990s. Even if some of the conflicts that have arisen from this process have caught the public eye-notably during the controversial restructuring of support services at the University of the … 
Chris Bolsmann |English Gentlemen and World Soccer: Corinthians, Amateurism and the Global Game|Chris Bolsmann, Dilwyn Porter|2018/4/19|||||Routledge|Association football is a global phenomenon. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), its governing body, currently has 211 countries in membership. In 2014, the sixty-four matches played by the thirty-two national teams competing in the final stages of the World Cup tournament in Brazil attracted a total attendance of almost 3.5 million spectators while reaching an estimated 2.1 billion television viewers worldwide.‘Soccer’, as we shall mostly call it so as to distinguish it from other forms of football, has come a long way from Kennington Oval, London, where the first international match was contested between England and Scotland in 1872 in front of 2,500 enthusiasts. 1 It was once commonplace to argue that it spread from Britain to the rest of the world by a relatively uncomplicated process

A Continental Spectacle?|Chris Bolsmann|2014/4/30||||372-388|Wallstein Verlag|The iconic image of former South African President Nelson Mandela holding the FIFA World Cup trophy is indelibly etched into the collective memory of football-loving South Africans and citizens across the globe. The photograph was taken at the headquarters of FIFA overlooking the city of Zurich on 15 May 2004. Mandela’s instantly recognisable smile adorned television screens and newspapers across the globe as FIFA announced that the hosts of the 2010 World Cup would be South Africa. 1 An African host was guaranteed the showpiece event after the controversial and contested decision to grant Germany the right to host the 2006 tournament. Despite South Africa being favourites to land the 2010 event, this was not guaranteed. The awarding of the 2010 event to South Africa was long-overdue recognition of Africa’s contribution to the world’s game. It represented an affirmation that an African host could stage … 
Chris Bolsmann |Sport and Post-Apartheid South Africa: Revisiting The Race Game|Chris Bolsmann|2014|Journal of Sport History|41|2|331-338|University of Illinois Press|In 1999, Douglas Booth’s The Race Game: Sport and Politics in South Africa was awarded the North American Society for Sport History book award. 1 The Race Game remains an essential text that considers sport and politics in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Twenty years on from the first free and fair democratic elections in South Africa, sport remains a useful lens, in terms of transformation and redress, through which to consider South African society more broadly. Booth noted early in The Race Game that “segregated sport was one of the most visible racial policies” in pre-1994 South Africa (p. 4). Issues of legislated discrimination and segregation no longer beset South African sport, yet race in sport remains an important component of South African society more broadly

Therefore, the 2010 edition of this event is used as analytical approach to reveal some of the rhetoric and strategic actions that permeated the context of its realization. Based on data obtained in the academic literature and media, we present that the motivations for the event were based on developmental discourses by both FIFA as well as local elites South African aiming to convince different social groups and conquer their support. However, the consequences are not necessarily those promised, and these institutions were the real beneficiaries in their economic and political mutual interests. At this point, we argue that Brazilian society can and should learn from the experience of South Africa south africa Subject Category: Geographic Entities

Consequently, before the 2010 World Cup, South Africa still remained a closed book to many. Only a few journalists and researchers have bucked the trend, writing about African football in its entirety. Before the World Cup, Peter Alegi, probably the foremost historian of African football, gathered a panel of journalists and researchers to discuss the significance of the World Cup for the African continent. Their comments in January 2010, as recorded here for this special FIFA World Cup 2010 edition of Ecquid Novi: African …

Chris Bolsmann |Three Clubs in Search of a City: Professional Soccer in Los Angeles, 1973–2018|Chris Bolsmann, George N Kioussis|2019/4/1|Journal of Sport History|46|1|98-114|University of Illinois Press|In 2016, Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) celebrated its birth before a public audience at Union Station. The club’s posturing on the day, and in its efforts more broadly, was that it offered the local market something new. Yet while the claim to originality was a tacit acknowledgment that the city had a footballing past, rarely has this past been explored in the relevant historiography. Thus, the founding of LAFC presents a timely moment to fill in the scholarly gap. This article uses LAFC as an entry point for exploring the contours of professional soccer in Los Angeles over the previous half-century. It follows three sides—the Los Angeles Aztecs, Los Angeles Galaxy, and Los Angeles Football Club—in their attempts to navigate the city’s built and sociocultural environment.

Though the original club appears to have had little impact on the way the game is played today, its characteristic style and tactics having been developed before the change in the offside law in 1925, some long-term influences are discernible in the continuing importance attached to sportsmanlike behaviour. While on tour in England but also in Europe, South Africa, the United States, Canada and Brazil, the Corinthians were effectively an advertisement for the patrician brand of soccer that they had offered in their late nineteenth-century heyday under ‘Pa’ Jackson. Overseas touring has been identified as one of the significant vectors through which soccer was …

In 1878, the DFA introduced a Challenge Cup competition, only seven years after the Football Association (FA) Challenge Cup had been first played for in England. 6 At the same time, soccer was growing in the north-eastern industrial centres of the United States, primarily Kearny and Harrison in New Jersey, Fall River and New Bedford in Massachusetts and Pawtucket in Rhode Island.

During his career, Jackson exhibited many of the qualities often attributed to entrepreneurs. He was an outsider, the son of a cheesemonger, who affected the gentility required to do business with the rich and famous; he was an opportunist who made connections between sports and sportsrelated activities to create new products; he was a publicist who recognized instinctively the value of a distinctive brand. Much of this was evident from the notice published in Football in October 1882, announcing the arrival of ‘A NEW ASSOCIATION CLUB’, open to ‘international and well-known players’, which would play on Wednesdays. Should anyone doubt the club’s credentials, there was …

Second, responses to the Corinthians, especially before 1914, were determined partly by the predisposition of key sections of the urban bourgeoisie in Northern and Central Europe to look favourably on all things English. It helped, of course, that soccer was ‘a game of the elite’in the countries that the Corinthians visited. 2 Sports tourism could be an especially congenial experience when the hosts were attentive, flattering and shared a common social background with their guests. Third, the host-visitor relationship was characterized at first by deference in that the tourists were expected to demonstrate excellence, which continental sides could not hope to match.

They represented ‘the cream of amateur talent’and were especially praised for their ‘ever-increasing missionary work’, taking the game ‘into places where first-class contests were otherwise impossible’. 1 Such comments testified to the efforts of Jackson, assisted by a generally sympathetic sporting press, to create and market the Corinthian brand in the late nineteenth century. Moreover, when he withdrew from active involvement in the club’s affairs in 1898, the founder could be confident that his legacy was in safe hands. The secretary’s role passed first to GO Smith and WJ Oakley until 1902, then to BO Corbett until 1904 and then to SH Day until 1906. Thereafter, it was taken on by WU Timmis, who saw the club through English soccer’s ‘Great Split’and the disruption caused by the war. Each of these sporting gentlemen had played for …

In this article, we consider association football tours between both countries from 1914 to 1955 against the backdrop of increased racism and segregation in South Africa and the anti-colonial movement in India. We draw from a range of sources, including archives, unpublished reports and newspaper articles. The sports tours helped to solidify relations between Indians in South Africa and India underpinning political, cultural, spiritual and emotional ties; they show how Indianness was forged among diasporans and that this was highly contested and constantly transformed in relation to external conditions; and they expose the racism on the part of white sporting organisations in particular and white politicians in general in South Africa.

Tours in the popular sport of cricket, football and rugby were very popular. These tours tested local opposition against foreign competition, brought in revenue to local and national sports associations and contributed to the development of a white South African identity. Austrian football teams were extensive travellers and popular attractions around the world. Prior to the Second World War Austrian football was highly regarded and was able to compete and hold its own against English and Scottish clubs and representative teams.

Chris Bolsmann |University rankings and the consolidation of elite networked institutions in an era of global capital|Sarah Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|2015/9/12||||||In this paper we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good’ and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the elite networked institutions of global capital. We conclude by arguing that, rather than regarding world university rankings as a means to establish criteria of educational value, the practice may be understood as an exclusionary one that furthers the alignment of higher education with neoliberal rationalities at both national and global levels. exclusion; higher education; knowledge society; neoliberalism; transnational capitalist class; university rankings

Upon closer scrutiny, the logic of the editors in incorporating such a varied input becomes clear, where they maintain (p. 5) that'we believe that the collection reflects the spirit of Seattle'. What unfolds in the 14 chapters is a very useful compilation that attempts to locate the role of labour within an era of globalization and, at the same time, branches out to other social actors within diverse contexts. In so doing, the book offers possible ways forward for labour, and simultaneously presents a useful critique of existing internationalism and highlights potential pitfalls for new endeavours.

These works.accept that a revival of labour internationalism is occurring, and they attempt to map ways forward for the labour movement and trade unionism. Broad overlapping streams can be identified that attempt to locate the possibilities for labour in an era of globalisation. These include theorists who argue for global social movement unionism and its derivatives, those who position their analysis within international political economy, some who call for the restructuring of global governance, those who argue for new networks, and finally, those who call for the re-politicisation of the labour movement. Rather than arguing for one best way, the conclusions drawn from this review maintain that a multi-faceted approach, which continues to revive labour and strengthen its position and … 
Chris Bolsmann |SOCIOLOGY OF WORK UNIT (SWOP)|Lucien van der Walt, Chris Bolsmann, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2002/8||||||The “transformation” of public sector universities in post-apartheid South Africa remains at the centre of government’s political commitments, policy formation processes, and public debate. 1 Yet one aspect of university restructuring has received surprisingly little attention: the trend towards the outsourcing of support services functions in the 1990s. Although the conflicts arising from this process caught the public eye on a number of occasions, most notably the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the support services at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2000, there has been no thorough study of the rise and effects of support services outsourcing in South Africa. The few studies that exist tend to be brief, sometimes journalistic, and generally confined to an examination of a single institution. By comparison, issues such as curriculum restructuring, university governance,“marketisation” and the proposed …

Chris Bolsmann |La solidaridad y el internacionalismo sindical en la lucha contra el Apartheid|Chris Bolsmann, Yunersy Legorburo Ibarra||||||El Colegio de México, Centro de Estudios de Asia y África|En este artículo se examinan la solidaridad y el internacionalismo sindical. Con mayor precisión, se trata de una investigación acerca de las relaciones que surgieron durante los años setenta entre trabajadores sudafricanos y alemanes y dirigentes sindicales de una compañía; a saber, Volkswagen. Por medio del análisis de las relaciones identificadas durante el apartheid, se estudia cómo se traslapan y convergen los intereses económicos, políticos e institucionales; al mismo tiempo, se reconocen los intereses de los protagonistas. Este artículo examina cómo esos intereses, a su vez, fueron capaces de influir en la solidaridad y el inter-nacionalismo sindical. Se consideran dos fases en la solidaridad y el internacionalismo. La primera analiza el surgimiento de vínculos laborales directos entre trabajadores sudafricanos y alemanes, por un lado, y dirigentes sindicales, por el otro, en la última parte de la década …

Ovande Furtado Jr. |Influence of exercise intensity on the decision-making performance of experienced and inexperienced soccer players|Fabio E Fontana, Oldemar Mazzardo, Comfort Mokgothu, Ovande Furtado Jr, Jere D Gallagher|2009/4|Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology|31|2|135-151||The aim of this study was to examine the decision-making performance of experienced and inexperienced soccer players at four exercise intensities (rest, 40%, 60%, and 80% maximal aerobic power). The decision-making performance of inexperienced players was expected to demonstrate an inverted-U shape with increasing levels of exercise. For the experienced players, decision making was predicted to show no change in performance with increased exercise intensity. Thirty-two adult soccer players (16 experienced, 16 inexperienced) were asked to answer seven decision-making questions as quickly and accurately as possible for each exercise intensity. Results indicated that exercise does not affect the accuracy of decision making; however, the speed of decision making for experienced and inexperienced players improved with increased exercise intensity. These results suggest that physiologically … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Anti-fat bias among physical education teachers and majors|Fabio Eduardo Fontana, Ovande Furtado, Ripley Marston, Oldemar Mazzardo, Jere Gallagher|2013|Physical Educator|70|1|15|Sagamore Publishing LLC|Obesity has reached epidemic levels, and physical education teachers are on the front lines to combat it. However, anti-fat bias from physical education teachers may be a barrier against the participation of students who are obese in physical activity. Thus, our purpose was to investigate the attitude of physical education teachers and majors toward obese individuals. Fortyseven physical education teachers and 149 majors participated in the study. Participants answered three questionnaires: Anti-Fat Attitude Scale (AFAS measures explicit attitudes toward obese individuals), Perception of Obese Students by Physical Education Teachers questionnaire (POSPET measures how teachers perceive students who are obese during class), and Implicit Association Test (IAT is a timed assessment measuring automatic attitudes toward obese individuals through word categorizations: good-bad, lazymotivated).

Ovande Furtado Jr. |Whole and part practice: A meta-analysis|Fabio E Fontana, Oldemar Mazzardo, Ovande Furtado Jr, Jere D Gallagher|2009/10|Perceptual and motor skills|109|2|517-530|Ammons Scientific, Ltd.|Motor learning textbooks provide specific recommendations for the use of whole and part practice during motor skill acquisition. Magill recommended basing decisions on Naylor and Briggs' hypothesis of task complexity and organization, while Schmidt and Wrisberg recommended basing decisions on skill classification. To evaluate the accuracy of these recommendations, a meta-analysis was conducted. Through a literature search, 44 articles were located, and 20 provided sufficient information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were calculated using means for whole and part practice for acquisition and retention. Although several analyses were compromised by insufficient studies investigating whole and part practice, mean effect sizes generally supported motor learning textbooks. To better verify the empirical validity of recommendations for the use of whole and part practice, more studies are necessary.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of professors in physical education departments toward obese individuals. Professors from randomly selected institutions across all four US regions participated in the study (N = 94). Participants took the Implicit Association Test and answered the Anti-Fat Attitude Scale and two questions specifically designed to measure their attitudes toward physical education teachers and majors who are obese. The participants exhibited implicit good–bad (p < .001) and lazy–motivated (p < .001) anti-fat biases. Professors favored accepting majors who are obese (p < .001), but they strongly disapproved of obese physical education teachers as role models to their students (p < .001). Explicit anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of …

To master FMS, performance evaluation is necessary. In this study, we investigated the reliability of a new observational assessment tool. In Phase I, 110 video clips of children performing five locomotor, and six manipulative FMSs were developed. In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51–.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged. This study sets the foundation for the development of a new observational scale to assess fundamental movement skills.

This study’s goals were to determine whether (a) RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants and (b) academic timing , in which academic status determines age groupings more than strict age guidelines for college sports, influenced the formation of RAE. Participants were 150 junior college baseball players. Our results showed that RAE was only a significant factor, comparing the birth distribution of participants born before and after the midpoint of the participation year, when academic timing was also a factor in determining age groupings. In addition, the birth rate distribution, though not significantly different than expected, was greater … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Relationship between fundamental movement skills and body mass index in rural elementary age children|Mariah L Bolin|2013||||||A factor of how much physical activity a child gets could be determined by the level of mastery of fundamental movement skills that are needed for the establishment of skills used in many forms of adult physical activity. Children who master a number of fundamental movement skills are more likely to be physically active and they also may be more likely to take part in physical activity when being compared to peers with a lesser level of motor skill proficiency. Children who are considered overweight tend to engage less often in physical activities, which in turn may prevents them from acquiring fundamental movements skills. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and fundamental movement skills in children ages 5 to 7 in a rural school system. The following two research questions were formulated: Does the performance of locomotor and manipulative … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Furtado-Gallagher Movement Skill Assessment: Collecting evidence for content-related validity|Ovande Furtado|2004/12/15||||||The National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) emphasizes in its second edition of the National Standards for Physical Education the importance of linking instruction and assessment in physical education. NASPE standards reflect what students should know and be able to do as a result of a quality physical education (NASPE, 2004). This link is even more beneficial to students and teachers alike when assessment is aligned with the NASPE content standards. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a criterion-referenced assessment tool to test movement concepts and fundamental movement skills of children ages 3 through 10 and provide evidence for content-related validity. An attempt was made to develop an assessment tool that is tied closely to the postulates of the National Standards for Physical Education (NASPE, 2004). The gathering of evidence for content-related validity was accomplished through judgments of a panel of 20 content experts (professors = 8; and PE teachers = 12). An Internet-based item review form was used to collect information from experts. Experts rated content at item level (31 items divided in 7 categories) using a four point likert-type scale where 1 being 'not important at all' and 4 'very important'. Content was also rated at test level (7 questions) addressing the match between the test content and the test general characteristics (e.g., match between the proposed set of items and the test purpose). This set of questions were rated on a five point likert-type scale with 1 being 'poor' and 5 being 'excellent'. Many of the expert reviewers also provided written feedback on the content of the … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |The relationship of movement skills with habitual and organized physical activity in seven and eight-year-old children|Oldemar Mazzardo, Fábio Eduardo Fontana, Ovande Furtado, Jere D Gallagher|2018/3/29|Pensar a Prática|21|1|||PURPOSE: To verify the association of motor skills with habitual and organized PA participation, and sedentary behavior for males and females. METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls. 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Investigating expert-rater agreement and inter/intra-rater reliability of two fundamental movement skills for the locomotor subscale of the FG-COMPASS|Lino Perez|2018||||||The Furtado-Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS) is an observational rating scale using sequential decisions to assess fundamental movement skills. The current version of the test has 3 locomotor and 5 manipulative skills. This study aimed to assess expert-rater agreement and inter/intra rater reliability of two new scales to be added to the locomotor subtest. This study was divided into two phases. In Phase I, 60 children between the ages of 5 and 10 were filmed performing the skills of galloping and vertical jumping. An expert in motor behavior classified the videotapes using the newly created rating scales. Next, 8 video clips were selected for training purposes and 24 video clips for testing purposes. In Phase II, 30 undergraduate and graduate students served as raters and underwent a training session prior the testing session. Participants were instructed not to classify the video clips based on the apparent age of the children as skill levels were distributed across all age levels. Further, to avoid guessing, participants were not told how many videos of each level they would be rating. Unlike the training sessions, participants did not receive feedback during testing sessions. Weighted kappa (Kw) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were used to analyze data. Results suggested a “very good” agreement between expert and rater consensus for vertical jumping (Kw = .96) and galloping (Kw=.89) and an “excellent” agreement for vertical jump (ICC = .98) and galloping (ICC = .95). Inter-rater reliability resulted in “very good” agreement for vertical jumping (Kw=.92) and a “good …

Thus, the accurate and reliable measurement of FMS is of related importance. This article presents the results of two studies intended to assess expert-rater agreement and inter-/intrarater scoring reliability in the administration of a new observational FMS instrument, the Furtado–Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS).

Ovande Furtado Jr. |The Relative Age Effect and Academic Timing in College Baseball|Thomas Beals, Jr. Furtado, Ovande.|2012||||A32|Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|Background/Purpose Previous research has suggested that older athletes within the same age grouping are often perceived to be more talented simply due to advanced maturity. This perception leads to biased selection and skewed participation rates favoring the oldest participants within the group. This resulting skewed distribution is termed Relative Age Effect (RAE). Further, academic institutions often group their participants according to their academic status, not strictly by age. This factor, termed Academic Timing, can result in the ages of competitors spanning more than a single calendar year. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate whether RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants, and study whether Academic Timing influences the formation of RAE.

Andrew Linden |Disrupting dominant discourses:# HERESPROOF of interest in women's sports|Dunja Antunovic, Andrew D Linden|2015/1/2|Feminist Media Studies|15|1|157-159|Routledge|Feminist sport scholars have observed the underrepresentation and misrepresentation of women athletes and women’s sports in media with great concern (Cheryl Cooky, Michael A. Messner, and Robin Hextrum 2013). Scholars have attributed this drought to decision making: national surveys indicate that industry leaders in sports media operate under the assumption that their readers, viewers, and listeners are not interested in women’s sports (Marie Hardin 2005; Marie Hardin, Dunja Antunovic, Steve Bien-Aimé, and Roubing Li 2013). To challenge this assumption, in November 2013, the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota launched a social media initiative titled the# HERESPROOF Project. The Tucker Center encourages Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook users to post photos from girls’ and women’s sporting events and to attach the “HERESPROOF Seal” to … 
Andrew Linden |From Ladies' Days to Women's Initiatives: American Pastimes and Distaff Consumption|Jaime Schultz, Andrew D Linden|2014/1/22|The International Journal of the History of Sport|31|1-2|156-180|Routledge|American entrepreneurs have, for more than a century, sought to cultivate female consumers of national pastimes, specifically horse racing, boxing, baseball, football and basketball. Because these sports have been principally and historically associated with manliness and masculinity, it is more appropriate to think in terms of women's involvement and consumption, as opposed to their athletic participation when it comes to ‘pastime' status. Marketing campaigns aimed at women by the promoters of national pastimes reveal complex processes of commercialisation, bourgeoisification and hypercommodification. The ways in which major sports leagues and administrators appealed to women have long been based on essentialised feminine roles, treating women as moralising agents, wives and mothers, and consumers. These strategies represent the primary force in shaping women's inclusion in national pastimes. In … 
Andrew Linden |Revolution on the American Gridiron: Gender, contested space, and women’s football in the 1970s|Andrew D Linden|2015/12/12|The International Journal of the History of Sport|32|18|2171-2189|Routledge|Scholarship on the 1970s ‘women’s movement’ in the USA has grown in recent years. However, this area has yet to fully incorporate women’s athletic experiences. This paper brings together these two areas of scholarship through analysis of women’s experiences playing professional football in 1970s America. Women athletes articulated little connection between football and the larger feminist campaign for corporeal autonomy and equality and some pronounced a distinctly antifeminist identity. My intent is not to force the feminist mantle on these women or to contest their self-descriptions. Rather, I seek to locate their experiences within the larger women’s movement using historian Anne Enke’s idea of ‘contested space’ (Finding the Movement, 2007). Drawing on interviews with 13 women on three different teams during the 1970s, I argue that while women football players did not explicitly align with the feminist … 
Andrew Linden |Tempering the Dichotomous Flame: Social History, Cultural History, and Postmodernism(s) in the Journal of Sport History, 1974–2014|Andrew D Linden|2016/4/1|Journal of Sport History|43|1|66-82|University of Illinois Press|In the June 2014 issue of the Journal of American History, which includes a forum titled “State of the Field: Sports in American History,” Amy Bass argues that, as many humanities-based disciplines adopted tenets of cultural history, sport history did not. Based on over a decade of debate about social, cultural, and postmodernist paradigms, Bass's assertion illuminates continuing historiographical arguments about epistemology and theory in sport history. In this article, I respond to these discussions by analyzing 405 full-length articles in the Journal of Sport History from the first issue in 1974 through the end of 2014. Drawing on philosopher R. Scott Kretchmar's caution against “dualisms [and] dichotomies” in sport scholarship, I argue for a holistic understanding of sport history, rather than the dichotomous historiography present over the past decade. 
Andrew Linden |Heat-Related Deaths in American Football: An Interdisciplinary Approach|Jaime Schultz, W Larry Kenney, Andrew D Linden|2014/11|Sport History Review|45|2|123-144||As observers of American football turn their attention to the crises of concussions, subconcussive hits, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and attendant issues related to direct contact and collision, it may be easy to lose track of the too frequent occurrence of what experts refer to as a type of “indirect” fatality caused by “systemic failure as a result of exertion”: those associated with heat. 1 Typically brought about by engaging in intense physical effort in hot and humid conditions, the vast majority of these deaths need not occur. Despite the growing scientific understanding of the problem, however, heat-related deaths persist, often surging at different points in history. It is not just an issue of science, then, but also an issue of culture and one that necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. Physicians have documented heat-related deaths in football since the early twentieth century, but it was the 2001 death of the … 
Andrew Linden |Looking at Losing: Presentations of the Media's Narrative of the Cleveland Browns’ Relocation|Andrew D Linden|2012/12/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|29|18|2575-2598|Taylor & Francis Group|On November 6, 1995, Art Modell announced his intention to relocate the National Football League's (NFL) Cleveland Browns to Baltimore following the season. After 4 months of civic activism from Cleveland's community and legal action from the city's politicians, Cleveland, the NFL and Modell agreed to a deal that allowed the long-time owner to honour his contract with Baltimore and simultaneously provided a NFL club to Cleveland to begin play in 1999. This settlement was unique because it allowed Cleveland to retain the naming rights, colours, logo and, most significantly, the history of the Browns. Media presentations of Modell's announcement during the 4-month period illuminated a complex symbiotic relationship between the press, the public and sports entrepreneurs. The local media castigated and vilified Modell for betraying Cleveland's community and disturbing the city's supposed ‘renaissance’, while … 
Andrew Linden |Writing sport online: An analysis of the pitfalls and potential of academic blogging|Andrew D Linden, Lindsay Parks Pieper|2017/7/1|Journal of Sport History|44|2|257-274|University of Illinois Press|Opportunities abound for scholars' digital engagement. Among the numerous available technologies, blogging has emerged as a medium that presents both opportunities and challenges for academics. Although scholars have reflected on the values and drawbacks of blogging in academia, few have specifically analyzed academic sport blogs. This paper uses a content analysis of six sport-specific online forums to examine the composition of contributors and the content of posts, as well as the pitfalls and potential of academic sport blogging. Our analysis suggests that, while blogging offers novel opportunities for scholars, the forum simultaneously reifies problems already present in sport scholarship and academia. 
Andrew Linden |Blue-Collar Identity and the" Culture of Losing": Cleveland and the" Save Our Browns" Campaign|Andrew D Linden|2015/10/18|Journal of Sport History|42|3|340-0360|University of Illinois Press|In November 1995, Cleveland football fans began the "Save Our Browns" campaign after owner Art Modell announced he would move the team to Baltimore after the season. By February 1996, the initiative influenced the National Football League's decision to allow Cleveland to keep the legacy of the Browns and offer the city a new team. Letters found at the Pro Football Hall of Fame show how the Save Our Browns campaign illuminated a "culture of losing"–the combination of a declining city, poor sports teams, and angst from social change–in the greater Cleveland community. I argue that Clevelanders' fight for the Browns represented their desire for a Cleveland of the past that included an idealized blue-collar identity consisting of expressions of heteronormative, white masculinity. These expressions show how some considered sports more important than other forms of social change in the Rust Belt city in the … 
Andrew Linden |Political Football: Social Movements and the Professional Gridiron in the United States, 1955-1979|Andrew David Linden|2016/8/26||||||Politics and political movements appeared in professional football since the sport emerged. However, because the National Football League (NFL) was not yet popular across the country, these issues had little effect on the broader culture. In the second half of the century, the NFL became the most popular consumer sport in the country. Conflicts between labor and capital, between men and women, between races and ethnicities, and between groups associated with the broader counterculture and liberation movements were brought by political advocates into the sport. Nonetheless, throughout this same time, the league had political priorities of its own and endorsed certain political issues while not engaging others. In this dissertation, I utilize a “multiple histories” approach to analyze the effect of social movements on the NFL and demonstrate the influence of political football in American culture. To do so, I examine how four social movements (Civil Rights, the New Left and counterculture, labor, and the women’s movement) intersected with professional football from the late 1950s through the 1970s. League representatives had varying reactions each time a social movement appeared on the gridiron. For example, some team owners and coaches supported black athletes fighting to desegregate the game and other areas of society through non-violent protest, but they reacted to the broader Civil Rights Movement by reaffirming notions of white supremacy. While league marketers promoted athletes who endorsed the Vietnam War and other “patriotic” efforts to defeat communism, they avoided engaging with critics (particularly if they were players …

Andrew Linden |LT: The Life & Times dir. by Peter Radovich|Andrew D Linden|2015||42|2|230-231|University of Illinois Press|In an era when controversy continuously casts a negative shadow over the National Football League, memories of past American football greats historicize a league that has grappled with athletes’ personal troubles and larger social issues. In LT: The Life & Times, Showtime Sports presents a narrative of one of the sport’s legends, who, like many players today, faced troubles off the gridiron. As former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor—colloquially known as “LT”—states at the beginning of the nearly two-hour documentary,“As easy as football is to me... is as hard as life is to me.” Indeed, LT was a dynamic gridiron star. After his playing college football at the University of North Carolina, the New York Giants drafted LT with the second overall pick in the 1981 NFL draft. He immediately impacted the team, winning both the Defensive Rookie of the Year and overall Defensive Player of the Year awards in his …

After the gymnasium trainers tried and failed, Galen properly diagnosed himself, treated himself for forty days and fully recovered. He also writes about a youthful wrestler injured by a blow to the sternum. When others could not help him, an abscess formed and the youth might have died, but Galen excised the diseased sternum and the youth survived. News of Galen’s expertise reached Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appointed Galen personal physician to his heir Commodus. Galen also received an imperial salary for preparing Aurelius’ daily potion of theriac (a mixture of over sixty ingredients from viper flesh to opium), which supposedly helped the emperor sleep. Despite losing many of his writings in a fire in 192, Galen continued to write and treat patients well into his old age. Readers … 
Andrew Linden |A Brief Taxonomy of Sports that Were Not Quite American National Pastimes: Fads and Flashes-in-the-Pan, Nationwide and Regional Pastimes, the Pastimes of Other Nations, and Pan …|Jaime Schultz, Dunja Antunovic, Adam Berg, Justine Kaempfer, Andrew D Linden, Thomas Rorke, Colleen English, Mark Dyreson|2014/1/22|The International Journal of the History of Sport|31|1-2|250-272|Routledge|Several sports have served as American national pastimes over the course of the nation's history. Horse racing, hunting, prize fighting, baseball, football, and basketball have waxed and waned in a long series of debates over what constitutes ‘true' national pastimes. Unlike some nations that have declared national pastimes by governmental fiat, US national games emerge from organic and sometimes chaotic cultural processes. An alternative history of sports that have become popular and widespread national habits but have not quite become national pastimes sheds important light on what national pastimes are and how they have developed in American history. A variety of pretenders to the title of national pastime have come and gone. These challengers can be categorised as fads and flashes-in-the-pan, nationwide and regional pastimes, the pastimes of other nations, and pan-national pastimes. An … 
Andrew Linden |Sportista: female fandom in the United States|Andrew D Linden|2013/10/8||16|9|1213-1216|Routledge|Andrei S. Markovits and Emily K. Albertson’s Sportista: Female Fandom in the United States analyzes the often stereotyped female fan of big-time sports in the USA. Markovits has produced a considerable amount of scholarship on comparative sport culture in both the USA and Europe. Albertson, an undergraduate at the University of Michigan at the time of writing, clearly identifies herself as one of the female fans studied in Sportista. Together the two authors examine ‘the woman who not only loves her sports but also knows them’and who ‘distinguishes herself from most of her world by being immensely passionate and knowledgeable about sports’(p. 5). Coining the term ‘sportista’–from the feminine term ‘fashionista’–Markovits and Albertson argue that women have crafted a distinctive identity as fans of ‘the hegemonic sports cultures’ in the USA (p. 5). While sportistas know a plethora of sporting information, the … 
Andrew Linden |Money Games: Profiting from the Convergence of Sports and Entertainment by David M Carter|Andrew D Linden|2013||40|2|334-335|University of Illinois Press|The business of sports and entertainment rapidly expanded in the last half of the twentieth century. According to David M. Carter, the convergence of sports and entertainment “has been relatively contained” and primarily occurred “in and around sports venues”(p. 1). Today, this convergence is “borderless” and “pervasive,” and it “continues to create business challenges while simultaneously providing significant opportunities for those hoping to make money from it”(p. 1). In essence, Carter claims that sports have become synonymous with entertainment. For example, his analysis of the burgeoning “poker boom”(p. 150) astutely reifies the notion that there is a hazy demarcation point between sports and entertainment. Carter thus focuses on stakeholders, who have monetized the convergence, and offers recommendations for future entrepreneurs about ways in which to profit from the burgeoning industry. Carter … 
Andrew Linden |The Cultural Nexus of Sport and Business: The Relocation of the Cleveland Browns|Andrew D Linden|2012||||||On November 6, 1995, Arthur Modell announced his intention to transfer the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore after the conclusion of the season. Throughout the ensuing four months, the cities of Cleveland and Baltimore, along with Modell, National Football League (NFL) officials and politicians, battled over the future of the franchise. After legal and social conflicts, the NFL and Cleveland civic officials agreed on a deal that allowed Modell to honor his contract with Baltimore and simultaneously provided an NFL team to Cleveland to begin play in 1999. This settlement was unique because it allowed Cleveland to retain the naming rights, colors, logo, and, most significantly, the history of the Browns.

It is unknown how elderly individuals behave during prolonged standing and how demanding such a task is for them. We recorded the center of pressure (COP) position of 14 elderly subjects and 14 adults while they performed prolonged standing (30 min) and quiet stance tasks (60 s) on a force plate. The number and amplitude of the COP patterns, the root mean square (RMS), speed, and frequency of the COP sway were analyzed. The elderly subjects were able to stand for prolonged periods but they produced postural changes of lesser amplitude and a decreased sway during the prolonged standing task. Both the adults and the elderly subjects were influenced by the prolonged standing task, as demonstrated by their increased COP RMS and COP speed in the quiet …

Paulo Marchetti |Propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a biomechanical study|Andre Serra Bley, Joao Carlos Ferrari Correa, Amir Curcio Dos Reis, Nayra Deise Dos Anjos Rabelo, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucareli|2014/5/15|PloS one|9|5|e97606|Public Library of Science|Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF …

Paulo Marchetti |Effects of the pullover exercise on the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles as evaluated by EMG|Paulo H Marchetti, Marco C Uchida|2011/11|Journal of applied biomechanics|27|4|380-384||The aim of the current study was to investigate the EMG activity of pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles during the pullover exercise. Eight healthy male volunteers took part in the study. The EMG activity of the pectoralis major and that of the latissimus dorsi of the right side were acquired simultaneously during the pullover exercise with a free-weight barbell during both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement. After a warm-up, all the subjects were asked to perform the pullover exercise against an external load of 30% of their body weight, during 1 set × 10 repetitions. The criterion adopted to normalize the EMG data was the maximal voluntary isometric activation. The present findings demonstrated that the barbell pullover exercise emphasized the muscle action of the pectoralis major more than that of the latissimus dorsi, and the higher activation depended on the external force lever arm …

We compared muscle fatigue and recovery time between 2 representative muscles: the middle deltoid and the quadriceps femoris. METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with COPD (FEV1 46.1 ± 10.3% of predicted) underwent maximal voluntary isometric contraction and an endurance test (60% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction, to the limit of tolerance). The maximal voluntary isometric contraction test was repeated after 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 24 hours for both the quadriceps femoris and middle deltoid. Surface electromyography was recorded throughout the endurance test. RESULTS: Maximal voluntary isometric contraction significantly decreased only for the middle deltoid between …

Ten physical active participants were evaluated during this study. All subjects were familiarized with the isometric squat position in all conditions: without and with knee wrap (hard and soft stiffness). The squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric squat contractions in 3 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with soft knee wrap (SKW) and with hard knee wrap (HKW). The peak of force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions WKW and HKW (P= 0.029, ES= 1.27, Δ%= 22%]) and WKW and SKW (P= 0.038, ES= 1.20, Δ%= 21%]). The use of the knee wrap under the presented conditions seem to increase the maximal isometric force during the squat exercise, independent of the level of stiffness of the knee wrap.

Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. 
Paulo Marchetti |Muscle Activation Differs between Three Different Knee Joint-Angle Positions during a Maximal Isometric Back Squat Exercise|P.H. MARCHETTI, J.J. DA SILVA, B.J. SCHOENFELD, P.S.M NARDI, A.C. ALONSO, J.M.D GREVE, E.H. HARTIGAN|2016|Journal of Sports Medicine|2016||1-7||The purpose of this study was to compare muscle activation of the lower limb muscles when performing a maximal isometric back squat exercise over three different positions. Fifteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men performed an isometric back squat at three knee joint angles (20°, 90°, and 140°) in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activation of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), and gluteus maximus (GM). In general, muscle activity was the highest at 90° for the three quadriceps muscles, yet differences in muscle activation between knee angles were muscle specific. Activity of the GM was significantly greater at 20° and 90° compared to 140°. The BF and ST displayed similar activation at all joint angles. In conclusion, knee position alters muscles activation of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles. An isometric back squat at 90° generates the highest overall muscle activation, yet an isometric back squat at 140° generates the lowest overall muscle activation of the VL and GM only. 
Paulo Marchetti |Can the technique of knee wrap placement affect the maximal isometric force during back squat exercise?|P.H. MARCHETTI, V.J.P MATOS, E.G SOARES, J.J. SILVA, E.P. SERPA, D.A. CORRÊA, G. MARTINS, G.B. VILELA JUNIOR, W.A. GOMES|2015|International Journal of Sports Science|5|1|16-18|SAP|The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects on maximal isometric force with two different techniques of knee wraps placement (spiral and X) during back squat exercise. Twenty-one physical active participants were evaluated during this study. The back squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric back squat contractions in 4 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with spiral knee wrap technique (SKW), with X knee wrap technique (XKW) and tensor (T). The peak force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was evaluated after each trial and condition. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions SKW vs WKW (P= 0.044, ES= 0.55, Δ%= 10.8%), and XKW vs WKW (P= 0.009, ES= 0.62, Δ%= 13.6%). The use of different knee wrap techniques (spiral and X techniques) presented an effective carry-over effect, but without differences between techniques, and the RPE was similar in all conditions.

Paulo Marchetti |The Effects of Uni-and Bilateral Fatigue on Postural and Power Tasks|Paulo H Marchetti, Maria IV Orselli, Marcos Duarte|2013|Journal of Applied Biomechanics 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc|29|1|44-48|Human Kinetics, Inc|The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of unilateral and bilateral fatigue on both postural and power bipedal tasks. Ten healthy subjects performed two tasks: bipedal quiet standing and a maximal bipedal counter-movement jumping before and after unilateral (with either the dominant or nondominant lower limb) and bilateral (with both lower limbs) fatigue. We employed two force plates (one under each lower limb) to measure the ground reaction forces and center of pressure produced by subjects during the tasks. To quantify the postural sway during quiet standing, we calculated the resultant center of pressure (COP) speed and COP area of sway, as well as the mean weight distribution between lower limbs. To quantify the performance during the countermovement jumping, we calculated the jump height and the peak force of each lower limb. We observed that both unilateral and bilateral fatigue … 
Paulo Marchetti |Selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle during low-intensity and fatiguing tasks|Paulo H Marchetti, André F Kohn, Marcos Duarte|2011/6|Journal of sports science & medicine|10|2|322|Dept. of Sports Medicine, Medical Faculty of Uludag University|In order to understand the potential selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: the curl up (supine trunk raise) and the leg raise (supine bent leg raise) at low intensity (in which only a few motor units are recruited). In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a certain force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the lower and upper portions of the rectus abdominis muscle during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG intensities of the upper and lower portions during the curl up exercise was significantly larger than during the leg raise exercise (p= 0.02). A cross-correlation analysis … 
Paulo Marchetti |Effect of Resistance Training Frequency on Neuromuscular Performance and Muscle Morphology after Eight Weeks in Trained Men.|Felipe Alves Brigatto, Tiago Volpi Braz, TCDC Zanini, Moisés Diego Germano, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Brad Jon Schoenfeld, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Charles Ricardo Lopes|2019|Journal of strength and conditioning research|||||The purpose of this study was to investigate the chronic effects of training muscle groups 1 day per week vs. 2 days per week on neuromuscular performance and morphological adaptations in trained men with the number of sets per muscle group equated between conditions. Participants were randomly assigned in 2 experimental groups: 1 session· wk per muscle group (G1, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained once a week with 16 sets or 2 sessions· wk per muscle group (G2, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained twice a week with 8 sets per session. All other variables were held constant over the 8-week study period. No significant difference between conditions for maximal strength in the back squat or bench press, muscle thickness in the elbow extensors, elbow flexors, or quadriceps femoris, and muscle endurance in the back squat and bench press performed at 60% 1RM was detected. Effect size favored G2 for some outcome measurements, suggesting the potential of a slight benefit to the higher training frequency. In conclusion, both G1 and G2 significantly enhance neuromuscular adaptations, with a similar change noted between experimental conditions.

Paulo Marchetti |Alongamento passivo agudo não afeta a atividade muscular máxima dos ísquiotibiais|AS Bley, PS Nardi, PH Marchetti|2012/12|Motricidade|8|4|80-86|Revista Motricidade/Edições Desafio Singular|The acute stretching may influence the force production in different tasks and sports performances. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of acute passive stretch on the electrical activity of the biceps femoris (BF) and hamstring muscle (HS) strength. Fourteen young adults, sedentary took part of this study. The subjects were asked to produce the maximal isometric contractions before and after a passive stretching protocol. The stretching protocol consisted of three attempts at 60 seconds and resting 15 seconds between each attempt. The subjects were analyzed using the following techniques: maximal isometric force (MIF), integrated electromyography (IEMG) and median frequency (Fmed) of the EMG signal of the BF before and after stretching. We performed the MIF, IEMG and Fmed of the EMG signal under these conditions and compared using a paired Student t test. The MIF of the biceps femoris (14.1 ± 4.9 e 13.1 ± 4.5 Kgf, respectively, p = .12), IEMG (208.4 ± 89.9 e 189.3 ± 75 V.s, respectively, p = .059), and FMed (22.7 ± 4 e 23.4 ± 5.5 Hz, respectively, p = .52) showed no significant differences between conditions before and after stretching. The acute effects of passive stretching did not significantly influence the pattern of electrical activation of the BF and the maximal isometric force produced by the HS. 
Paulo Marchetti |Influence of unilateral fatigue of lower limbs on the bilateral vertical jump|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|2011/12|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|17|6|405-408|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|It is common to observe bilateral strength deficit during the vertical jump. This is characterized by lower strength produced during bilateral contractions, when compared to the sum of the unilateral contractions of similar muscles. There is not much scientific knowledge about the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral deficit performance during bipedal vertical jump. Ten sedentary young adults unilaterally fatigued each lower limb and performed vertical jumps (bipedal and unipedal). We measured the vertical ground reaction force and myoelectrical activity to each lower limb and conditions (pre-fatigue, fatigue of the dominant limb (FD) and non dominant limb (FND)) were measured. Differences between tasks and conditions only on the pre-fatigue (p=0.030) were observed. Differences were observed for the bipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p=0.005), and unipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p<0.001) and FND (p<0.001). We only observed change on the performance of bipedal vertical jump during the FD condition. We observed a trend to the asymmetry index decrease for the muscular action of the fatigued contralateral lower limb by electromyography. The results suggest that there is a common command where the nervous system considers the muscles simultaneously activated as a unit, except in conditions of unilateral lower limb fatigue. 
Paulo Marchetti |Influência da fadiga unilateral de membro inferior sobre o salto vertical bilateral|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|2011|Rev. bras. med. esporte|17|6|405-408||Em saltos verticais é comum a verificação do déficit de força bilateral. Essa é caracterizada pela menor força gerada em contrações bilaterais, quando comparada à soma das contrações unilaterais dos mesmos músculos. Pouco se conhece sobre o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre atividades bilaterais. O objetivo do estudo foi verificar o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre o rendimento e o déficit bilateral durante saltos verticais bipedais. Dez adultos jovens sedentários fatigaram unilateralmente cada membro inferior e realizaram saltos verticais (bipedal e unipedal). Foram medidas a força de reação do solo vertical e a atividade mioelétrica de cada membro em cada condição (pré-fadiga, fadiga do membro dominante (FD) e não dominante (FND)). Houve diferença entre tarefas e condições apenas na pré-fadiga (p= 0,030). Verificaram-se diferenças para o salto bipedal entre a condição de pré-fadiga e FD (p= 0,005), e no salto unipedal, entre a pré-fadiga e FD (p< 0,001) e FND (p< 0,001). Apenas durante a condição de FD houve alteração no desempenho dos saltos bipedais, tendo maior influência no desempenho dos saltos. Observou-se tendência de diminuição do índice de assimetria para a ação muscular do membro contralateral fatigado, observado através de eletromiografia. Através dos dados sugere-se que exista um comando comum onde o sistema nervoso considere os músculos ativados simultaneamente como uma unidade, exceto em condições de fadiga unilateral.

Santos, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2015|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|21|3|224-229||Introduction: Stretching exercises have been related to a performance deficit on strength-dependent activities. However, little is known about its effect on multiple sets of strength training. Objective: To determine the effect of an extensive stretching protocol on the performance of multiple sets and soreness in strength training. Methods: The sample was composed by 12 trained-men, experienced in strength training. The protocol consisted of three sessions. The first session was used as a familiarization and load determination to 10 maximum repetitions (T10RM). The second and third conditions were randomized between subjects, and the bench press exercise (BP) was evaluated without previous stretching protocol (SEMA), and with previous stretching protocol (COMA). The stretching protocol consisted of six sets of 45 sec of stretch with 15 sec of resting intervals to the pectoralis major muscle. The stretching intensity was kept between 70 and 90% of the subjective point of discomfort. The local soreness was evaluated before and after exercise by a brief stretching and palpation. The Analysis of Variance ANOVA (2x6) was used to compare the maximum number of repetitions. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the load of the first set of each condition (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). The Student t-test was used to compare the total load and soreness. Results: A decrease on maximum number of repetitions along the sets was observed in both conditions, without differences between them, for the load of the first set, total load and soreness. Conclusion: The number of repetitions in multiple sets was reduced in the same magnitude in the conditions with … 
Paulo Marchetti |Efeito da ordem dos exercícios no treinamento de força|Enrico Gori Soares, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2013|Revista CPAQV-Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|5|3|1-14||Diversos estudos demonstram que a ordem de execução dos exercícios influenciam a performance neuromuscular em uma sessão de treinamento, e conseqüentemente as suas respostas ao treinamento. O objetivo do presente estudo foi revisar a literatura científica quanto aos efeitos da ordem dos exercícios na performance neuromuscular durante o treinamento de força. Observa-se que o efeito da ordem dos exercícios durante uma sessão de treinamento pode influenciar a performance neuromuscular quando realizados no início da sessão de treinamento quando comparada à sua realização ao final da sessão de treino. A percepção subjetiva de esforço parece não ser afetada pela ordem de execução dos exercícios e o sistema nervoso central parece alterar o padrão de recrutamento dos músculos em exercícios multiarticulares quando precedidos por um exercício monoarticular, aparentemente aumentando a solicitação dos músculos sinérgicos. Intervalos de recuperação maiores parecem afetar menos a performance neuromuscular quando comparados à intervalos menores, independente da sequência dos exercícios. 
Paulo Marchetti |Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício agachamento|Paulo H Marchetti|2013|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida–ISSN|5|2|2013||Actually the strength training has been widely used in different contexts and for different purposes: athletic, recreational, esthetic and therapeutic. Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions imposed on the squat exercise may result in changes in the action of muscles, kinematics and kinetic, and consequently increasing or decreasing their performance and/or efficiency.

Eleven male Parkour practitioners and 12 male physical educators participated in this study and performed: pull-up test, handgrip strength dynamometer test (HSDT), p lyo metric push-up test, maximal horizontal ju mp, and maximal bipodal and unipodal countermovement jumps (CMJ). We calculated limb asymmetry for HSDT and CMJs and the bilateral deficit for CMJs. Significant differences were found between groups for the pull-up test (P= 0.002), plyometric push-up test (P= 0.039), bipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), dominant unipodal CMJ (P= 0.008), nondominant unipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), maximal horizontal jump (P< 0.001), and bilateral deficit (P< 0.004). The Parkour group presented higher performance than the active group, except for HSDT. 
Paulo Marchetti |Investigações sobre o controle motor e postural nas assimetrias em membros inferiores|Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2009||||||Durante diferentes atividades cotidianas ou esportivas o ser humano é submetido a desafios unilaterais que podem estar relacionados à performance de uma tarefa específica ou a própria manutenção de sua postura. Portanto, é natural o desenvolvimento motor de um membro em relação ao outro para tarefas específicas, desde que estas sejam repetidas de forma não simétrica. Desta forma, pode-se supor que sujeitos que possuam maiores estresses físicos unilaterais apresentem maior probabilidade em desenvolver assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas. O presente trabalho apresenta três diferentes experimentos visando investigar as assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas relacionadas ao controle de movimento para tarefas dinâmicas e estáticas em diferentes condições e grupos. O primeiro experimento visou investigar as diferenças, entre os membros inferiores, no controle de movimento entre sedentários e atletas, utilizando para isto a postura ereta quieta e o salto com contra-movimento nas condições bipedais e unipedais. O segundo experimento visou investigar o efeito da fadiga neuromuscular unilateral e bilateral no controle de movimento, entre membros, durante o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta bipedal. O terceiro experimento objetivou investigar o efeito prolongado da temporada esportiva no controle de movimento, entre membros, de atletas, utilizando o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta nas condições unipedal e bipedal. Inicialmente, o presente trabalho concluiu que não parece existir relação entre as diferenças antropométricas e funcionais. Indivíduos sedentários e atletas …

PEREIRA, J.O. SILVA, A.K. YAMADA, P.H. MARCHETTI, R. VERLENGIA|2015|Gazzeta Medica Italiana|174|1|1-7||Aim. The purpose of this study was to determine how the execution velocity of eccentric exercises affects postexercise muscle damage in resistance-trained males using free-weight exercises. Methods. Twenty young males were divided by maximum eccentric strength into two groups: slow eccentric velocity (SEV, N.= 10) and fast eccentric velocity (FEV, N.= 10). Both groups performed four sets of eight repetitions with 70% of their one repetition maximum eccentric in a bench press exercise with a 2-minute rest interval between sets. Each group lifted an equal total volume load. The eccentric velocity was controlled to 3 seconds for the SEV group and 0.5 seconds for the FEV group. The 1RM test, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and creatine kinase (CK) activity were evaluated before and up to 96 hours postexercise. Results. A significant reduction (compared with baseline values) in 1RM test was observed up to 48 hours postexercise for the FEV group, while a significant reduction for the SEV group was only observed at 24 hours. The FEV group had a significant increase in DOMS up to 72 hours postexercise while the SEV group experienced an increase lasting up to 48 hours. The serum CK activity increased significantly only at 72 hours postexercise for both groups. There were no significant differences for any of the indirect analyses of muscle damage when the values were compared between groups. Conclusion. In conclusion, a six-fold differ-

Paulo Marchetti |Comparison of the Postural Control Performance of Collegiate Basketball Players and Nonathletes|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Erin Heather Hartigan, Marcos Duarte|2012|Athletic Training & Sports Health Care|4|6|251-256||Athletes who play basketball are at risk for ankle injuries. Whether athletes demonstrate different postural stability and limb asymmetry during a quiet standing task compared with nonathletes is unknown. Fifteen collegiate basketball players and 15 nonathletes performed 3 trials of bipedal quiet standing for 30 s with 60 s of rest. Postural stability measures were obtained for each limb: integration of the resultant of the center of pressure (COP) speed (anteroposterior [AP] and mediolateral [ML] directions); COP area; and frequency (AP and ML). An asymmetry index between lower limbs was calculated for COP speed (AP and ML), COP area, and weight distribution. Basketball players demonstrated less COP speed (ML)(P=. 039), decreased levels of asymmetry for COP speed (P=. 033), and reduced COP area (P=. 005) and COP speed in the ML direction, compared with nonathletes. Whether this reduction influences …

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible to early muscle fatigue. The objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of LED on muscle function, exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory responses during isometric and dynamic exercise in patients with COPD. This study will assess 30 patients with moderate to severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume-one second,FEV1 ≤70% predicted). Isometric and dynamic protocols will be conducted in two visits each, for a total of four visits a week apart. First, venous blood will be taken from the patients. The isometric protocol will start with the determination of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MIVC) to determine the workload (60% of MIVC) for the isometric endurance test (IET). Patients will be randomized to receive either the placebo or LED application (each point will be irradiated for 30 s and the energy received at each point will be 41.7 J). Immediately after finishing this procedure, the patients will carry out the IET until the limit of tolerance or until a 20% fall of strength is observed. After the test, another blood draw will be taken. In another visit (one week later), the same order of procedures will be performed, except with the opposite (LED or placebo). For the dynamic endurance test (DET), the same procedures described above will be followed, except with 75% of the maximal workload obtained from the incremental cycle ergometer test used instead of the IET. The electromyography will be recorded during the isometric and dynamic protocols … 
Paulo Marchetti |Parkour: história e conceitos da modalidade|Ana Luiza Martins Stramandinoli, Jarbas Gomes Remonte, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2012/8/17|Revista Mackenzie de Educação física e esporte|11|2|||O Parkour é uma atividade física baseada em uma proposta do Método Natural (MN) e do Parcours Du Combattant (PDC). O objetivo do presente trabalho foi revisar aspectos históricos, além dos conceitos fundamentais da modalidade Parkour. George Hébert foi o criador do MN, antagônico à ginástica e à especialização esportiva. Publicou as bases do MN, utilizando gestos naturais e o desenvolvimento físico completo. O PDC, idealizado por Raymond Belle, foi adaptado do MN e do treinamento militar básico. David Belle continuou o legado de seu pai, baseado no conceito de que o treinamento deve ser aplicado à vida real e às situações extremas. Concluímos que os aspectos conceituais e históricos do Parkour são fundamentais para definir sua identidade dentro do contexto da área da Educação Física. 
Paulo Marchetti |The central and peripheric fatigue: a brief review of the local and non-local effects on neuromuscular system|Willy Andrade Gomes, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2016|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|8|1|2||The fatigue can be defined as a gradual reduction of muscular efficiency in producing strength and power for extended periods, and it may occur in a peripheral and/or central system. Several mechanisms and systems can be affected by fatigue, so it is considered multifactorial. Fatigue can affect different locations through a variety of mechanisms, leading to reduced the performance in the specific activity, or subsequent task. Interestingly, the process of fatigue may involve both the fatigued limb (local fatigue) or not fatigued limb (non-local fatigue). Thus, the aim of this study was to perform a brief review of the effects of neuromuscular fatigue protocols on physical performance. Several mechanisms are related to neuromuscular fatigue, however, factors such as the type of muscle fiber, the gender, the experimental protocol, or the fitness level may influence the effects of local and nonlocal fatigue.

Schoenfeld|2015|International Journal of Sports Science|5|1|39-43||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of static-stretching (SS) session with (intermittent) and without (continuous) rest intervals between sets on the bounce drop jump performance, with the same volume and intensity. The experimental protocol consisted of (1) a brief warm-up using sub-maximal jumps;(2) a pre-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for each lower limb);(3) ankle plantar flexors SS protocol (intermittent or continuous) was used only for a single-lower limb;(4) immediate post-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for the stretched lower limb). Then, subjects rest for 30 minutes and the topics 3-4 were repeated with the other lower limb and stretching protocol. The intensity used for both stretching protocols was between 70-90% of the point of discomfort. There were significant decrease in jumping height performance for both stretching protocols: continuous (P= 0.001) and intermittent (P= 0.006). There were significant increase in contact time only for the continuous protocol (P= 0.025). Our findings indicated that both stretching protocols (intermittent or continuous) were effective to increase the passive ankle ROM, and to decrease the single-leg jump height, however only the continuous SS protocol showed increases in the contact time.

Paulo Marchetti |Effects of a full season on stabilometric Parameters of team handball elite athletes.|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Maria Isabel Veras Orselli, Lúcio M. S. Martins, Marcos Duarte|2014|Motriz|20|1|71-77||It is unclear whether athletes change their postural control over the course of a full sport season, or become more asymmetrical with respect to their neuromuscular performance over the same period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a full sport season on the postural control of team handball elite athletes. Ten healthy, elite male team handball players performed bipodal standing (BP) and right and left unipodal standing (UP) during 30s. We used the RMS and speed of the center of pressure to describe postural sway. For the BP task, the sway was lower at the end of the season (p<0.005). For the UP tasks, the sway was lower at the end of the season only for the non-dominant limb (p<0.001). Differences between limbs were observed only at the end of the season (p<0.03). In conclusion, a full team handball season did not lead to deterioration of the athletes' postural control, but by the end of the season, the athletes were more asymmetrical.

High resistance-training frequency enhances muscle thickness in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res XX (X): 000–000, 2018—The purpose of this study was to compare the effect a split training routine with muscle groups trained once per week (SPLIT) vs. whole-body split training routine with muscle groups trained 5 days per week (TOTAL) on neuromuscular adaptations in well-trained men. Eighteen healthy men (height= 177.8 6 6.6 cm; total body mass= 84.4 6 8.1 kg; age= 26.4 6 4.6 years) were recruited to participate in this study. The experimental groups were matched according to baseline strength and then randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 experimental groups: SPLIT (n= 9) or TOTAL (n= 9). Prestudy and poststudy testing included 1RM for bench press, parallel back-squat and machine close-grip seated row, as well as an ultrasound analysis of the muscle thickness (MT) of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and vastus lateralis. After 8 weeks of training, no significant difference between groups was noted for all 1RM tests (p. 0.05 AU2). TOTAL induced a significantly greater increase in MT of the forearm flexors and vastus lateralis (p, 0.05). In conclusion, muscle strength increment is similar regardless of the experimental conditions studied; however, TOTAL may confer a potentially superior hypertrophic effect.

Bras. Ciên. Saúde)|8|26|||Muitos são os exercícios utilizados para o desenvolvimento dos músculos que envolvem os membros superiores (particularmente o latíssimo do dorso, peitoral maior, redondo maior, deltóide parte espinal e bíceps braquial). Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos do exercício pulley que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino como o deslocamento da barra em relação ao tronco, os diferentes tipos de pegada (supinada e pronada) e as variações no comprimento da pegada na barra. O entendimento destas variações técnicas do exercício pulley podem influenciar a correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício pulley e suas variações. Poucos são os estudos que analisam as variações na técnica do exercício pulley, mas puderam ser observadas que diferentes alterações mecânicas realizadas podem acarretar em mudanças na ação dos músculos envolvidos neste exercício, aumentando ou diminuindo a performance e/ou sua eficiência.

Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21,9 ± 3,4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4,6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p < 0,005) no período preparatório (13,71 ± 1,30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14,68 ± 1,51) e competitivo II (14,63 ± 1,22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p < 0,005) no período competitivo II (3,59 ± 0,30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3,80 ± 0,36) e competitivo I (3,86 ± 0,26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p < 0,001) no período competitivo II (1,18 ± 0,43) em comparação com o preparatório (2,50 ± 2,01) e competitivo I (2,10 ± 1,61).

Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular.

Os objetivos do presente estudo foram investigar o déficit bilateral e a simetria entre os membros inferiores de sujeitos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA e comparar com sujeitos não lesionados. Vinte adultos jovens foram divididos em dois grupos (LCA e controle). A tarefa consistiu na execução do exercício Leg Press (unilateral direita e esquerda e bilateral). O número de repetições máximas (RM) foi quantificado e então o déficit bilateral e o índice de assimetria foram calculados. Os resultados mostraram assimetria no número de RM realizada entre membros no grupo LCA (p= 0,005) e apenas o grupo controle apresentou déficit bilateral (p= 0,004). Conclui-se que indivíduos que realizaram a reconstrução do LCA apresentaram assimetrias entre membros, sem a presença de déficit bilateral.

Doce mujeres jóvenes sanas y entrenadas realizaron una sesión de Pilates con una Silla Wunda. En dos momentos distintos (pre y post-intervención), se registraron las imágenes de resonancia magnética (RM) ponderadas por el tiempo de relajación transversal (T2) y las evaluaciones isocinéticas de las extremidades inferiores. Hubo aumentos significativos en la intensidad de la señal T2 post-intervención en el glúteo mayor y en toda la porción muscular (proximal, medial y distal) del vasto lateral y del recto femoral. Hubo disminuciones significativas en: el rendimiento de pre a post-intervención en el pico de torque, el trabajo total y la potencia media del momento de extensión. Sin embargo, en el momento de la flexión, no hubo diferencias significativas en el rendimiento entre la pre-y la post-intervención. Los resultados confirman que el método Pilates, cuando se aplica con el control de variables tales como series de tiempo, repeticiones e intervalos de descanso, promueve una modificación de la fuerza muscular y el volumen de los grupos musculares afectados. La capacidad de manipular variables de entrenamiento cuando se aplica al aparato de Pilates promueve cambios agudos similares como se informó en estudios de entrenamiento de fuerza.

Paulo Marchetti |EFEITOS AGUDOS E ADAPTAÇÕES NEUROMUSCULARES DECORRENTE DA MANIPULAÇÃO DE VOLUME E DENSIDADE NO TREINAMENTO DE FORÇA|Enrico Gori Soares, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2017|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|9|2|2||A manipulação do volume e da densidade no treinamento de força é realizada através do gerenciamento do número de séries realizadas em cada grupamento muscular e como essas séries são alocadas na sessão e na semana de treinamento. A manipulação dessas variáveis altera as respostas agudas e as adaptações crônicas no sistema neuromuscular. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi revisar os efeitos agudos e adaptações neuromusculares decorrentes da manipulação diária e semanal do volume e densidade no treinamento de força. A combinação da ordem dos exercícios, sistemas de treinamentos e séries realizadas tem demonstrado ser uma estratégia eficiente para aumentar o desempenho e reduzir o tempo da sessão de treinamento. Estudos prévios sugerem que o aumento da sobrecarga pode ser realizado através da manipulação das séries na sessão do treinamento e do número de sessões ao longo da semana. Quanto à frequência de treinamento, a literatura parece ser clara ao sugerir ganhos superiores de força e hipertrofia muscular quando duas a três sessões por grupamento muscular são realizadas na semana. Entretanto, frequências de até 6 sessões na semana para o mesmo grupo muscular podem favorecer o anabolismo muscular. A presente revisão conclui que em uma única sessão de treinamento até 30 séries por grupo muscular podem ser necessárias dependendo do objetivo e da população treinada. O desempenho agudo da sessão (volume absoluto, força e potência) pode ser melhorado por meio de diferentes ordens de exercícios ou sistemas de treinamento quando essas estratégias …

Paulo Marchetti |Discinese Escapular: revisão sobre implicações clínicas, aspectos biomecânicos, avaliação e reabilitação|Andre Serra Bley, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucarelli, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2016|assessment|8|2|||A discinese escapular é caracterizada pelo movimento desequilibrado da escápula durante os movimentos do membro superior, sendo então apontada como um dos fatores predisponentes às lesões no complexo articular do ombro. A presença ou ausência da discinese escapular deve ser determinada durante um exame clínico constituído por inspeção estática e dinâmica da posição escapular e baseada nesta avaliação, a reabilitação inclui exercícios de alongamento e fortalecimento da musculatura escapular. O objetivo deste estudo foi realizar uma revisão sobre as principais características abordadas na literatura sobre a discinese escapular. Foram selecionados os artigos de maior relevância para o objetivo do estudo, entre os anos de 1999 e 2015. A avaliação estática e dinâmica da escápula, apesar de ser baseada num exame qualitativo, é um meio eficiente de identificar as principais alterações biomecânicas da escápula e dessa forma, capaz de auxiliar no estabelecimento dos objetivos de tratamento para esta condição.

Paulo Marchetti |Acute effects on performance of the vertical jump after back squat with knee wraps|Willy Andrade Gomes, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Enrico Gori Soares, Erica Paes Serpa, Daniel Alves Corrêa, Vilela Junior, Guanis de Barros, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2015/8|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|21|4|257-260|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|INTRODUCTION: Knee wraps can affect the muscular performance during high-intensity exercises by reducing muscle activation, which may influence the effect of post-activation potentiation, which depends on high intensity for the following power exercise. Objective: To investigate the acute effects on the performance with counter-movement jump (CMJ) after high-intensity squat with and without the use of knee wraps in resistance trained subjects. METHODS: The study included 14 men (aged 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, weight: 81±11kg, 1RM: 107±30kgf) resistance trained (>3 years). Three SCM were performed before and after three back squats at 90% of 1RM with and without the knee wraps. During the CMJ muscle activation (IEMG) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), jump time (JT), and impulse (IMP) through the force of vertical ground reaction (FRSV) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results show statistically significant differences for JT between post-back-squat conditions (with and without wrap) (P=0.044, TE=1.02), whereas the highest values were observed without knee wrap. For IEMG of VL significant difference between pre and post-conditions after back squat (with knee wrap) (P=0.029, TE=1.68) was observed, and the highest values were observed for the IEMG with knee wrap. No significant differences between conditions were observed for IEMG of GM and IMP. CONCLUSION: After using the knee wraps during the squat exercise, there was a reduction in the involvement of the vastus lateralis during the jump with counter-movement, affecting the contact time, but not the production of impulse and consequent …

MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta de 12 homens experientes com treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira serviu como familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos, sendo uma realizada com a avaliação do supino reto (SR) sem alongamento prévio (SEMA), e a outra com alongamento prévio (COMA). O protocolo de alongamento consistiu de seis séries de 45 seg de alongamento por 15 seg de intervalo visando o músculo peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após o exercício, a dor local foi avaliada por meio de breve alongamento e palpação. A Análise de Variância ANOVA (2x6) com medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar a carga da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). O teste-t de Student foi utilizado para comparar a carga total com a dor. RESULTADOS: Observou-se decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições, sem diferenças entre as mesmas, para a carga da primeira série, a carga total e a dor. CONCLUSÃO: O número de repetições em séries múltiplas é diminuído na mesma magnitude com e sem a realização do alongamento prévio, além de não alterar a carga total e a dor percebida.

Paulo Marchetti |Investigações sobre o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome|Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2005||||||O músculo reto do abdome é um importante músculo da parede abdominal, responsável pela estabilização e função da coluna, tanto em atividades atléticas quanto em atividades cotidianas. Entretanto, pouco se conhece sobre o controle neuromotor de tal estrutura em atividades voluntárias, como os exercícios abdominais, e como as diferentes tarefas agem na ativação segmentada das porções musculares do músculo reto do abdome. Em geral, a presente dissertação teve como objetivo investigar o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome em diferentes tarefas voluntárias através de quatro experimentos. O primeiro experimento teve como objetivo descrever as características morfológicas do músculo reto do abdome, em particular sua área de secção transversa, ao longo do comprimento longitudinal do músculo, utilizando as imagens do projeto homem visível (NLM). O segundo experimento objetivou o mapeamento dos pontos motores para cada porção muscular. O terceiro experimento investigou o controle neuromotor das diversas porções musculares em tarefas isométricas de baixa intensidade. E por fim, o quarto experimento investigou o comportamento das porções musculares em diferentes tarefas isométricas em condição de fadiga neuromuscular. Baseado nos experimentos apresentados neste estudo pode-se concluir que o músculo reto do abdome é uma estrutura extremamente complexa em sua arquitetura, sendo caracterizada por diversas porções musculares que se interconectam através de aponeuroses tendíneas, onde, possivelmente nenhuma fibra muscular atravesse seus ventres. Devido a tal …

MARCHETTI|2018|PLoS ONE|13|12|1-11|https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208834|Resistance training (RT) is performed at distinct levels of intensity from the beginning to the end of exercise sets, increasing the sensation of effort as the exercise progress to more vigorous levels, commonly leading to changes on the facial expression of RT practitioners. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and the activation of facial muscles by surface electromyography(sEMG) at two different levels of effort during resistance exercise and to investigate the correlation between facial expression and exercise intensity and fatigue. Eleven healthy male participants [23±6years; 1.77±6 m; 78±10kg] performed a set of arm curl exercise at 50% and 85% 1RM until muscle fatigue. The Surface electromyography (sEMG activity was recorded simultaneously in areas of the epicranius muscle (EM) and zygomatic major muscle (ZM). Facial expression was recorded and blindly scored by five experienced examiners. Scores (0–5) were based on the level of activity of the ZM (lip corner puller—Action Unit 12-FACS) during exercise. Facial expression and sEMG data were obtained during the exercise at the first repetition and at muscle failure. The root mean square (RMS) of the sEMG amplitude of the EM was significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.75; and 85%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.54). The RMS values for the ZM were significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p<0.001,d = 2.67; 85%1RM:p<0.001,d = 0.50). The RMS values for the ZM were also increased in 85%1RM compared to values obtained from 50 …

P.H.|2018|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte.|24|4|295-299||Introduction: The elastic knee wrap (EKW) is a device used by powerlifters, weightlifters and subjects undergoing strength training with the aim of stabilizing the knee joint and increasing the development of strength (carryover effect). Objective: To compare the effects of elastic knee wrap use on muscular activity of the vastus lateralis (VL) and on knee extension force during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) on the knee extensor chair. Methods: The study included 18 healthy male strength trained (>1 year) subjects (age: 25.56 ± 4.84 years, total body mass: 81.83 ± 8.73 kg, height: 176 cm ± 5.17). Three five-second maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the knee extensors were performed with a 10-second interval between attempts, for each experimental condition: control (C), with elastic knee wrap (EKW), and with tensor (T). The performance of the knee extensors and VL muscle activity were evaluated. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the dependent variables (carryover, peak force, IEMG and Impulse). Results: For carryover, the use of EKW presented a higher value (74.21%) than the control condition (p <0.001, d = 0.96) and was 79.37% higher than the tensor (p <0.001, d = 0.97). Peak force was 12.2% higher in condition C compared to EKW (p = .018, d = 0.71). For impulse, the control condition presented an increase of 8% compared to EKW use (p = .015, d = 0.62). No significant differences were observed for IEMG. Conclusion: Elastic knee wrap use increased strength production capacity during knee extension. The removal of the mechanical effect originating from carryover during MVIC …

MARCHETTI|2018|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte.|24|4|291-294||Introduction: The elastic wrap is widely used by different types of athletes and recreational practitioners of strength training in order to improve weightlifting performance. Objective: The objective was to investigate the acute effects of elbow wrap on strength performance, absolute volume, and rating of perceived exertion/discomfort during the bench press (BP) exercise. Methods: The experimental protocol was divided into three laboratory sessions. At the first session, a bench press familiarization phase was performed with (EW) and without (WEW) elastic elbow wrap. During the second session, the 1RM test was carried out in the bench press exercise under both EW and WEW conditions. At the third session, the repetition maximum (RM) test at 70% of 1RM (EW and WEW) was performed until concentric failure. After each session, subjects were consulted about their rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and discomfort (PSD). A paired student t-test was used to compare the values of 1RM and RMs with and without elastic wraps. Descriptive analysis was used for RPE and PSD. Results: For the 1RM test, there was a significant increase for the EW condition when compared to WEW (p<0.05). In the RMs test and absolute volume calculation, there was a significant increase for the EW condition (p<0.05). RPE did not differ in any of the conditions tested (p>0.05). PSD presented a high degree of discomfort with elastic wraps in all conditions. Conclusion: Elastic elbow wraps increase the load lifted in the 1RM test, and the maximum number of repetitions during the BP exercise, and consequently, the absolute volume. The elastic elbow wrap does not alter …

The following two sessions were randomized for continuous-or grouped-sets. For continuous-sets, 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise (BC and TE) were performed sequentially, while for grouped-sets, each exercise was alternated every 4 sets until 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise were completed. Two minutes of rest was used between sets and exercises. Volume load and muscle thickness (biceps brachii, MTBB, and triceps brachii, MTTB) were measured pre-and post-exercise. Peak force and myoelectric activity (iEMG) were measured for each exercise (BC and TE) and each muscle (biceps brachii and triceps brachii) during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction test. Results demonstrated that volume load was significantly greater in grouped-sets for both exercises (P< 0.001). MTBB and MTTB increased after both sessions (P< 0.001), however, there was a greater effect with continuous-sets when compared to grouped-sets (P= 0.001). Peak force decreased for both exercises and sets (P< 0.05). iEMG decreased only after continuous-sets for both muscles (P< 0.001). In conclusion, continuous-and grouped-sets resulted in specific neuromuscular responses and similar muscle thickness for prime movers. Continuous-sets …

AOKI|2018|Asian Journal of Sports Medicine|9|4|1-5||Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of different rest interval durations between sets during full-body resistance exercise sessions on total load lifted and blood lactate concentrations in resistance-trained individuals. Methods: Ten healthy young men (age: 23±6.5 years; total body mass: 82.8±10.6 kg, height: 177.3±0.1 cm) randomly performed 3 resistance exercise sessions with different rest intervals between sets (30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds). The resistance exercise sessions consisted of 6 full-body exercises (bench press; seated low row; shoulder press; back squat; leg press 45 and seated calf raise) performed with 4 sets of 10 repetitions maximum (RM). Total load lifted (sets× repetitions× load (Kgf)) and lactate blood concentration were determined for each exercise session. One way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test were used for multiple comparisons. Results: The total load lifted was significantly (P< 0.001) lower for 30 seconds (26382.0±4100.3 kg) rest interval compared with 60 seconds (28864.5±4139.7 kg) and 120 seconds (30064.4±3966.4 kg). The blood lactate response was not different among the 3 rest interval conditions investigated, with mean peak values of 7.05±1.69, 7.26±2.77 and 6.90±3.79 mM for 30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, rest interval durations of 60 seconds and 120 seconds between sets favored a higher total load lifted in the exercise session when compared to the 30 seconds rest interval. The rest protocols implemented in the present study promoted a similar metabolic …

Keeping the drop height constant, the variation of the landing technique can modify the performance and the mechanical characteristics of the jump. Objective: To evaluate the effects of different landing techniques on the performance and the reaction force of the vertical component of the ground after drop jump. Methods: Twenty-five healthy and physically active men (age: 26±8 years, total body mass: 75±10 kg, height: 175±10 cm) performed four landing techniques after the drop jump: bounce drop jump (BDJ), drop jump with 90° of knee flexion (DJ90), drop jump with 135° of knee flexion (DJ135), and drop jump with 135° of knee flexion with hands resting on the ground (DJ135A). Three attempts were performed for each technique; the subjects performed the drop jump falling from a 40 cm high force platform. The measures of jump height, contact time and impact were determined by the force of reaction of the vertical component of the ground, measured by the force platform, at a frequency of acquisition of 2,000 Hz. The repeated measures by ANOVA were used to compare the different techniques. Results: The BDJ technique presented lower jump height, shorter contact time and greater impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). The DJ90 technique presented jump height similar to the DJ135 and DJ135A techniques and a short contact time (P<0.001) and a lower impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). Conclusion: The highest jumps were observed for DJ90, DJ135 and DJ135A. The lowest contact time was observed in the BDJ technique, followed by DJ90 …

Na terceira idade, é maior a pré-disposição para as doenças crônicas degenerativas, dentre elas a osteoporose, considerada um problema de saúde mundial. As mulheres são mais suscetíveis a esta doença pois, além de terem menor massa óssea que o homem, quando chegam na fase da menopausa, apresentam maior descalcificação óssea, aumentando o risco de fraturas. Neste sentido, o treinamento de força é um grande aliado na prevenção dessa patologia, proporcionando bem-estar físico e mental, aumento da massa muscular e proteção dos ossos quanto a possíveis lesões e, se associado com algum método farmacológico, auxilia diretamente no tratamento da osteoporose. A presente revisão faz uma abordagem sobre a importância do treinamento de força em mulheres menopausadas e a profilaxia no desenvolvimento da osteoporose, favorecendo uma melhor qualidade de vida. A prática do treinamento de força proporciona à mulher idosa e portadora da osteoporose, maior flexibilidade e mobilidade, permitindo maior independência nas atividades da vida diária.

MARCHETTI|2017|Motriz|23|3|1-5||Aim the aim was to investigate the influence of a maximal isometric muscle action of the elbow extensors on the contralateral dynamic task of the elbow flexors. Methods Seventeen recreationally trained men (23.3 ± 4.9 yrs, BMI: 24.8 ± 2.2 Kg/m²) underwent two randomized different testing sessions separated by one week. In the control session (CON) all subjects performed a maximum number of repetitions test (RMs) at 75%1RM using the right elbow flexors. The experimental session (EXP) was similar to the CON; however, all subjects were instructed to perform RMs at 75%1RM by using the right elbow flexors and maintaining the maximal voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors during the test. RMs, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and training volume (TV) were measured and compared between sessions. Results The EXP showed a significant 10.4% increase on the RMs (13.8 vs. 12.5, p < 0.001, d = 0.44) and 12.1% increase in TV (238.0 vs. 212.4 kg, p < 0.001, d = 0.43) than CON. No differences were observed for RPE between sessions. Conclusion The maximum voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors increased the RMs of the contralateral elbow flexors, reflecting a higher TV, and no differences in the RPE. Our results suggest that the investigated method may be a viable and practical alternative to increase the acute strength performance of elbow flexors when using submaximal loads. 
Paulo Marchetti |Effects of Squat Amplitude On Pelvic Tilt and Tibial Inclination|P.H. MARCHETTI, G.Z. FIORAVANTE, J.J. DA SILVA, W.A. GOMES, E.G. SOARES, S.L. PECORARO, F.S. FREITAS, R.A. MAGALHÃES, M.M.S. MIYATAKE, L.E. BROWN|2017|MOJ Sports Medicine|1|1|1-3||Strength training is commonly performed at two different knee flexion amplitudes: partial (to 90 degrees) or total (to 140 degrees). During these amplitudes, both the pelvis and the tibia are moved to ensure control of the center of gravity and displacement of the external overload. Forward or backward movement of the pelvic tilt may indirectly influence the internal load on the spine. Objective: To measure the effect of squat amplitude on pelvictilt and tibia inclination. Eighteen male subjects (age: 26±6 years, height: 178±7 cm, total body mass: 81.3±11 kg, resistance training experience: 5±4 years) were evaluated. Pelvic tilt and tibial inclination were measured by a digital inclinometer (Max Measure, USA, accuracy:±0.02, resolution: 0.05) during isometric squatting at partial and full amplitudes. The digital inclinometer was fixed on the sacrum and on the tibia, with aneutral spine position. A paired student t-test and a significance of 5% were used. There were significant differences in pelvic tilt between partial and full amplitudes (+ 32.4±10.9 and-21.7±12.3, respectively, P< 0.001). Maximum tibial inclination values were not significantly different between partial and total amplitudes (19.1±6.6 and 20.1±7.4, respectively, P= 0.225). It was concluded that the partial squat position produces anterior pelvic tilt while the full squat produces backward pelvic tilt. Inclination of the tibia is similar in both amplitudes of the squat.

No entanto, os reais mecanismos da possível ação do KT no desempenho ainda não estão totalmente claros. Portanto, o presente estudo objetivou realizar uma breve revisão dos trabalhos científicos sobre os efeitos da técnica do kinesio taping no desempenho de força e na atividade mioelétrica. Foram selecionados, dentre os artigos nacionais e internacionais, aqueles publicados entre os anos de 2004 e 2015. O emprego do KT parece afetar o desempenho de força ou atividade muscular na maioria dos estudos, entretanto, tais resultados observados devem ser considerados de forma cuidadosa, principalmente quanto aos quesitos referentes à técnica de colocação, posição e grau de tração. Outro fator que merece destaque é a diferença metodológica encontrada entre os estudos como a utilização de grupo controle e placebo, o poder dos estudos (baseado principalmente em um número pequeno de sujeitos avaliados), além da análise do efeito do tamanho; e desta forma, resultando em complicações na interpretação e comparação dos resultados.

However this practice can be negative to strength improvement and muscular power. Consequently, jump performance can be reduced after stretching exercises, depending on its duration and intensity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effects of different long-term stretching times on single-leg drop jump performance. METHODS: The sample was composed of 16 healthy jump experienced young adult athletes. The experimental protocol consisted of performing three maximum unipodal drop jumps from a 15 cm high platform, and landing on a contact mat (Hidrofit(r)), before and after two stretching times of the triceps surae muscles (i.e. a series of 3 minutes on one side and 6 minutes on the other, with the sides being randomly chosen), using an intensity of 70-90% of their subjective perception of discomfort. An ANOVA (2x2) analysis was used to verify differences for the jump height, contact time and flexibility, using a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between pre and post-stretching times of 3 and 6 minutes (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Contact time was higher only for the stretching time of 6 minutes (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: We conclude that stretching exercises of the triceps surae muscle, for 3 or 6 minutes, resulted in a decreased performance in the single-leg drop jump, a decrease in the vertical jump height (for 3 and 6 minutes) and contact time (for 6 minutes only), reinforcing the need for more debates in this area regarding stretching before power activities. 
Paulo Marchetti |Propulsion Phase of the Single Leg Triple Hop Test in Women with|AS Bley, JCF Correa, ACD Reis, NDDA Rabelo, PH Marchetti|2014||||||Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF …

Objective: To compare muscle function between quadriceps femoris (QF) and middle deltoid (MD) after a fatigue protocol and also the recovery time fatigue. Methods: Twenty-one patients (VEF1: 46±10% predicted) performed for both muscles: maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) pre and post 10, 30, 60min and 24h after completing an isometric endurance test (IET, 60%MVIC). All measurements were made with surface electromyograpy (sEMG) recording. For the temporal analysis the amplitude of the sEMG signals was expressed as root mean square (RMS, 1-s moving window), normalized by MVIC and then, the RMS EMG was integrated (iEMG). For the time-frequency analysis, EMG data were analyzed with a FFT applied to 1-s epochs and the … 
Paulo Marchetti |Activación Selectiva del Músculo Recto Abdominal Durante las Tareas Fatigantes y de Baja Intensidad|Paulo H Marchetti, André F Kohn, Marcos Duarte|2011/7/24|PubliCE Standard|||||Para comprender la potencial activación selectiva del músculo recto abdominal, se han llevado a cabo dos experimentos. En el primero, los participantes realizaron dos ejercicios isométricos controlados: elevación del tronco (elevación del tronco en posición supina) y elevación de piernas (elevación de las piernas flexionadas en posición supina) a baja intensidad (en la que solo se reclutan unas pocas unidades motoras). En el segundo experimento, los participantes realizaron los mismos ejercicios, pero se les pidió que mantuvieran un cierto nivel de fuerza para inducir a la fatiga. Se registró la actividad electromiográfica (EMG) de las porciones inferior y superior del músculo recto abdominal durante los ejercicios y se utilizaron análisis espacio-temporales y de frecuencia para describir los patrones de activación muscular.

METHODS: Ten healthy adult (mean age: 26±8years) performed isometric curl-up (supine trunk raise with feet free) and leg-raise (supine bent-leg raise) exercises. In order to understand the potential selective activation of the RA, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: curl up and leg raise at low-intensity. In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the EMG activities of the lower and upper portions of the RA during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. RESULTS: At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG … 
Paulo Marchetti |Atividade mioelétrica máxima dos músculos vasto medial oblíquo e vasto lateral em cadeia cinética aberta e fechada.|André Serra Bley, Diego Barbosa Fonseca, Marjori do Prado de los Santos, Adriano Rodrigues|2011|Terapia Manual|9|42|54-58||Introdução: O alinhamento patelar, por parte dos estabilizadores dinâmicos, está diretamente relacionado ao equilíbrio na atividade muscular do Vasto Medial Oblíquo (VMO) e Vasto Lateral (VL). Alterações anatômicas e biomecânicas do membro inferior são comumente relacionadas com a etiologia da Síndrome da Dor Femoropatelar (SDFP). Estudos constataram que o controle neural não apropriado do quadríceps está relacionado a esta condição, principalmente quando a magnitude e o início da atividade mioéletrica do VMO leva desvantagem em relação ao VL. Objetivo: Avaliar a ativação eletromiográfica do VMO e VL, em contração isométrica voluntária máxima, em ângulos articulares específicos de 80 em cadeia cinética aberta (CCA) e de 30 em cadeia cinética fechada (CCF). Método: Participaram 12 voluntários (24±4 anos), sendo 9 homens. Foi realizado um estudo transversal aprovado pelo comitê de ética da Instituição. Incluídos apenas voluntários hígidos, sedentários, sem histórico de lesão ou cirurgia nos membros inferiores. Foram submetidos a aquisições eletromiográficas do VMO e VL, durante contração isométrica voluntária máxima do quadríceps em CCA a 80 e em CCF a 30. O sinal elétrico foi analisado através da atividade eletromiográfica integrada (IEMG) e então foram comparadas as tarefas (CCA e CCF) e músculos (VMO e VL) através de uma ANOVA (2x2). Resultados: Durante a CIVM, a IEMG dos músculos VMO e VL apresentaram diferenças significativas quando comparados entre tarefas (CCA e CCF)(p= 0, 02 e p= 0, 08, respectivamente), entretanto, não foram verificadas diferenças entre músculos para … 
Paulo Marchetti |VALIDAÇÃO DO TAPETE DE CONTATO NA MENSURAÇÃO DA ALTURA DO SALTO EM JOGADORES DE BASQUETE DE ELITE VALIDITY OF CONTACT MAT FOR MEASURING JUMP HEIGHT IN ELITE BASKETBALL PLAYERS|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Fábio Luiz Ceschini|2010/3/22|Revista de Atenção à Saúde (antiga Rev. Bras. Ciên. Saúde)|7|21|||O tapete de contato tem sido utilizado em diversos estudos e possui grande aplicação prática no treinamento e no controle esportivo. Embora a plataforma de força seja considerada o “padrão ouro” na avaliação da certas variáveis dos saltos verticais, ela requer um ambiente de laboratório, assim como um alto custo para aquisição e manutenção. Consequentemente, os testes realizados no tapete de contato constituem uma boa alternativa para a avaliação de atletas na condição esportiva, quando, muitas vezes, o acesso a um laboratório se torna impossível e inacessível. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente estudo foi mensurar os critérios de validade do tapete de contato (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0-Brazil), comparando-se tais cálculos com os resultados do “padrão ouro” na plataforma de força. Quinze atletas de basquetebol de elite, categoria sub-21, foram submetidos a três tentativas do SCM no tapete de salto (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0) e na plataforma de força (OR6-1000, AMTI). A altura do salto vertical foi calculada utilizando-se ambos os equipamentos. Os valores de média (±1DP) para a altura do SCM, medidos pela plataforma de força, foram 32.3±5.1 cm e, para o tapete de contato, foram 32.44. 5cm. O teste t de Student pareado não apresentou diferenças significantes entre ambas as formas de mensuração (p= 0.90). O gráfico de Bland-Altman foi construído para fornecer uma interpretação visual aos dados. Portanto, o presente estudo sugere que os SCMs avaliados no tapete de contato apresentam confiáveis e consistentes medidas para a definição da altura de salto comparadas às obtidas por meio de plataformas de força, e que …

Paulo Marchetti |The effect of dominant first dorsal interosseous fatigue on the force production of|Yimeng Li, Kevin E Power, Paulo H Marchetti, David G Behm|||||||Crossover and non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) has generally focused on large muscle groups. It is unclear whether fatigue of a small muscle can result in NLMF of a larger muscle. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of small muscle (first dorsal interosseous; FDI) fatigue on the force and activation of contralateral homologous and larger heterologous muscles (biceps brachii, BB). Fifteen right-handed, male subjects performed three pre-test index finger abduction or elbow flexion maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) on the non-dominant side. Subsequently, they performed two 100s index finger abduction MVICs on the dominant side (experimental [fatigue] group) or rested for 5 minutes (control group). Afterwards, a single MVIC and a 12 repetition MVIC fatiguing protocol were completed with index finger abduction or elbow flexion on the non-dominant side. Force and electromyography (EMG) were measured from both sides. The force and EMG (median frequency: MDF) of nonexercised index finger abductors (IFA)/FDI and elbow flexors (EF)/BB significantly decreased after the fatiguing protocol. Compared with the control condition, the non-exercised IFA (12.5% and 5.7%) had significantly greater force and MDF fatigue indexes than the EF (5.2% and 1.7%).

Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions …

Entretanto, pouco é sabido sobre seu efeito ao longo de séries consecutivas no treinamento de força. Objetivo: Determinar o efeito do alongamento extensivo no desempenho de séries múltiplas no treinamento de força. Métodos: A amostra foi composta de 12 adultos jovens, experientes com o treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira delas serviu de familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos. A primeira delas avaliou a realização do supino reto sem alongamento prévio (SEMA). A segunda delas avaliou a realização do supino reto com alongamento prévio (COMA). O alongamento consistiu de 6 séries de 45” de alongamento com 15” de intervalo para o peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após ambas as condições foi avaliada a dor local por meio de um alongamento breve e palpação. Uma ANOVA (2x6) de medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar o load da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). Teste t de student foi utilizado para comparar o load total e a dor. Foi adotada uma significância de 5%. Resultados: Foi observado decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições. Entretanto, não foram observadas diferenças entre as condições … 
Paulo Marchetti |CONTACT: willy_edfisica@ yahoo. com. br|Willy A Gomes, Lee E Brown, Enrico G Soares, Josinaldo J Silva, Érica P Serpa, Daniel A Correa, Guanis B Vilela Junior, Charles R Lopes, Paulo H Marchetti|||||||Fourteen trained-men with at least one year’s training experience volunteered to participate in the study (age: 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, body mass: 81±11kg, BS 1RM: 107±30kg). The experiment was performed in two sessions. During the first session, the maximal BS strength (1RM) was evaluated (without KW), followed by a familiarization with the use of KW. In the session two, all subjects performed 1 set of 3 repetitions (self-selected cadence) under 4 different conditions in a random order: with KW and without KW (NW) at 60% and 90% 1RM. A rest period (10 minutes) was used between conditions. The descent phase was parallel to the ground (~ 90º of knee joint flexion). The spiral wrapping technique was used. For the muscle activation evaluation, the superficial electromyography (sEMG) technique was used on vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), only in a dominant lower limb. The IEMG was calculated from the sEMG data (normalized by maximum voluntary isometric contraction, MVIC) during each trial. A repeatedmeasured ANOVA was used for all dependent variables ((wraps x intensity). Post hoc comparisons were performed with the Bonferroni’s test. An alpha of 0.05 was used.

Normalmente, indivíduos treinados realizam entre 20 e 25 series para cada grupo muscular em uma única sessão. Adicionalmente a prática do treinamento de força, a fim aumentar a amplitude de movimento, a realização de alongamento passivo é frequente entre os praticantes. Entretanto, a literatura científica demonstra que a realização de alongamento passivo extensivo tem sido relacionada a um déficit no desempenho de atividades forca-dependentes (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011). os possíveis mecanismos responsáveis pela redução da força após a realização do alongamento são:(i) a inibição dos estímulos excitatórios do motoneurônios alfa, via estimulação das terminações nervosas III, IV e órgão tendinoso de golgi,(ii) aumento do atraso eletromecânico devido a maior complacência da unidade musculo-tendínea,(iii) alteração na relação comprimento--tensão da unidade musculo-tendínea, e (iv) isquemia local devido ao menor fluxo sanguíneo e acumulo de metabolitos (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011; Marchetti, oliveira Silva et al., 2014).

Paulo Marchetti |Acute effect of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching protocol on dynamic postural balance|Amine Ghram, Mohamed Damak, Fatma Rhibi, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|||||||This study aimed to investigate the effect of the contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (CR PNF) stretching protocol on dynamic balance. Twenty healthy young male performed two sessions in a randomized order; a session with CR PNF stretching protocol, and a session without stretching protocol. Bipedal dynamic balance was measured in anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions before and after the completion the two experimental sessions with eyes opened and closed. Results showed that there is no significant difference between two sessions in AP direction. However, in ML direction, the CR PNF stretching protocol enhanced significantly (p< 0.05) dynamic balance when compared with no stretching protocol. This study suggested that CR PNF stretching might be effective to improve dynamic balance control.

J Strength Cond Res 30 (3): 725–732, 2016—Circadian rhythms (CRs) persist in many physiological systems related to performance. The effects of circadian patterns on dynamic muscular power are minimal and conflicting. Furthermore, no study to date has investigated the effect of CR on bench press throws (BPTs) despite its popularity as a modality to increase muscular power. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of circadian variations on muscular power output and hormonal changes in men. College aged men (n= 7, age: 23.6 6 1.3 years, height: 179.9 6 5.4 cm, and body mass: 81.5 6 19.7 kg.) were recruited for this repeated measures study. Testing occurred at 4 different times of day (04: 00, 10: 00, 16: 00, and 22: 00 hours). Testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) hand … 
Justin Nicoll |Muscular strength and power in 3-to 7-year-old children|Andrew C Fry, Carol C Irwin, Justin X Nicoll, David E Ferebee|2015/8|Pediatric exercise science|27|3|345-354||To determine absolute and relative (adjusted for body mass) strength, mean power, and mean velocity for upper and lower body resistance exercises, forty-seven young boys and girls participated in maximal strength testing. Healthy young boys and girls, ages 3- to 7-years old, were tested for one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength, and 70% of 1-RM to determine mean power and mean velocity on the chest press and leg press exercises. Adult weight machines were modified to accommodate the smaller size and lower strength levels of the children. A 2 × 4 (sex × age) ANOVA was used to determine age and sex differences in performance. No interaction or sex differences were observed for any variable at any age. 1-RM strength, mean power, and mean velocity significantly increased across ages (p ≤ .05). When adjusted for body mass, the changes were insignificant, with one exception. Relative mean power …

Noninvasive assessment of skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain expression in trained and untrained men. J Strength Cond Res 31 (9): 2355–2362, 2017—Numerous conditions and types of physical activity (eg, exercise, aging, and muscle-related diseases) can influence muscle fiber types and the proteins expressed. To date, muscle fibers can only be characterized by actually obtaining a tissue sample using the invasive muscle biopsy procedure. Mechanomyography (MMG) is the assessment of the vibration properties of contracting skeletal muscle and has been proposed as a possible noninvasive method for muscle fiber analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to examine the feasibility of using MMG and muscle performance measures to noninvasively assess muscle fiber characteristics. Fifteen men (5 …

The purpose of this investigation was to describe the long-term response of ERK1/2 following circuit weight training (CWT), recreationally weight training (WT), powerlifting (PL) and weightlifting (WL). Independent t-tests were used to determine differences in trained groups compared to sedentary controls. Total ERK1/2 content was lower in PL and WL compared to their controls (p ≤ 0.05). Specific trained groups displayed large (WL: pERK/total-ERK; d = 1.25) and moderate (CWT: total ERK1/2; d = 0.54) effect sizes for altered kinase expression compared to controls. The results indicate ERK1/2 expression is down-regulated after chronic RE in well-trained weightlifters and powerlifters. Lower expression of this …

Justin Nicoll |The skeletal muscle fiber: A mechanically sensitive cell|Luke A Olsen, Justin X Nicoll, Andrew C Fry|2019/2/6|European journal of applied physiology|119|2|333-349|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|The plasticity of skeletal muscle, whether an increase in size, change in metabolism, or alteration in structural properties, is in a continuous state of flux largely dependent upon physical activity. Much of the past research has expounded upon these ever-changing aspects of the muscle fiber following exercise. Specifically, endocrine and paracrine signaling have been heavily investigated lending to much of the past literature comprised of such endocrinological dynamics following muscle activity. Mechanotransduction, the ability of a cell to convert a mechanical stimulus into an intracellular biochemical response, has garnered much less attention. Recent work, however, has demonstrated the physical continuity of the muscle fiber, specifically demonstrating a continuous physical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM), cytoskeleton, and nuclear matrix as a means to rapidly regulate gene expression following a …

Justin Nicoll |Thyroid hormones, performance, and psychological changes on overtraining in female distance runners|Justin Nicoll|2014||||||Statement of the Problem: Overtraining (OT) is common in endurance sports. Perturbations in the hormonal milieu are common throughout OT literature. Thyroid hormones (TH) are altered by energy imbalances, and these imbalances are often present in female endurance athletes. Thyroid hormones also regulate metabolism, energy production, and therefore they may play a role in commonly cited symptoms of OT in these athletes. Alterations in TH status often occur slowly, and research investigating TH and their relationship in overtrained athletes is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships in TH and commonly cited symptoms of OT in collegiate track and field (T&F) endurance runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field middle (MD; n= 9; age: 20.21±1.49 yrs; height: 167.86±5.04 cm; body mass: 57.97±5.05 kg; VO 2MAX: 53.62±6.04 ml/kg/min) and long (LD; n= 7; age: 20.47±1.53 yrs; height: 162.48±6.11 cm; body mass: 56.15±5.99 kg; VO 2MAX: 61.94±3.29 ml/kg/min) distance runners participated in a 14 week descriptive study. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4), were collected at the beginning of the indoor T&F (PRE) and end of the outdoor T&F season (POST). Dietary intake and vertical jump power (VJP) were tested at PRE, MID, and POST season. A fatigue scale was administered weekly, and percent change (ΔRT) in race time (season best vs championship performance) was calculated. Wilcoxon-sign ranked tests were used to determine changes in hormonal, dietary, and performance measures over time. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was … 
Justin Nicoll |Skeletal muscle signaling responses to resistance exercise of the elbow extensors are not compromised by a preceding bout of aerobic exercise|Björn Hansson, Luke A Olsen, Justin X Nicoll, Ferdinand von Walden, Michael Melin, Anna Strömberg, Eric Rullman, Thomas Gustafsson, Andrew C Fry, Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalo, Tommy R Lundberg|2019/4/10|American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology||||American Physiological Society|The current study examined the effects of a preceding bout of aerobic exercise (AE) on subsequent molecular signaling to resistance exercise (RE) of the elbow extensors. Eleven men performed unilateral elbow-extensor AE (~45 min at 70% peak workload) followed by unilateral RE (4×7 maximal repetitions) for both arms. Thus, one arm performed AE+RE interspersed by 15 min recovery, whereas the other arm conducted RE alone. Muscle biopsies were taken from the triceps brachii of each arm immediately before (PRE), 15 min (POST1) and 3h (POST2) after RE. Molecular markers involved in translation initiation, protein breakdown, mechanosignaling and ribosome biogenesis, were analysed. Peak power during RE was reduced by 24% (±19%) when preceded by AE (P<0.05). Increases in PGC1a and MuRF1 expression were greater from PRE to POST2 in AE+RE compared to RE (18- vs. 3.5- and 4- vs. 2 …

Justin Nicoll |MAPK Signaling and Intracellular Hormone Receptor Phosphorylation at Rest and Following Resistance Training|Justin Nicoll|2018/5/31||||||Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, JNK, and p38 are a family of signal transduction proteins that respond to diverse forms of physiological stress including exercise. MAPK appear to mediate several adaptations to exercise skeletal muscle however most of their data are limited to cell culture, animal or endurance training study designs. Increasing evidence suggests they mediate translational efficiency and capacity. Further, recent data indicates they can regulate the steroid androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors via phosphorylation. However, there are no data investigating AR and GR phosphorylation in humans or their response to resistance exercise (RE). Thus, understanding how MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation respond during resistance exercise will give us better insight to their specific roles in muscle adaptation. This dissertation investigated the activation of MAPK and epinephrine receptor signaling to a caffeine containing pre-workout supplement during resistance exercise. Further, we also described MAPK expression and phosphorylated AR and GR in resting skeletal muscle between males and females. Finally, we conducted a training study to determine differences in MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation following a period of stressful resistance training. The results of this dissertation indicates 1) pre-workout supplementation improves performance but does not enhance MAPK or epinephrine receptor signaling early after RE, 2) males and females express different expression of phosphorylated AR, GR, and p38 at rest, 3) MAPK and phosphorylated AR and GR are activated after acute RE and are …

Justin Nicoll |The Effect of Three Different Maximal Concentric Velocity Squat Protocols on MAPK Phosphorylation and Endocrine Responses.|Rebecca A Kudrna, Andrew C Fry, Justin X Nicoll, Phillip M Gallagher, Michael R Prewitt|2017/12/27|Journal of strength and conditioning research|||||The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of three different back squat protocols on 2 intra-cellular signaling, endocrine responses, and power fatigue. Nine recreationally trained 3 males (X±SD; age: 21.4±0.6 yrs; height: 177.8±5.1 cm; weight: 78.7±9.7 kg), completed three 4 maximal concentric velocity squat protocols in a randomized order. Testing protocols consisted 5 of 5 sets of 10 repetitions at 30% of 1RM; 5 sets of 5 repetitions at 70% of 1RM; and 5 sets of 3 6 repetitions at 90% of 1RM. Average system power for each set was obtained with a tethered 7 external dynamometer. Pre-and post-exercise blood draws were analyzed for lactate, 8 testosterone, hGH, and cortisol. Muscle biopsies assessed pre-and post-exercise extracellular 9 signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 phosphorylation via western blotting. Cortisol, 10 hGH, and lactate increased post-exercise (p< 0.05), but did not differ between protocols (p> 0.05). 11 Testosterone was unaltered (p> 0.05). Average power was lower for the 90% protocol than for the 12 30% protocol across all sets (p< 0.01). Average power was lower after the fourth and fifth set 13 compared to the first and second set in the 90% protocol only (p< 0.05). The ratio of 14 phosphorylated-to-total ERK1/2 was higher post-exercise after 90% protocol only (p< 0.05). The 15 ratio of phosphorylated-to-total p38 was unaltered post-exercise (p> 0.05). Resistance load 16 appears to affect power fatigue across the five sets of resistance exercise. This study found 17 modest changes in ERK1/2 and no changes in p38 phosphorylation following maximal 18 concentric velocity squats. Exercise volume …

Surface electromyography signals were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) during an isometric trapezoidal muscle action with the steady force plateau set at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The signals were decomposed to yield MUAP sizes and RTs for each MU. The AP slope was calculated via the MUAP sizes vs. RT relationships for MUs recruited between 10 and 50% MVC for each subject. Few MUs with RTs< 10% MVC were observed in young or old and, thus, these MUs were excluded from the slope calculation. FDI cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) were quantified using ultrasonography. Possible differences in AP slope, CSA and EI between groups were examined with independent samples t-tests. RESULTS: OG demonstrated significantly …

Justin Nicoll |Beta2-Adrenergic Sensitivity Prior to Training is Related to ERK MAPK Down-regulation Following Resistance Exercise Overtraining.|Justin X Nicoll, Adam J Sterczala, Andrew C Fry|2016/5/1||48|5|453-453|LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS|Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) basal excretion, and beta2-adrenergic (β2) receptor content are altered after overtraining (OT). Recent literature implicates β2 signaling in the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and phenotype. β2 signaling in skeletal muscle involves the signaling protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). To date, no study has investigated the E-β2-ERK signaling axis in OT humans. PURPOSE: To determine if basal sensitivity of epinephrine (E/β2) and norepinephrine (NE/β2) were related to changes in ERK activity following a period of resistance exercise OT. METHODS: Sixteen males were randomized into an overtraining group (OT: n= 8, age= 20.6±2.1 yrs, ht= 179±10cm, body mass= 78.6±12.1 kg) or control group (CON n= 8, age= 19.8±1.7 yrs, ht= 179±6cm, body mass= 76.7±9.7 kg). The OT group performed 10 X 1 at 100% 1 RM daily for 2 wks. CON performed normal training 2 days/wk. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle and nocturnal urinary E and NE were assessed before (pre) and after (post) overtraining. Biopsies were analyzed for total-ERK and ratio of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) via western blotting. The ratio of pERK was corrected for changes in total-ERK content between pre and post training. Multiple regression was used to determine if E/β2 and NE/β2 (independent variables) were significantly related to changes in pERK (dependent variable) after training. Significance was set at p<. 05. RESULTS: When groups were analyzed together, E/β2 and NE/β2 at pre explained 64% of variance in the change of pERK at post (F [2, 13]= 14.4, p=. 001, adj. R 2=. 641). When analyzed …

METHODS: Twenty-five healthy (age= 21.5±1.9 years), recreationally active men and women completed one familiarization and three experimental visits, a minimum of 48 hours apart. Each visit consisted of a brief, standardized warmup, two submaximal CMJs, and three maximal CMJs performed on a force plate (sample rate= 1000Hz). Each jump was separated by two minutes. To reduce the variability associated with arm swing, all jumps were performed with subjects’ hands on their hips. The CMJ GRF waveform for each jump, beginning with the minimum GRF during the counter-movement and ending at take off, was interpolated and re-sampled to a uniform length of 1000 data points. Individual within and between day reliabilities for each subject’s waveform shapes were calculated using the …

During APS protocol, the rest period included 10 repetitions of seated cable rows (20RM load). RESULTS: The mean 1RM bench press, 80% 1RM bench press, and 20RM cable rows was 124.2±23.5 kg, 99.8±19.3 kg, and 51.0±7.24 kg, respectively. A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant decreases in volume for both TRA (set 1: 1632.7±386.4 kg; set 2: 1190.0±209.2 kg; set 3: 930.1±172.4 kg) and APS (set 1: 1579.1±332.8 kg; set 2: 1172.0±269.6 kg; set 3: 909.1±232.4 kg) as the sets progressed through the exercise session (p<. 001). These decreases were similar between both methods (p=. 471). There was not a significant interaction of volume between the APS and TRA groups (p=. 772). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there were no differences in volume between TRA and APS resistance session. The APS training appears to be a time efficient alternative to TRA resistance training.

Justin Nicoll |THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP, BURN OUT, AND PERFORMANCE IN COLLEGIATE FEMALE RUNNERS.|David J Sanders, Disa Hatfield, Justin Nicoll, Kathleen Melanson, Christopher Nasin, Deborah Riebe|||||||Overtraining (OT) frequently occurs in collegiate athletes. Currently, energy imbalance is considered the primary mechanisms responsible for OT. However, there is little research concerning potential early OT identifiers that coaches and athletes can easily monitor, such as sleep habits and daily fluctuations in fatigue. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between fatigue, sleep, perception of burn-out, and performance change over a track season in female collegiate runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field mid and long distance runners (age: 20.34±1.47 yrs; height: 165.17±6.08 cm; body mass: 57.06±5.44 kg; VO2MAX: 58.24±5.92 ml/kg/min) participated in a 14-week descriptive study. Sleep (latency, quality, disturbance, daytime dysfunction), burn-out (reduced accomplishment, emotional/physical exhaustion, devaluation), and fatigue surveys were measured pre-, mid-, and end of-season. Percent change in race time (season best vs. championship performance) was calculated and Spearman rank order correlations were run to assess possible relationships among the variables. Significance was set at p≤ 0.05. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between sleep latency and burn-out exhaustion pre-and mid-season (r= 0.555 and r= 0.558), sleep latency and performance mid-season (r=-. 729), and sleep related daytime dysfunction and all characteristics of burn-out end of-season (reduced accomplishment: r= 0.574; devaluement: r= 0.666; and exhaustion: r= 0.672). CONCLUSION: Monitoring sleep patterns and burn-out during a competitive season may be of use to coaches in order to … 
Justin Nicoll |Testing Modality is Vital to Determine Performance Changes in Overreaching Resistance Exercise|Justin Nicoll, Andrew C Fry, Loren ZF Chiu, Brian K Schilling|||||||CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise performance decrements were similar to previous investigations (1, 3). However, only dynamic RE (barbell squat) was sensitive enough to detect decreased performance compared to isometric RE (knee extension) in overreached subjects. Similarly, it appears power and velocity are more adversely affected by OR than measures of maximal force. Immediate mechanisms are not clear why only dynamic exercise was impaired in this study. Decreases in performance in the barbell exercise may be due to the greater reliance on more elaborate systems of neuromuscular coordination and muscle activation. This may further be supported by the finding that components of muscle performance that required higher speed output (power and velocity) were decreased in the barbell exercise. Periodically assessing power and velocity on barbell squats at 70% of 1-RM might be a useful tool for strength and weightlifting coaches during various stages of periodized programs to assess the efficacy of the implemented overload period.

Justin Nicoll |RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE MANUAL SIDE-LYING HIP ABDUCTION GLUTEUS MEDIUS ACTIVATION ASSESSMENT IN THE STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING FIELD|Justin Nicoll, Richard S Nadell, Disa L Hatfield|||||||Results ▪ The participants were graded on GM strength based previous criteria (1). The test was graded on a scale of 1-5. Grades 1 and 2 dealt with basic supine hip abduction they were not relevant and were not used in the study. Grades 3 to 5 indicate the participant’s ability to hold the leg against gravity, gravity plus moderate resistance or gravity plus maximum resistance. Therefore all participants were graded from 3-5 on strength of GM. ▪ Side lying hip abduction (Grade 3)-Side lying hip abduction (bottom leg bent). Leg extended at the kneed joint, slightly extended at the hip joint. Participant can abduct leg at the hip joint through full range of motion without backward movement of the pelvis, flexion or internal rotation of the hip. Side lying hip abduction (Grade 4, 5)-Same as grade 3 except with resistance from tester applied to the lateral aspect of the knee

Enterprises ranging from local restaurants to large multinational corporations are susceptible to a wide spectrum of time-consuming and potentially expensive legal and management problems without having developed and implemented detailed and thoughtful policies regarding the use of and participation in social media by employees. These policies must then be incorporated into the fabric of the enterprise, regularly updated and communicated as part of a consistent program of training and compliance. 
Nanci Carr |Intellectual Property Issues Associated with Biorepositories: Current Practices|Nanci Carr|2014/8/1|Atlantic Law Journal|16||||As technological innovation over the last 20 years has offered ever more opportunity for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic inventions at the genomic and proteomic level, the leading edge of medical research today is increasingly found slicing through large collections of biospecimens held in government, university and private repositories. Specimens are collected from a variety of human sources for a particular purpose and then stored for future research and study. Beyond the ethical and regulatory considerations that are rich with conflicting public interests, the determination of who owns the potentially valuable intellectual property rights must be weighed against the unfettered need to promote further research and innovation that follows from data sharing and timely disclosure of results and inventions. With that in mind, what are the current practices regarding the disposition of intellectual property rights, or economic interests therein, that arise out of the study of human tissue specimens held in biorepositories and the use of the biologic information each of those specimens contains?

Stuart Pardau |Alternative Litigation Financing: Perils and Opportunities|Stuart L Pardau|2011|UC Davis Bus. LJ|12||65||Alternative litigation finance (" ALF") applies to situations where a claimant accepts funding for litigation from an unrelated third party. Although this arrangement provides relief to claimants who otherwise are unable to afford legal representation, it poses the possible danger of unfair influence exercised by ALF providers through the use of usurious interest rates and unconscionable terms of the agreement. Other legal issues that arise out of the context of ALF involve champerty, maintenance, and barratry, depending on the jurisdiction. The release of confidential client information to ALF providers may constitute waive of the attorney-client privilege. Attorneys even face conflict of interest issues between their clients and ALF providers, and as a result, they may lose independence in their professional judgment. Furthermore, ethical rules prohibit an attorney from splitting fees with non-attorneys. Despite these legal …

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg |It's a Nuisance: The Future of Fracking Litigation in the Wake of Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.|Hilary M Goldberg, Melanie Stallings Williams, Deborah Cours|2015|Va. Envtl. LJ|33||1||Hydraulic fracturing, or" fracking," is a polarizing topic, having earned both staunch advocates who see its possibilities for the domestic production of energy and ardent opponents who anticipate dire consequences resulting from its environmental impact. The practice has resulted in over one hundred lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, none of which have gone to verdict prior to the recent jury decision in Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc. 1 Because its result did not rest on a conclusion that the practice of fracking itself constituted a compensable wrong, Parr neither vindicated the oil and gas industry by exonerating it nor validated critics of fracking. Instead, the decision, based on a single cause of action of intentional private nuisance, demonstrated that juries were willing to find in favor of private plaintiffs even without a showing that fracking itself resulted in direct harm to the lives and property of those living nearby. The jury …

Pol'y|32||183||Whether or not a property owner is required to disclose to prospective purchasers a death, felony, or other traumatic event on her real property depends, almost entirely, upon where the property is located. Indeed, while many fundamental aspects of Real Estate Law are consistent nationwide, the requirements imposed upon sellers to disclose a death or other psychological element affecting the property vary by state. The proliferation and success of websites, such as DiedInHouse. com, which, for a fee, will provide a report of all deaths that occurred on a particular property, suggest that consumers nationwide want to know whether there has been a death on the property. Countless stories of perpetually vacant homes following notable deaths and violent crimes reinforce this notion.

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg |Stealing Time: The Propriety of Alleging Common Law Conversion in Modern Wage Theft Lawsuits|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg, Paul Silvia|2017||||||The words “wage theft” frequently make headlines when workers sue employers for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. Wage theft is “the illegal refusal by an employer to pay a worker the wages and benefits that he or she has legally earned.” In the United States, employer violation of wage and hour laws is a vast and enduring problem affecting as many as two-thirds of workers. In an attempt to combat this epidemic threat to hourly workers’ bottom lines, legislatures have fashioned numerous laws, some even invoking the power of “wage theft” terminology, such as New York’s Wage Theft Prevention Act. However, despite the pervasive usage of the term “wage theft” by the media, politicians, and pundits, a search of the term “wage theft” in legal libraries yields little precedent. This begs the question: can employers be liable for conversion for failing to compensate employees for time-spent working? The efficacy of conversion claims in wage-related lawsuits remains an unsettled question. However, if as a society, we are sounding the alarm in every incidence of possible wage and hour law violations, we ultimately misinform the population of potential plaintiffs regarding the viability of a claim for theft, or conversion, of earned yet unpaid wages.

In this paper, we present a theoretical perspective on the management of flexibility of a type of system called a System of Systems (SoS). We first define flexibility as it has been described with respect to the management of a system, how this may relate to SoS and establish that there is a deficiency for understanding how the SoS should be managed near the optimization region of flexibility. We then propose a theoretical model for managing flexibility in a SoS that begins to address this optimization region of flexibility. We demonstrate our model with an empirical case study of the New York City Yellow Cab SoS and conclude with potential …

Consequently, the shareholders priorities of return and risk continuously shift. However, their expectations of gaining value from the SoS are enhancing. One way of enhancing value from the SoS is by having the right amount of flexibility associated with it. Flexibility can be defined as the ability of a system to be able to adapt and cope with the changing environment. SoS flexibility means creating options at various levels, developing ways and means of change across the range of options. One possible way of creating enterprise flexibility is by outsourcing certain functions which would help affect the flexibility of an organization. The outsourcing done might also have an effect on each of the building blocks of SoS Flexibility. In this paper, we will look at how outsourcing could affect each of the …

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Social Entrepreneurial Ventures: On the Edge of Chaos?|Colleen Robb, S Jimmy Gandhi|2016/1/1|Entrepreneurship Research Journal|6|1|111-133|De Gruyter|This paper proposes that social entrepreneurial ventures (SEVs) operate as systems of systems (SoS), a collection of complex systems working together to achieve an overall outcome in line with its mission. Previous literature shows that complexity theory is applicable to the unique structure of SEVs and the dual goals of creating economic and social value. We argue that not only are SEVs complex systems, but also operate as a SoS. As such, SEVs could greatly benefit from a general systemic risk management approach that is often applied to SoS. In order to explain our position, we consider an example of an existing SEV and apply these concepts to their operations. We also identify systemic risks in the example and show how the application of a systemic risk management approach can benefit SEVs.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|A Systemic Approach to Adopting Effective Management Styles Based on Typology of Systems|Mo Mansouri, Alex Gorod, Brian Sauser, S Jimmy Gandhi|2009/10/14||||||Systems in today’s business environment have been categorized into certain forms based on their characteristics. The typology of systems based on flexibility is an example of such efforts in literature. However, more research on choosing effective styles for managing each category based on the right degree of freedom and level of control is required. In this paper, the spectrum of existing managerial approaches is described. Understanding available methodologies helps decision makers to select a more appropriate management style for the specific category of system. To do that, the four categories of systems based on flexibility are analyzed and mapped with the existing management styles, which are identified and described in this research. The proposed method can increase the overall effectiveness of management practices in the field of engineering management. The mapping approach proposed in this research can also decrease the complexity associated with management techniques in modern dynamic environment.

Expo., ASEE, New Orleans, USA|||27136||Career Pathways is a Workforce Development (WFD) program that is supported by State government to instill specific skillsets in K-12 students. Career pathways generally consist of partnerships between K-12 school districts, community colleges, four-year universities and community-based workforce investment boards. The overall goal is to bridge the gap between industry-needed skills and those obtained through formal education. The expected outcome is the transition of students into industry after high school, transfer into a community college, or seek a four-year college degree. Regardless of the career pathway outcome, the WFD program inculcates hands-on, practical skills in participants. These skills were included based on industry feedback about the gap between current graduates’ skills and those expected in the field of practice. The skills were also echoed in the ‘Engineer of 2020’report by the National Academy of Engineering. As a result, the career pathways include programs and services that addresses aforementioned skill gap and increases the employability of students; particularly in the hightech industry. The overall emphasis of this effort is on the engineering profession, in which the responsibilities and expectations from an employee in the 21st century are significantly different from those required decades ago.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|A comprehensive review of entrepreneurship course offering in engineering programs|S Gandhi, MB Jimmy, S Taghazadeh|2016|Proceedings|||||Entrepreneurship education is becoming increasingly important in engineering schools. This is a trend that started several years ago in the US and is also spreading internationally. This trend appears to be due to the fact that engineers are responsible for providing solutions to enhance the quality of life for people worldwide and for facing the challenges related to that responsibility. As society develops we face new challenges, which call for varied and innovative approaches to solve these problems. This is further confirmed by the National Academy of Engineers’ book titled “The Engineer of 2020”, which the clearly discusses the changing role of the engineer in 2020 7. This process of evolving as a profession cannot be achieved unless an entrepreneurial mindset is created amongst the engineers of 2020 and beyond. To foster this entrepreneurial mindset, engineering programs are undertaking various initiatives. However, there is no clear agreement regarding the entrepreneurship content that should be included for engineers. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Innovation and entrepreneurship in global markets-an initial identification of the divide that can exist between countries|S Jimmy Gandhi, MD Wilson, Dirk Hecht, Gunter Hofbauer, Tom Hope, Ramalatha Marimuthu, Akin Olufowoshe|2014|Proceedings of the International Annual Conference of the American Society for Engineering Management.|||1|American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM)|Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist who first coined the word entrepreneur in about 1800, said:" The entrepreneur shifts economic resources out of an area of lower productivity into an area of higher productivity and greater yield." This shiftof" economic resources" within geographical boundaries are usually influenced by factors" local" to the immediate environment of the economic activities. In addition, movement of resources to achieve" higher productivity and greater yield" requires a" natural" understanding of the interrelationship between capital and labor. Application of such understanding to solve a particular human problem is often referred to as innovation. The entrepreneur is a business leader who looks for ideas and puts them into effect thereby fostering economic growth and development of a region. And entrepreneurship is one of the most important inputs for the economic development of a country … 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|An Implementation of Innovative Thinking in The Entrepreneurship Cur-riculum for Engineers|S Jimmy Gandhi|2014|age|24||1||One of the challenges that engineers have is to think outside the box and be innovative. As part of this effort to instill innovation and creative thinking in engineers as well as update the entrepreneurship curriculum, the authors have implemented various topics on innovative thinking into the curriculum. These topics include Lateral Thinking as well as 6 Thinking Hats Applications. These topics were included in the Fall 2013 entrepreneurship syllabus and have received positive feedback from the students. In this paper, the authors will talk about what aspects were included in the curriculum and how they can provide value by being included in the curriculum. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Entrepreneurship Education: Engineering a Pracademic Approach|MD Wilson, Eric Holloway, S Jimmy Gandhi|2014||||||Innovation and entrepreneurship are becoming increasingly important as we rely on economies to create jobs around the globe. And yet, considering the myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21st century and ever increasing consumer power, the risk of entrepreneurial activity has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner and fundamentally change the teaching methods, curriculum, and research in entrepreneurship education. Applying the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to entrepreneurship with similar rigor can increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. Still, faculty and administrators of engineering programs are hesitant to introduce courses into an engineering curriculum outside of engineering fundaments. The paradox, however, is that non-core engineering courses including leadership and engineering management can help students develop highly desired attributes that contribute to career and industry success. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Curriculum design for sustainability of globally integrated manufacturing|Bingbing Li, S Jimmy Gandhi, Li Ding|2015|age|26||1||Integrating the scalable nanotechnologies into existing industrial systems is highly beneficial for improving the quality, capability and performance of almost all kinds of industrial sectors. However, significant sustainability issues and challenges exist in the practical integration and subsequent operations of the integrated macro-nano industrial systems, including increased waste generations, extra energy consumptions, additional greenhouse gas emissions, novel nanoparticle emissions for occupational and public exposure, etc. This paper will analyze which competence domains, a curriculum towards sustainable manufacturing should have and how a certificate program in “Sustainable Manufacturing” can be accomplished. This curriculum design is based on the experience of creating and teaching new graduate level courses “Sustainable Manufacturing” at Texas Tech University and “Energy Efficiency and Industrial Sustainability” at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. All segments of society must be educated to understand, environmental, economic and social connections within manufacturing systems engineering to facilitate sustainability. The innovations in technology and management play a fundamental role in solving the global challenge in economic development, while simultaneously preserving life, conserving natural resources and creation of social justice. This pilot study could be a pioneer for further countries in the world such as China, Indian, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which would be interested in implementing sustainable manufacturing.

In fact, entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as national assets to be cultivated and motivated to the greatest possible extent. In today’s global economy, exciting opportunities for cross border trade exist like never before. As a result of this, international entrepreneurship and innovation have come to the forefront of discussions in recent times. International entrepreneurship can be defined as “… the process of an entrepreneur conducting business activities across national boundaries.” Alternatively, it can also be defined as,“… a combination of innovative, proactive and risk seeking behavior that crosses national borders and is intended to create value within organizations.” For international entrepreneurship, there are a slew of factors that have to be taken into consideration such as economics, type of economic system, political-legal environment, culture, acceptance to risk etc. In addition to understanding entrepreneurship in other countries, it is important for local entrepreneurs to understand the kinds of practices that lead to innovations in other countries. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Towards Understanding the Effects of Outsourcing on the Flexibility Dynamic of System of Systems|S Jimmy Gandhi, Alex Gorod, Brian Sauser|2014||||137-147|Springer, New Delhi|The requirements of various stakeholders associated with System of Systems (SoS) are constantly changing. Consequently, the shareholders’ priorities of return and risk continuously shift. However, their expectations of gaining value from the SoS are enhancing. One way of enhancing value from the SoS is by having the right amount of flexibility associated with it. Flexibility can be defined as the ability of a system to be able to adapt and cope with the changing environment. SoS flexibility means creating options at various levels, developing ways and means of change across the range of options. One possible way of creating enterprise flexibility is by outsourcing certain functions which would help affect the flexibility of an organization. The outsourcing done might also have an effect on each of the building blocks of SoS flexibility. In this chapter, we will look at how outsourcing could affect …

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|AC 2012-4002: APPLICATION OF CASE STUDIES TO ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING EDUCATION|S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||As engineering system complexity has increased over the years, numerous complex systems projects have failed due to the lack of an appropriate systemic perspective. Since the solution to this challenge is itself a complex system, educating and training our current and future technical leaders on these challenges, and providing suggested changes in their mind sets, is imperative. As an educational tool, case studies can be a platform through which the analysis, knowledge application, and drawing of conclusions can occur to facilitate coping with the most complex systems. Case study learning has proven successful in the training of business leaders with real life examples of the strategies and tactics used by leading businesses to succeed globally. A valuable characteristic of case studies is that they support a holistic understanding and interpretation of the systems of action or interrelated activities engaged in by the participants. However, case studies are not as broadly used in engineering management and systems engineering education. This paper describes the importance of case studies to engineering management and systems engineering education, discusses frameworks for their implementation, and presents a case study template that can be used as a guideline in engineering education.

And yet, considering myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21 st century and the increasing power the consumer controls, the risk of doing entrepreneurship has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner to be able to confront new-age entrepreneurship in a new light and thus increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. In this paper, the authors will talk about a potential new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship education for engineers in the 21st millennium. This approach will focus on inclusive, key concepts from Quality Management, Systems Engineering, Globalization and Sustainability for the Entrepreneurship curriculum, as these are topics that need to be understood by potential entrepreneurs to be successful. A new curriculum that can be taught as a workshop or as courses in the entrepreneurship domain will be developed subsequently and presented as part of this paper.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|An Implementation of Continuous Improvement of The Engineering Man-agement Program at California State University, Northridge|S Jimmy Gandhi, Ahmad R Sarfaraz||age|24||1||More than two-thirds of all engineering professionals invest a significant portion of their career in managing and administering a wide range of technical engineering and research projects and budgets (CSUN 2012). As the engineering profession evolves, an increasing need has emerged for entry-level engineering professionals who have both a broad engineering background and the knowledge and ability to interface between the business and technical functions of organizations. It was to meet this demand that university X, introduced an EM program at the undergraduate level effective Fall 2009. Undergraduate engineering management majors learn engineering fundamentals, together with the art and science of planning, organizing, allocating resources, and directing and controlling activities in technological environments. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management equips entry-level engineers with knowledge of the business of engineering, making them valuable to their employers and ensuring future professional growth. For students who enjoy people and technology, the technical challenges of engineering, and the opportunity to integrate higher-level organizational considerations into technological decision-making processes, engineering management is an ideal program of study (CSUN 2014),(Becker, 2007).

This course curriculum design and research will include mapping engineering management courses between the Engineering Management Departments at Texas Tech University and California State University, Northridge and creating distributed project teams, by virtue of which the students would be compelled to work both traditionally (intra-university) and virtually (inter-university) and learn about managing partially distributed teams. Pedagogically, the researchers/professors will also be compiling information and lessons learned in coordination of this inter-university educational endeavor.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Evaluation of Intellectual Property Course Offerings for undergraduate engineering students in the Mid Atlantic Region|S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||For more than half a century the United States has led the world in scientific discovery and innovation. However, in today’s rapidly evolving competitive world, the United States can no longer take its supremacy for granted. The decline of the United States’ share of intellectual property (IP) is one indication of its loss of competitiveness. According to studies carried out by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004, the United States is losing its dominance in the fields of science and innovation. In January 2008 the NSF again noticed the decline in US technological dominance. Because innovative ideas tend to be developed by younger engineers or scientists, an area that cries out is the improvement of undergraduate engineers who are currently illiterate in IP, in general, and of the role of IP in innovation, in particular.

Bingbing Li|Life Cycle Assessment of Lithium Ion Batteries with Silicon Nanowire Anode for Electric Vehicles|Bingbing Li, Jianyang Li, Chris Yuan|2013|IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems & Technology (ISSST 2013). doi: DOI|10||m9||While silicon nanowires have demonstrated great potential for application on lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles, their environmental impacts have never been investigated. For a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has to be used to evaluate the potential impact of the product from cradle to grave. In this paper, the LCA is carried out on the environmental impacts of a high performance lithium ion battery system with silicon nanowire anode. The LCA modeling is based on laboratory data, literature references and the Gabi 6 Professional Database on a 43.2 kWh battery system for an EV with 10 year life. The environmental impacts of lithium ion battery system are analyzed in the whole life cycle. Introduction: Electric vehicles (EVs) are more environmental friendly than conventional internal-combustion-engine powered vehicles and are expected to be used in large fleet vehicle applications in the following several decades worldwide. It has been predicted that the global market for EVs will expand from 1.2 m in 2010 to 6.1 m in 2015 and to 19.8 m in 2020 (Watabe, 2011). Current EVs are powered by lithium ion batteries. Current lithium ion batteries are made of graphite anode which has a relatively small specific capacity (372 mAh/g), and accordingly, can only power the EV for a limited driving range. In comparison, silicon has a high theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh/g) and has been widely recognized as the ideal anode active material for next generation high capacity lithium ion batteries (Chan, 2008). Such novel lithium ion batteries, in theory, can power electric vehicles for up to 10 times the … 
Bingbing Li|Design and Analysis of Shape Memory Polymer snap-Fits for Active Disassembly|John Carrell, Hong-Chao Zhang, Derrick Tate, Chengcheng Fan, Bingbing Li|2009||||||Disassembly is becoming a mandatory step in the end-of-life processing for electronic products. More and more regulations call for the removal of hazardous materials and mandate the recovery of components and recyclable materials. It is then no surprise that research has continually looked for more efficient methods of disassembly. Of these methods, active disassembly is at the forefront. Active disassembly incorporates innovative fasteners, which under a special environmental condition will exhibit a disassembling or releasing action. The use of smart materials, more specifically shape memory alloys and shape memory polymers, has been extensively documented. For shape memory polymers, past research has shown innovative designs, such as thread-losing screws and deformable brackets. What has not been shown with shape memory polymers, however, is one of the most basic and common fasteners-the snap-fit. This paper examines the design and processing method for creating a shape memory polymer snap-fit and demonstrates its effectiveness as an actively disassembling fastener.

Bingbing Li|Backtracking algorithm-based disassembly sequence planning|Bingbing Li, Li Ding, Mark Rajai, Di Hu, Shengzi Zheng|2018/1/1|Procedia CIRP|69||932-937|Elsevier|Disassembly sequence planning (DSP) is one of the core research themes of product life cycle design. Effective DSP can reduce product life cycle costs as well as their environmental effects and provides a theoretical future foundation for recycling and improving sustainability performance. The problem with current heuristic artificial intelligence algorithms is that the outcome may have a local extremum; therefore, it may not generate the exact or even the approximate optimum solution. For a specific sequence planning problem, some algorithm parameters need to be adjusted in order to generate a perfect solution. In this study, the objective is to create new DSP by integrating a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) based on backtracking algorithms. First, the relationship between DSP and the CSP was analysed. Then, the DSP was converted into a CSP based on a disassembly constraint graph (DCG). The solution … 
Bingbing Li|Influence of Preheating Temperature on Mechanical Properties of Laser Cladding Layer|Jibin Jiang, Guofu Lian, Mingsan Xu, Chunyu Li, Bingsan Chen, Bingbing Li|2016/6/27||||V001T02A031-V001T02A031|American Society of Mechanical Engineers|Physical and chemical changes always occur in the process of laser cladding, and the cladding quality is directly affected by processing parameters. This paper mainly focused on effects of temperature field of preheating substrate on the cladding quality. Laser cladding process has the following experimental parameters: laser power, powder feeding rate and rotational speed. Three types of cladding powders were used: Ni60A, Cr12MoV and WC-Co. Experiments were conducted by using different substrate preheating temperatures and cladding materials, which affect the quality of cladding layers. Comparison and analysis of the three types of powders showed that under different preheating temperatures, the cladding layer is mainly affected by tensile stress. Besides that, the residual stress of cladding layer is always higher than that of heat affected zone and substrates. The best preheating temperature to test the residual stress for three types of powders are: 600℃, 400℃ and 300℃. For all three types of powders under different preheating temperatures, cladding layer and substrate have compact and uniform structures. However, when substrate is overheated the cracking will occur in the substrate. Under different preheating temperatures, the Vickers hardness is higher than that of heat affected zone and the substrate for all three materials. The preheating temperatures for getting the maximum hardness are respectively 300℃, 600℃ and 400℃.

Bingbing Li|An surplus asset management model for environmental impact analysis of EOL electronic products|Xueqing Qian, Hong-Chao Zhang, Bingbing Li|2009/1/1||||127-133|American Society of Mechanical Engineers|With increasing environmental regulations and waste management costs, environmentally conscious design and manufacturing (ECDM) and surplus asset recovery are becoming a more attractive approach to solve environmental problems. Any company that owns a collection of PCs, printers and other electronic accessories probably needs to manage these assets more effectively, but currently there is a lack of tools for effective management. Therefore, this paper discusses, from the viewpoint of an enterprise dealing with end-of-life electronic products, the recycling processes according to literature, and derives an integrated model on surplus asset management and environmental impact analysis. The primary objective of the model is to develop a certain tool for managing surplus asset within a corporate office and generate a decision making tool for those who are concerned with the environmental issues in the design or recycling phase. Based on this model, a prototype system is introduced in detail in this paper.

Bingbing Li|3D BIOPRINTING OF SCAFFOLD STRUCTURE USING MICRO-EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGY|Juan Xing, Xianli Luo, Juliana Bermudez, Matthew Moldthan, Bingbing Li|2017||||||Scaffold-based techniques are a vital assistance tool to support main structure and enhance the resolution of target structure. In this study, a custom-made micro-extrusion bioprinting system was built and utilized to fabricate different scaffold structures such as log-pile scaffold and two-ring scaffold. This approach showed tremendous potential because of its ability to produce microscale channels with almost any shape. We were able to fabricate these scaffolds by using a custom-made 3D bioprinter to print hydrogel solution, mostly composed of Pluronic F-127, then wash away hydrogen by phosphate buffer saline (PBS) after crosslinking of main structure. We were able to achieve the desired scaffold structure by feeding G-codes data into user interface (Pronterface) and then translating that model into a program that utilizes a customized programming language, which instructs the microfabrication printer nozzles to dispense the hydrogel at specific locations. This fundamental study will be used to print increasingly viable and complex tissue shapes with living cells.

Bingbing Li|Energy-saving Optimal Design Based on Transfer Function|Qingdi Ke, Hong-chao Zhang, Guangfu Liu, Bingbing Li|||||||Nowadays, in most of the product design, the designers have been emphasized with attention being given to the energy saving. Unfortunately, due to the diversiform and transformable energy, it is well know that energysaving designs are mostly depends on the experiments and experience which are time and money consuming. In the most product, since the efficiency of the energy sources and action mechanisms have been significantly improved, the energy consuming depends on the its transfer in the product. In this paper, the energy transfer between the energy source and action mechanism is analyzed and quantified, and the transfer function is established with the Band graphs theory. Then, informed by the control theory, the transfer function could be classified, and the important variable which is usually called “transfer parameters” in this function could be educed. Furthermore, with the adjusting the transfer parameters, the balance of input and output could be optimized for the least unwanted energy consuming in the energy transfer. Finally, the model and the method in this paper are validated by an instance of the typical mechanism.

Mark Rajai|Globalization of engineering curricula in the United States and abroad|Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Seyed M Allameh, Mark Rajai|2005|age|10||1||With globalization of corporations and multinational industrial complexes, engineering students need the expertise necessary to face the challenges presented to them as the result of globalization. Engineering curricula are affected as the result of globalization. Modern engineering needs to address new concepts in team management, communication skills, and problem solving. Outsourcing practices and NAFTA initiatives have further intensified the globalization of science and industry to unanticipated levels. A study will be conducted to examine innovative methods and practices undertaken by engineering schools across the United States and to create curricular paradigms such as the Global Engineering College (GEC) or virtual engineering college. The findings of this study will include the challenges these institutions face exploring and implementing the innovative concepts that they have undertaken.

These needs have created the opportunity for this proposed project. Here product teams must design and manufacture new products where the team members are not co-located in the same place at the same time [2]. It is important to introduce this into the classroom, because virtual interactions are becoming increasingly important as separated teams jointly develop products. Over the last few years, two problems have evolved in the teaching of new product development. First, one course was not enough to stimulate product creativity. The teams needed more instruction and experiential learning in order to develop innovative products with high market potential. Second, LMU's graduate students have had great difficulty meeting together in colocated teams due to their busy schedules, off-site travel in their jobs and driving long distances in traffic in order to meet with their teams. These problems could be solved by designing twosemester courses in new product development and entrepreneurship that utilized the internet for team collaboration. In this way the students would have more time to nurture creative products. Furthermore, the teams would be able to interact at their own convenience, which would enable them to save time by not having to meet as often as a co-located team. 
Mark Rajai|A survivability model for ejection of green compacts in powder metallurgy technology|Payman Ahi, Kouroush Jenab, Ahmad Ghasempoor, M Rajabi|2012|International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations|3|1|15-24||Reliability and quality assurance have become major considerations in the design and manufacture of today’s parts and products. Survivability of green compact using powder metallurgy technology is considered as one of the major quality attributes in manufacturing systems today. During powder metallurgy (PM) production, the compaction conditions and behavior of the metal powder dictate the stress and density distribution in the green compact prior to sintering. These parameters greatly influence the mechanical properties and overall strength of the final component. In order to improve these properties, higher compaction pressures are usually employed, which make unloading and ejection of green compacts more challenging, especially for the powder-compacted parts with relatively complicated shapes. This study looked at a mathematical survivability model concerning green compact characteristics in PM technology and the stress-strength failure model in reliability engineering. This model depicts the relationship between mechanical loads (stress) during ejection, experimentally determined green strength and survivability of green compact. The resulting survivability is the probability that a green compact survives during and after ejection. This survivability model can be used as an efficient tool for selecting the appropriate parameters for the process planning stage in PM technology. A case study is presented here in order to demonstrate the application of the proposed survivability model. 
Mark Rajai|Using database technology to improve STEM student retention: A total quality management approach to early alert and intervention|S Khoury, K Jenab, D Staub, M Rajai|2002|Management Science Letters|2|2|647-654||Students at risk of dropping out of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs often display signs that indicate they are at risk. A need exists to identify at risk STEM students early and to develop and implement effective intervention strategies that utilize the Total Quality Management (TQM) approach. Most of all, a database system is needed to track this early intervention process, if retention rates are to be improved. To address this need at a small community college in North Carolina, a system was developed and underwent a pilot study in Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. The two pilot groups were compared to the two control groups to identify differences in retention, course credit completion rates, and grade point averages (GPA). The first pilot group displayed no significant differences, while the second pilot group displayed significant differences in most of the areas analyzed in the study, indicating a database system can be used to improve STEM student retention. While the second of the two pilot groups displayed promising results, managerial and logistical issues, such as less than optimal instructor involvement, impeded success were identified. This paper will describe the design, implementation, and the preliminary results of this study and outlines the need for further research that confirms these preliminary findings.

Furthermore, each one of these scenarios was investigated for linear and circular configurations. First, the lower bounds of cycle time for such robotic cells were studied regarding varied structures, and then optimal cycle times were acquired. Finally, linear layout was compared with circular layout. 
Mark Rajai|Effects of Outsourcing and the State of Economy on Employers Hiring Practices of Engineering Graduates|Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Mark Rajai|2004|age|9||1||With the current sluggish world economy, manufacturers are resorting to several tactics to maintain lean budgets. Among these tactics are outsourcing engineering and scientific jobs to nations overseas. Another, is employing only those workers who can satisfy their immediate needs. These practices have economic implications for the employers since employment decisions are determined solely by the profit/loss calculations in a time economic exigency. It also has economic implications for engineering graduates in search for jobs with salaries commensurate to their education and skills. This paper will combine the results of a survey conducted by the authors on this subject with information from recently published studies. Literature and data gathered will be organized and tabulated to find correlations between manufacturing employers’ economic outlook and their hiring practices. The results will provide insight into the availability of jobs for students majoring in engineering-related degrees. 
Mark Rajai|“Student in the University”: A Format for Retaining Students in Engineering Technology|Keith V Johnson, Mark Rajai|2000/6|age|5||1||Student in the university is a freshman orientation course in the Department of Engineering Technology at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) that was developed during the summer of 1994. The course initially was an elective course that became very popular with our freshman students. Because of its popularity, it became a required course for all freshmen with less than thirty credit hours. The focus of the course was and is to foster relationships with students and faculty, help students verify their decision to choose engineering technology or help them at least make informed decisions centered on choosing a major. The course uses a variety of teaching strategies and innovative approaches of instructions to attract and retain students in the field. This manuscript details many of the approaches that are used in the course that has been proven successful. Due to the versatile content of this course, we believe other programs with similar orientation courses could benefit from our experience.

Measuring long-term input versus output in a country’s economy could provide sufficient data for measuring the efficiency in that economy in comparison to other economies. This study compared Saudi Arabia’s long-term economic efficiency versus Turkey, Malaysia, Israel and the USA, as a benchmark. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia falls behind other nations in all seven measurements, which is a significant inefficiency in the Kingdom’s economy. Analysing solutions such as improving energy efficiency, privatisation, education, governance and transparency are discussed in this paper. 
Mark Rajai|Development of microtesting systems: I. Tensile testing of metallic microsamples|Seyed M Allameh, Morteza Sadat Hossieny, Mark Rajai|2005|age|10||1||This paper describes procedures adopted for the development of microtesters, including microtensile and microfatigue testing systems. Small structures are known to exhibit superior mechanical properties attributed to their finer microstructure. This includes stress-life response at low and high cycle fatigue. The fatigue life of small structures involves crack initiation and crack propagation stages. While the crack initiation stage is known to be a significant component of fatigue life, experimental verification of its impact has not been performed. Using the compliance response of small LIGA Ni structures in load control mode and under cyclic loading conditions, the contributions of crack initiation and propagation to fatigue life were quantified. Instrumentation details of the development of microtesters, including the use of PID functions of Labview®, IMAQ Vision®, a piezoelectric actuator, and the results of fatigue tests will be discussed.

Many researchers and designers have wanted a CAD-based ergonomic program for some time, and the absence of a truly integrated system was the motivating factor for program development. This paper explains the steps taken to integrate these two software packages. Designers now have an ergonomic CAD system to help design products according to the physical abilities and characteristics of end users. This integrated technology can potentially revolutionize the way products are designed and significantly reduce the alarming number of related injuries, thus saving millions of dollars.

The model represents a manufacturer of multiple products from multiple raw materials that has control over the price of the products. The decisions to be optimized in the model are ordering policies of raw materials, inventory control of finished goods, manufacturing capacity of each product, and prices set on the products. The uncertainties involved are lead times of ordering inventory and the demand of the products. We consider the case of periodic review of raw materials and finished goods inventories on discrete time. The objective is to find the best configuration of the system to maximize profit. We show how simulation-based optimization could find the best configuration through an example.

Mark Rajai|DEVELOPMENT OF AN AHP-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING A PROJECT MANAGER|Seyed F Montazeri, Ahmad R Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai, Robert A Matthews|2011|TRY ACAMEDICS!|||83||Assigning projects to project managers is one of the most important activities in an organization. It can strongly affect the performance of organizations or the results of their teams. Most projects are normally assigned to project managers according to their expertise and experiences in organizations. In this study, the authors looked at a model based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assign a project manager. It is based on the quantitative and qualitative managerial competencies of people who are candidates for becoming team leaders and project managers. This approach is more efficient when the scope of the project is broad and none of the functional departments take the lead over the project. In this case, the methodology can make the work of assigning a project to a project manager more scientific and fair. Also presented is a subject illustrated case for selecting the best project manager for a given project out of four candidates.

Mark Rajai|DEVELOPMENT OF A MODIFIED HEURISTIC METHOD TO OPTIMIZE A SINGLE MACHINE OPERATION|Mark R Rajai, Morteza Sadat Hossieney|2007|The International Journal of Applied Management and Technology|||6||This study is an extension of “A Heuristic Algorithm for Sequencing on One Machine to Minimize Total Tardiness” developed by JE Holsenback and RM Russell. They utilized a powerful theorem of Emmons to introduce a heuristic method, which uses Net Benefit of Relocation (NBR) analysis to determine which job should be placed in last position to reduce total tardiness of the schedule. Although their unique and simple algorithm resulted in optimal solution in many cases, it provided only sub-optimal solutions when the problem set possessed a multi-nodal earliest due date (EDD). We modified their algorithm by employing three new approaches in such a situations, resulting in average 15% improvement. we also extended their algorithm to include weighted factors (jobs with varying importance) associated with each job. The Modified Net Benefit of Relocation (MNBR) algorithm to minimize total tardiness on a single machine is introduced. Two examples employing the MNBR approach are also presented. 
Mark Rajai|Mass customization and its curricular implications for four-year degree programs in manufacturing technologies|Radha Balamuralikrishna, Kurt A Rosentrater, Mark Rajai|2006/10/20||||19-21||Mass customization is fast emerging as a popular business strategy which aims to also cater to individual expressed needs of end users at prices closely comparable to mass produced items. Companies are able to switch to this mode of operation by primarily making their own operations demand-driven, flexible systems and asking their suppliers to do the same. Customers by and large are delighted to be part of this new kind of supply chain and are willing to invest time to specify what exactly they want provided businesses are willing to keep their end of the bargain in terms of high quality, timeliness and prompt service. The probability of manufacturing technology graduates encountering demand-driven manufacturing systems that operate on a mass customization paradigm is very high per current indicators. This paper concludes with a synopsis of certain imperatives for inclusion in a detailed examination of the curricula in four year degree programs. Specifically, we suggest that students should be prepared to perform value stream analysis, work towards developing a firm’s core competency, and be able to analyze and improve supply chain operations. 
Mark Rajai|2006-2105: DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTER-UNIVERSITY ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION COURSE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY|Mark Rajai, Hank Javan, Seyed Allameh, Horold Wiebe|2006|age|11||1||Instrumentation is one of the most important courses of engineering curriculum. Almost all programs in engineering technology at undergraduate level offer labs and instrumentation. Also, most of the textbooks on instrumentation are written for undergraduate programs.

Mark Rajai|Cooperative Education-Innovative Approaches for Partnerships between Universities and Industries and High Schools|Ali Kashef, Mark Rajai, Akbar Eslami, Ali Setoodehnnia|2005|age|10||1||Over the last few years, continuous learning has become an essential element of job success, and workplace learning linked to career development has become part of the educational system of the future. Today, many industries are increasingly depending on cooperative education (co-op) and internship programs with universities, colleges and sometimes with high schools. However, they do not perceive how to start one or what is expected from them. In some cases, high schools aren’t aware of how to establish good relations and better communication with the industry. Some department chairs or administrators don’t recognize the role of co-op in the academy, or else they decide to overlook it. Therefore, co-op with a clear expectation and assessment should be part of student educational experience. Educators, students and industries will all gain substantial benefits from their involvement in this process. The objective of this paper is to make the university and high schools’ educators aware of the opportunities they could offer their students in industrial area. Students have the chance to experience the real world of industry with hands on experience simultaneously with the education they receive at school.

Mark Rajai|Development of a Virtual Center for Product innovation and Commercialization|Mark Rajai, Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Robert Matthews|2003|age|10||1||It is estimated that nearly 90% of all new businesses fail within the first five years. Failure of these businesses is often contributed to poor planning and management of the company. Although there is help available for new businesses, it is often very basic and not enough to assist new companies to grow and survive in the competitive global marketplace of today. Therefore, a need exists for a comprehensive resource center to provide various assistance to new companies. The Virtual Center for Product Innovation and Commercialization (CPIC) is a proposed consortium between Northern Kentucky University, University of Kentucky, University of Louisville and Purdue University. Each university would provide technical assistance in the areas of their expertise. CPIC would be available for new entrepreneurs, start-up companies, and existing companies to use 24 hours a day. In addition to reaching a wider audience this virtual center would reduce overhead costs for the universities. From conception CIPC would offer a number of modules to assist new businesses, with additional modules and features added in the future. Another innovative aspect of CPIC is that it involves students from participating universities to work with faculty experts assigned to each module. Students, especially those majored in entrepreneurial fields will gain valuable practical experience in this process. In this article, we present the development of this unique virtual center in details.

Mark Rajai|Modifications of Engineering Management Program at California State Uni-versity Northridge|Alireza Kabirian, S Jimmy Gandhi||age|23||1||This paper discusses the structure, requirements, and teaching methods of a new Online Master of Science degree in Engineering Management (EMOL) to be offered through Tseng College, an extended learning wing of California State University-Northridge (CSUN). This new program is significantly different from the residential program currently offered by Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Management (MSEM) department of CSUN in a number of aspects. To come up with our ideas for restructuring the Engineering Management (EM) program, we first conducted a benchmarking effort, by reviewing various EM programs. In this paper, the authors have summarized the results of their research about similar programs offered in leading US schools. The authors are in the processes of implementing two categories of changes: first restructuring program requirements and then modernizing the teaching and delivery methods. These two together should modernize the statuesque to bring it to the state of the art education of EM. 
Mark Rajai|Conquering the hurdles of the tenure and promotion process for Junior Faculty Members|Keith V Johnson, Mark Rajai||age|6||1||The process of tenure and promotion can be a harrowing experience for faculty in higher education. A tenured faculty member is one whose job, with a few exceptions, is secured for life. These exceptions typically include the closure of the department,(although a good faith effort may be made to place them in a related department within the university), gross negligence, and sexual harassment. Tenure was designed to protect faculty from the volatile behavior and attitudes of administrators. The process generally occurs in the sixth year of employment and for many can be stressful. A candidate for tenure and promotion is evaluated in the areas of teaching, scholarship and service. This manuscript addresses tactics, strategies and approaches that were utilized by the author to overcome the tenure and promotion process.

The results of a survey and the role of Concurrent Engineering and latest technological innovations in enhancing US competitiveness in the world market are also presented. 
Mark Rajai|Development of an Integrated System for Design Evaluation|Mark R Rajai, Keith V Johnson, Robert Matthews||age|5||1||In this paper, two software packages (AutoCAD and Mannequin) are integrated to create an ergonomic CAD system. This developed system will provide designers with a powerful graphical tool to evaluate their design for human factors and safety criteria. An absence of a truly integrated ergonomic CAD system that has been desired by many researchers and designers was the motivating factor behind our efforts. Steps taken to integrate these two somewhat incompatible software is explained in this paper. Now designers have an ergonomic CAD system to assist them to design products according to physical abilities and characteristics of their human operators. Utilizing this type of technology could revolutionize the way products are designed and significantly reduce the alarming number of related injuries, thus saving millions of dollars. This integrated system could also substantially reduce the critical factor of time to market and lower overall cost of designing new products by allowing designers to test their products for human fit without having to build a prototype or using real subject.

Mark Rajai|LabView-Based Navigational Aids to Predict the Position of Automated Guided Vehicles with Ultrasound and Radio Frequency Sensing|Ravindra Thamma, Gregory Marshall, Hugo Cuervo Garcia, Mark Rajai|||||||This research develops a graphical LabVIEW virtual instrument (VI) ultrasonic distance measurement system based on time-of-flight theory to estimate AGV triangulation position. The distance measurement unit, or sub VI, communicates directly with the microcontrollers that contain ultrasound transmitters and RF receivers. The signal from the ultrasound receiver is processed via a custom-built circuit on the mobile unit. The sub VI generates a pulse of 40 KHz via a NI-6602 32-bit counter timer card. As the pulse is received and processed on the mobile unit, it then transmits an RF signal back to the RF receiver on the base unit. The counter timer card will repeat the signal to the sub VI to begin the distance calculation once the RF receiver captures a signal from the mobile unit. 
Mark Rajai|Guardian 2000: An Inter-University Team Collaboration to Design & Market A New Product|Mark Rajai, Mel Mendelson|||||||In the real world, global out-sourcing is causing industrial products to be developed in virtual teams to reduce costs and development times 1. These needs have created the opportunity for this proposed project. Here product teams must design, manufacture, and market new products where the team members are not co-located in the same place at the same time 2. It is important to introduce this into the classroom, because virtual interactions are becoming increasingly important as separated teams jointly develop and market products.

Maryam Tabibzadeh|Applying the AcciMap methodology to investigate the tragic Sewol Ferry accident in South Korea|Samuel Lee, Young Bo Moh, Maryam Tabibzadeh, Najmedin Meshkati|2017/3/1|Applied ergonomics|59||517-525|Elsevier|This study applies the AcciMap methodology, which was originally proposed by Professor Jens Rasmussen (1997), to the analysis of the tragic Sewol Ferry accident in South Korea on April 16, 2014, which killed 304 mostly young people and is considered as a national disaster in that country. This graphical representation, by incorporating associated socio-technical factors into an integrated framework, provides a big-picture to illustrate the context in which an accident occurred as well as the interactions between different levels of the studied system that resulted in that event. In general, analysis of past accidents within the stated framework can define the patterns of hazards within an industrial sector. Such analysis can lead to the definition of preconditions for safe operations, which is a main focus of proactive risk management systems. In the case of the Sewol Ferry accident, a lot of the blame has been placed on … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|Learning from the BP Deepwater Horizon accident: risk analysis of human and organizational factors in negative pressure test|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Najmedin Meshkati|2014/6/1|Environment Systems and Decisions|34|2|194-207|Springer US|According to several seminal investigation reports on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) accident, misinterpretation of a critical test, called negative pressure test (NPT), was a major contributing cause of that disaster. NPT, according to many credible references, is the primary step to ascertain well integrity during any offshore drilling. This paper introduces a three-layer, conceptual risk analysis framework to assess the critical role of human and organizational factors in conducting and interpreting a negative pressure test. This framework has been developed by generalizing the risk assessment model that was proposed by the authors for the analysis of the conducted NPT by the DWH crew. In addition, the application of the introduced framework in this study is not limited to NPT misinterpretation. In fact, it can be generalized and be potentially useful for the risk analysis of future oil and gas drilling as well as … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|A risk analysis methodology to address human and organizational factors in offshore drilling safety: With an emphasis on negative pressure test|Maryam Tabibzadeh|2014||||||According to the final Presidential National Commission report on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, there is need to" integrate more sophisticated risk assessment and risk management practices" in the oil industry. Reviewing the literature of the offshore drilling industry indicates that most of the developed risk analysis methodologies do not fully and more importantly, systematically address the contribution of Human and Organizational Factors (HOFs) in accident causation. This is while results of a comprehensive study, from 1988 to 2005, of more than 600 well-documented major failures in offshore structures show that approximately 80% of those failures were due to HOFs. In addition, lack of safety culture, as an issue related to HOFs, have been identified as a common contributing cause of many accidents in this industry.

These events, such as nuclear accidents, pose serious threats and long-lasting health and environmental consequences to workers, the local public, and possibly the whole country and neighboring regions. Such failures, given interconnectivities and interdependencies, could also have spillover effects and threaten the integrity of other systems operating in the same area. There is an essential need for effective integration and interoperability among multiple emergency response agencies, possibly from different countries, in the case of an accident in a safety-sensitive industry that causes the release of hazardous materials or contaminants. This article proposes a generic integrated system-oriented model to address this urgent need. It has been applied to the Persian Gulf area and its waters …

Despite this critical role, the importance of safety and safety culture in the natural gas industry has not been adequately highlighted. The absence of strict regulations and lack of attention towards precautionary measures have allowed the industry to persevere with insufficient urgency for implementing innovative technologies and safety-first protocols. On October 23, 2015, the Aliso Canyon natural gas accident highlighted how the lack of regulatory oversight in a low probability, high consequence industry could have such impactful and unpredictable repercussions. This paper analyzes the concatenation of events that led to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. It adopts the AcciMap methodology, which was originally introduced by Rasmussen in 1997 as an accident investigation framework, to … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|A proactive risk assessment framework to enhance patient safety in operating rooms|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Gelareh Jahangiri|2017/7/17||||263-274|Springer, Cham|Patient safety, as a main aspect of quality of care, has been a major issue over the last decades in the healthcare industry. The number of preventable medical errors in hospitals has been noticeably high. These errors are more likely to occur in intensive care units including Operating Rooms (ORs). Moreover, preventable errors such as operating on a wrong body part have serious consequences. This paper fills an important gap by proposing a framework for proactive risk assessment of operations in ORs through the identification and monitoring of appropriate Leading Safety Indicators (LSIs) to evaluate the safety of operations and generate warning/predicting signals for potential failures. These LSIs are identified across the six layers of the Rasmussen’s Risk Management Framework, which each represents a main group of involved decision-makers. These layers in our context, from top to bottom, are … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|Safety culture in oil and gas operations: A risk analysis framework to address communication and interoperation of multiple interacting organizations|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Najmedin Meshkati|2015/3/16|||||Society of Petroleum Engineers|According to a most recent (June 2014) report by the US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) that investigated the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, inadequate management systems and poor safety culture were major underlying causes of that blowout. This analysis has been corroborated by many other seminal reports on the DWH accident. In fact, lack of safety culture has been identified as a common contributing cause of many accidents in the oil and gas industry. In response to the above serious fact, there are strong recommendations that the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) of the US Department of the Interior, as the responsible regulatory agency for offshore operations in the Outer Continental Shelf, has to promote safety culture. In addition, the BSEE director, in his speech for the fourth anniversary of the DWH accident in April 2014, emphasized the importance of fostering a culture of … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|A proposed'standard'framework for conducting negative pressure test|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Najmedin Meshkati|2016|International Journal of Oil, Gas and Coal Technology|12|3|248-264|Inderscience Publishers (IEL)|According to the 2011 Chief Counsel's report of the Presidential National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, negative pressure test (NPT) is the primary way of evaluating the integrity of cementing and other flow barriers at the bottom of a well. Yet, despite the criticality of this test, no detailed, standard framework for conducting NPT exists or is practiced in the oil and gas drilling industry. This paper presents a new set of standards for conducting negative pressure tests in order to improve the safety of drilling operations. The developed framework in this paper sets guidelines on proper implementation and monitoring of NPT. This framework is an attempt to systematically address and analyse results of such test. In addition, a case study is presented to examine the deficiencies associated with conducting a negative pressure test in a real drilling case in the Gulf of Mexico. [Received: June 6 …

This paper proposes a risk assessment framework by integrating the 10 traits of a positive safety culture, initially introduced by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with an accident investigation framework called AcciMap, originally proposed by Rasmussen, to proactively address and analyze risks of failures and accidents in the railroad industry. In the first phase, the AcciMap framework is developed to analyze different involved socio-technical and human factors that contributed to the 2008 Chatsworth train collision. The AcciMap, like other accident investigation frameworks, however provides retrospective analyses. Therefore, in the next phase, the 10 traits of a positive safety culture … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|Reducing Medication Errors and Increasing Patient Safety: Utilizing the Fault Tree Analysis|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Anjana Muralidharan|2018/7/21||||207-218|Springer, Cham|According to the 2000 Institute of Medicine Report on Building a Safer Health System, experts estimated that 8000 Americans die every year from preventable medication errors. It is believed that these errors annually affect more than 7 million patients with the cost of approximately $21 billion across all care settings. Despite some developed studies on analyzing the contributing causes of medication errors, there is a need for the development of more robust, systematic methodologies to identify their root causes and provide preventive measures to avoid their recurrence.

Maryam Tabibzadeh|A Signal Detection Model to Interpret Safety Tests in Offshore Oil Drilling|M Tabibzadeh, D von Winterfeldt, N Meshkati|2018|Proceedings of 2018 Probability Safety Assessment and Management Conference. Los Angeles, CA, September|||16-21||According to the findings of the US District Court on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) case,“the misinterpretation of the negative pressure test was a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, fire, and oil spill.” It is noteworthy that the Negative Pressure Test (NPT) was not only specific to the Macondo well operations; rather it is a critical procedure to ascertain well integrity in offshore drilling in general. Therefore, the correct interpretation of this test and designing optimal responses is crucial for the safety of future offshore drilling. This paper uses signal detection theory and proposes a model to provide responses to warning signals in offshore drilling and, in particular, to optimally respond to the findings of NPTs. The structure and generic parametric equations of this model enable oil and gas practitioners to calculate a cut-off point value, as a threshold to accept or reject an implemented NPT, which is crucial in the …

Maryam Tabibzadeh|SPE-173508-MS|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Najmedin Meshkati|2015/3||||||According to a most recent (June 2014) report by the US Chemical Safety Board (CSB) that investigated the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, inadequate management systems and poor safety culture were major underlying causes of that blowout. This analysis has been corroborated by many other seminal reports on the DWH accident. In fact, lack of safety culture has been identified as a common contributing cause of many accidents in the oil and gas industry. In response to the above serious fact, there are strong recommendations that the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) of the US Department of the Interior, as the responsible regulatory agency for offshore operations in the Outer Continental Shelf, has to promote safety culture. In addition, the BSEE director, in his speech for the fourth anniversary of the DWH accident in April 2014, emphasized the importance of fostering a culture of safety among all involved in offshore operations so that it becomes part of the way business is conducted.

However, with spot welding (1) structural performance of the joint may be degraded through heat-affected zones created by the high temperature thermal joining process, (2) achieving the double-sided access necessary for the spot welding electrodes may limit design flexibility, and (3) variability with welds leads to production inconsistencies. Selfpiercing rivets have been used before; however they require different rivet/die combinations depending on the material being joined, which adds to process complexity. In recent years the introductions of screw products that combine the technologies of friction drilling and thread forming have entered the market. These types of screw products do not have these access limitations as through-part connections are formed by one-sided access using a … 
Durul Ulutan|Stochastic tool wear assessment in milling difficult to machine alloys|Farbod Akhavan Niaki, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|2015|International Journal of Mechatronics and Manufacturing Systems|8|3-4|134-159|Inderscience Publishers (IEL)|In the machining industry, maximising profit is intuitively a primary goal; therefore continuously increasing machining process uptime and consequently productivity and efficiency is crucial. Tool wear plays an important factor in both machining uptime and quality, and since tool failure is related to the surface quality and the dimensional accuracy of the end product, it is essential to quantify and predict this phenomenon with the best possible certainty. One of the most common ways of tool wear prediction is through the use of low cost spindle current sensing technology which is used to measure spindle power consumption in CNC machines and relate power increase to tool wear. In this work, two methods of stochastic filtering (ie Kalman and particle filter) were used in predicting tool flank wear in machining difficult-to-machine materials through spindle power consumption measurements. Results show a maximum of 15% average error in estimation, which indicates the good potential of using stochastic filtering techniques in estimating tool flank wear. In addition, the particle filter was used for online estimation of a spindle power model parameter with uniform and Gaussian mixture models as the initial probability density functions, and the evolution of this parameter to the true posterior density function over time was investigated.

Modeling the residual stress profile is currently tedious and inaccurate. This study introduces a new method of understanding the residual stress profile in terms of quantifiable key measures: peak tensile stress at the surface, magnitude and depth of peak compressive stress, and depth at which residual stress becomes near-zero. Experiments in turning IN-100 and milling GTD-111 have been conducted and subsequent X-ray Diffraction measurements have been utilized to obtain residual stress profiles. Using a sinusoidal decay function fitted to measured residual stress profiles, these four key profile measures are extracted and then the effects of process parameters such as cutting speed, feed, cutting edge radius, and tool coating on these measures are investigated.

This feature makes these alloys a suitable candidate for power generation industry. However, high wear rate and tooling cost are known as the challenges in machining Ni-based alloys. The high wear rate causes a rapid failure of the tool, and therefore, fewer data will be available for model development. In addition, variations in material properties and hardness, residual stress, tool runout, and tolerances are some uncontrollable effects adding uncertainties to the currently developed models. To address these challenges, a probabilistic Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been used in this work. The MCMC method is a powerful tool for parameter inference and quantification of embedded uncertainties of models. It is shown that by adding a prior probability to the observation …

This study presents a new FE simulation-based methodology to determine the modified constitutive model parameters utilizing the force results from face turning experiments conducted for both Ti-6Al-4V and IN-100. In these simulations, material constitutive models have a great influence on the results and must be selected carefully to represent the correct material flow stress characteristics. Conventional modified constitutive material models with flow softening behavior are utilized and further modified to represent the thermal softening effect on the flow softening behavior, where the temperatures can be much higher than normal for machining these materials. Parameters of the temperaturedependent flow softening based material constitutive model for both materials have been determined by using an inverse methodology. Comparison of measured and simulated forces with the modified material models has shown close agreements.

They play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength, high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. Machinability suffers as a result of these properties and harsh machining conditions occur, resulting in high cutting forces and tool wear. To combat the difficulties in the machining of nickel-based superalloys, such as poor thermal diffusivity and high levels of abrasive wear, trochoidal milling was introduced as an alternative method of milling. This method of milling combines linear motion with uniform circular motion, reducing chip load in exchange for increased machining time. Industry is averse to its widespread adoption due to increasing cycle times when compared to conventional milling methods …

Syst|9|2|97-121||In this work, wavelet packet decomposition along with principle component analysis are utilised for feature extraction using two low cost sensing methods: vibration and power sensors, in end-milling of gamma prime-strengthened alloy. The high wear rate of this material induces a rapid transition from a sharp state to a dull state of the tool, and hence limits the number of available data for model establishment. To address this challenge, a neural network with Bayesian regularisation is designed and its performance is compared with regression and time-series models. A maximum of 4% estimation error for Bayesian regularisation neural network, compared to 33% and 17% estimation error of the latter models, shows the good potential of this technique when a limited dataset is available. In addition, the use of low cost measuring sensors in this paper aligned well with the industrial applications to detect and avoid unscheduled downtime in machining situations.

Turning of Ti-6Al~ 4V using inserts with uncoated, TiAlN coated, and TiAlN+ cBN coated single and multi~ layer coated tungsten carbide inserts is conducted, forces and tool wear are measured. 3-D ﬁnite element simulations are utilized to predict chip formation, forces, temperatures and tool wear on these inserts. Predicted forces and tool wear contours are compared with experiments. The temperature distributions and tool wear contours demonstrate some advantages of coated insert designs. 
Durul Ulutan|Prediction of tool wear based on cutting forces when end milling titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V|Cynthia Stanley, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|2014/6/9||||V001T04A040-V001T04A040|American Society of Mechanical Engineers|Research regarding tool wear in the machining of difficult materials is important because it is a significant indicator of process failure in terms of degradation of part quality, and the resulting high cost and increased process time. Prior researchers have investigated the effects of cutting parameters on tool wear and as a result, tool life has seen significant improvement. However, these studies are not concerned with tool flank wear during machining; they instead focus on tool flank wear after a certain amount of cutting distance. This study proposes a new method of predicting tool flank wear during machining that has the capability of suggesting tool failure without directly measuring the tool. For this purpose, a detailed set of experiments on end milling of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V was conducted and analyzed. Then, the resultant force output, which can be monitored during machining, was used to establish a predictive …

Micro-milling is an effective process for direct fabrication of titanium components. This paper presents some experimental investigations on micromilling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with uncoated and cBN coated micro-end mills. Micro-milling of straight channels are conducted and surface roughness, burr formation and tool wear are measured. A performance comparison of the micro-end mills is also provided. An experimental design is utilized to analyze the influence of process parameters on the quality of fabricated channels. Multi-criteria optimization studies are also conducted to identify the process parameters which minimize the surface roughness and burr formation concurrently. 
Durul Ulutan|Energy consumption modeling and analyses in automotive manufacturing final assembly process|Lujia Feng, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|2015/7/30||||224-228|IEEE|As an important part of a sustainability strategy, energy usage in an automotive manufacturing plant is an important topic that has recently gained significant attention. Researchers mostly focus on energy conservation through increasing the efficiency of such facilities, optimizing energy supplies, and scheduling efficient production sequences. However, attention is seldom focused on holistic energy modeling at the level of process assembly lines. In this study, the problem of energy consumption during the automotive vehicle final assembly (FA) process is discussed. An energy classification in the final assembly department is generated to give more transparent understanding of the energy consumption in each category. Typical energy models of every energy category are presented to demonstrate the potential energy savings through a combined approach. Finally, considering the current status of most … 
Durul Ulutan|Predictive modeling and multi-objective optimization of maching-induced residual stresses: investigation of machining parameter effects|Durul Ulutan|2013||||||Description In the aerospace industry, titanium and nickel-based alloys are frequently used for critical structural components, especially due to their higher strength at both low and high temperatures, and higher wear and chemical degradation resistance. However, because of their unfavorable thermal properties, deformation and friction-induced microstructural changes prevent the end products from having good surface integrity properties. In addition to surface roughness, microhardness changes, and microstructural alterations, the machining-induced residual stress profiles of titanium and nickel-based alloys contribute in the surface integrity of these products. Therefore, it is essential to create a comprehensive method that predicts the residual stress outcomes of machining processes, and understand how machining parameters (cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, depth of cut, etc.) or tool parameters (tool rake …

An introduction to lightweight materials couples that of lightweight joining with a thermo-mechanical process, Flow Drill Screwdriving (FDS). This process is favored in terms of robustness, short installation time, and only requiring access to one side. The most significant challenge of this process is reducing the material sheet separation to minimize any possibility of corrosion buildup. Warm forming of aluminum has been shown to increase ductility and formability of the material and thus the process benefits from a reduced cycle time that leads to cost reduction. In this study, the effect of an auxiliary heat source on the flow of Al6063 is investigated for the FDS application. In order to accomplish this task, a …

For reliable results, CBM systems need early and reliable warning based on prediction models that use multiple types of sensors. In this study, tool flank wear during end milling difficult-to-machine alloys was measured using an optical microscope. Then, vibration data collected with an accelerometer was investigated for its relationship to tool flank wear. The developed relationship between accelerometer output and tool flank wear was validated with further experiments. It was observed from frequency domain responses of these outputs that specific harmonics of the tool pass frequency were dominant, and tool flank wear can be related to the amplitude of these harmonics during machining. This way, it was shown that through accurate online prediction of tool wear, premature interruption of the process …

However, these superior properties as well as its low thermal conductivity and chemical reactivity make it a challenge to machine Ti-6Al-4V at optimal conditions. In order to overcome this challenge, researchers constantly develop new tools and new techniques, but the extent of machining rates that can be used efficiently with those tools and techniques are usually not clear. Considering only one variable in the process and optimizing according to that variable is not sufficient because of the interactions between parameters. Also, selecting one objective function from a pool of many is not beneficial since those objectives …

Durul Ulutan|Prediction of Machining Induced Microhardness using Finite Element Simulations and Machine Learning in Titanium Alloys|YM Arisoy, D Ulutan, T Özel|||||||Titanium and its alloys are today used in many industries including aerospace, automotive and medical device. Ti-6Al-4V alloy is the most suitable because it offers favorable mechanical characteristics such as high strength-to-weight ratio, toughness, superb corrosion resistance and bio-compatibility. Titanium alloys are difficult-tomachine materials with considerable manufacturing problems such as machining induced surface integrity. In this study, the feasibility of predicting machining induced microhardness profiles by using finite element simulations and temperature-based machine learning predictive modeling has been investigated. 3D turning experiments are utilized to validate the FE simulation predictions. Predicted microhardness profiles are then utilized in understanding the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, tool material, coating and edge radius on the surface integrity. The study provides essential understanding in predicting machining induced microstructure alterations that are detrimental to fatigue life of titanium alloyed end products.

Serrated and cyclical chip formation has been simulated for using tools in the presence of tool flank wear. The predicted residual stresses and surface integrity is compared against with experimental results from literature. These results are highly essential in predicting machining induced microstructure alterations that are detrimental to fatigue life of nickel and titanium alloy components. 
Larry Allen|Seasonal abundance, composition and productivity of the littoral fish assemblage in upper Newport Bay, California|Larry Glenn Allen|1982/1/1|||||Fishery Bulletin|This study was designed to characterize the littoral fish populations by 1) composition and principal species, 2) diversity and seasonal dynamics, 3) productivity, and 4) important environmental factors. Monthly samples (January 1978 to January 1979) obtained with four quantitative sampling methods at three stations in upper Newport Bay yielded 55,561 fishes from 32 species which weighed 103.5 kg. The top five species made up over 98% of the total number of individuals. One species, Atherinops affinis, predominated in numbers (76.7% of all fishes) and biomass (79.8%).

We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock …

Clustering based on the presence or absence of species in bays, or at intervals of latitude in California (32-42⚬ N), was used to produce dendrogams of 224 bay-occurring species, of 280 non bay-occurring species and of approximately 500 species in toto; these in turn served to identify three distributional regions in California waters: (1) southern (32-33⚬ N); (2) central (approximately 34-36⚬ N); and (3) northern (approximately 37-42⚬ N). Mean latitudinal dissimilarity was greatest (53%) for the bay dendrogram and least (10%) for the non-bay dendrogram.

Global populations of Galeorhinus galeus are in decline due to the exploitation of the fishery over the past 80 years. Currently, the genetic structure of eastern Pacific populations of G. galeus is not known and recent observations in the northeastern Pacific suggest an increase in numbers. To evaluate gene flow among populations of G. galeus, 116 samples were collected and analysed from six geographically dispersed locations: Australia, North America, South Africa, South America (Argentina and Peru), and the UK. Analysis of 968 to 1006 bp of the 1068‐bp mitochondrial control region revealed 38 unique haplotypes that were largely restricted to their collecting locality. Significant genetic structure was detected among populations (ΦST = 0.84; P < 0.000001) and migration estimates were …

YOY halibut were most abundant in fully-protected waters; semi-protected waters contained one-half to one-quarter the number of YOY halibut. No YOY halibut were collected at the exposed coast site. Newly recruited halibut ranged from 8 to 12 mm SL and were approximately 20 to 29 days old. Gammarid amphipods, mysids, teleosts, and harpacticoid copepods were the major food items of YOY halibut. Recruitment was significantly greater in 1983 and 1984 than in 1985 (catch-per-unit-effort in 1983> 1984> 1985). 
Larry Allen|The decline and recovery of four predatory fishes from the Southern California Bight|Daniel J Pondella, Larry G Allen|2008/4/1|Marine Biology|154|2|307-313|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|What to do about fisheries collapse and the decline of large fishes in marine ecosystems is a critical debate on a global scale. To address one aspect of this debate, a major fisheries management action, the removal of gill nets in 1994 from the nearshore arena in the Southern California Bight (34°26′30″N, 120°27′09″W to 33°32′03″N, 117°07′28″W) was analyzed. First, the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass (Atractoscion nobilis; Sciaenidae) in the early 1980s. From 1982 to 1997 catch remained at a historically low level (47.8 ± 3.0 mt) when compared to landings from 1936–1981, but increased significantly from 1995–2004 (r = 0.89, P < 0.01) to within the 95% confidence limit of the historic California landings. After the white seabass fishery crashed in the early 1980s, landings of soupfin (Galeorhinus galeus; Triakidae) and leopard shark (Triakis …

OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS|Spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasriatus) are under increasing angling pressure in the shallow waters off southern California. In southern California, spotted sand bass are largely restricted to shallow, warm-water areas such as bays, estuaries, and harbors, which appear to serve as warm-water refuges for this basically subtropical species. Rod-and-reel sampling from June 1991 to August 1993 yielded 639 individuals from seven locations. Specimens ranged from 51 to 400 mm SL, with only 8 fish below 150 mm SL and 10 above 330 mm SL. Analysis of otolith sections revealed that a single opaque zone was laid down each summer. The oldest fish was 14 years old; the vast majority of the large specimens were 6 to 10 years old. Growth rate was sharply asymptotic, with some fish reaching 200 mm SL in their first year. Because growth rates varied significantly among the four locations tested, the overall …

Larry Allen|Bays and Estuaries|LARRY G Allen, MARY M Yoklavich, GREGOR M Cailliet, MICHAEL H Horn|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||119-148|University of California Press|Few habitats offer a more challenging environment to marine ﬁshes than bays and estuaries. These interfaces between land and sea at river mouths present highly variable physical and chemical conditions for marine ﬁshes most of which usually have narrow tolerances to these environmental gradations. Virtually all of the prominent physical and chemical characteristics of water, such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, change dramatically over space and time in these relatively shallow habitats. Tidal exchange, especially over the sometimes extensive mudﬂats and salt marshes, creates additional variability associated with strong currents, possible aerial exposure, and isolation in pools. Despite these dramatic environmental ﬂuctuations, bays and estuaries throughout the world are recognized as important ﬁsh habitats, serving especially as spawning and nursery sites, migration routes, and areas naturally supporting large populations of certain coastal ﬁsh species (eg, McHugh, 1967; Haedrich, 1983; Elliott, 2002). The complex and dynamic qualities of estuaries have fostered continuing discussion in the literature as to their deﬁnition and classiﬁcation and to their role as nursery grounds. Elliott and McLusky (2002) point out that the basic challenge of deﬁning and classifying estuaries stems from their prominence as habitats that represent spatial and temporal continua, for example, in the environmental variable of salinity and the biological variable of community structure. These authors argue for an “expert judgment checklist” that involves assessment of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics to help deﬁne, delimit, and … 
Larry Allen|Structure and standing stock of the fish assemblages of San Diego Bay, California from 1994 to 1999|Larry G Allen, Amy M Findlay, Carol M Phalen|2002/8/1|Bulletin-Southern California Academy of Sciences|101|2|49-85|Southern California Academy of Sciences|Twenty quarterly samples were taken of the fish assemblages of San Diego Bay from July 1994 to April 1999. Each quarter, four stations were occupied using a variety of sampling methods (large seine, small seines, square enclosure, purse seine, beam trawl, and otter trawl) designed to assess all components of the ichthyofauna. These samples yielded a total of 497,344 fishes belonging to 78 species and weighing 2,775 kg over the five-year period. Northern anchovy was the most abundant fish species comprising 43% of the total catch despite its virtual absence in 1997-98, followed by topsmelt, the slough anchovy and Pacific sardine. Round stingrays dominated in weight constituting almost 25% of the total biomass taken followed by spotted sand bass, and northern anchovy. Both numerical abundance and biomass were highest in the spring and summer months due largely to heavy recruitment of juvenile surfperches, topsmelt and northern anchovies. Large catches of northern anchovies, Pacific sardines, round stingrays, and spotted sand bass also contributed to the pronounced peaks in most July samples. Approximately 70% of all individual fish captured in San Diego Bay during this study were juveniles. The 40 most common species/recruits clustered into eleven, resident and seasonal groups. According to canonical correlation analysis, distance from the mouth of the bay, depth, temperature, and salinity accounted for nearly 88%(R2= 0.875) of the variance in species abundances. In general, the fish assemblages of San Diego Bay were found to be diverse, abundant, highly seasonal, and highly productive. The bay serves as a …

Larry Allen|Temporal patterns of settlement in the temperate reef fish Paralabrax clathratus|Amy M Findlay, Larry G Allen|2002/8/8|Marine Ecology Progress Series|238||237-248||Variation in settlement of kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, from the pelagic to benthic environment was monitored daily during the summer 1998 on the leeward side of Santa Catalina Island, California. Settlement collectors were placed underwater on buoy lines at 5 to 7 m depth to provide a standardized form of spatial and structural refuge for settling larvae. SCUBA divers retrieved and replaced collectors each day for 58 d and totaled the number of kelp bass settlers found. Settlement of kelp bass occurred nonrandomly around the lunar cycle, suggesting a semi-lunar pattern of settlement just after the new and full moons, with peak settlement occurring approximately 5 d after the full moon. A high, positive correlation was found between settlement and tidal amplitude, and between settlement and onshore winds. A high negative correlation was found between settlement and sea surface temperature. This indicates a strong relationship between settlement of kelp bass and high amplitude tides, drops in sea surface temperature and strong onshore winds. These results suggest that internal tidal bores were a likely means of onshore transport, because bores produce near-bottom onshore flow and are prevalent during high amplitude or spring tides, but especially, they coincide with abrupt drops in sea surface temperature. Back-calculated spawn dates of successful settlers suggested a semi-lunar pattern of spawning just after the new and full moons, with peak activity occurring near the full moon. Kelp bass that settled at spring tides were significantly younger and smaller than kelp bass that settled at neap tides, thus suggesting that settlement of … 
Larry Allen|Abundance, diversity, and seasonality of cryptic fishes and their contribution to a temperate reef fish assemblage off Santa Catalina Island, California|Larry G Allen, Lucienne S Bouvier, Robert E Jensen|1992|Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences|91|2|55-69||The populations of cryptic fishes in a rock-cobble shoreline habitat within Big Fisherman's Cove, Santa Catalina Island were assessed in relation to the local conspicuous fish populations. Sampling was conducted bimonthly over a one-year period from October 1984 to October 1985. Five random, I m2 samples were taken from each of three depth strata (2.3-3.0 m, 4.2-5.1 m, and 6.4-7.6 m). Lythrypnus dalli was the most abundant fish (37% of total catch), followed by Paraclinus integripinnis (19%), Gibbonsia elegans (14%), Alloclinus holderi (12%), and Lythrypnus zebra (9%). The assemblage was markedly seasonal in terms of numerical and biomass densities with each being generally higher in warmer months. L. dalli were significantly more abundant in the deeper stratum while the density of Paraclinus integripinnis was greatest in shallower water. The numerical density of cryptic fishes was, on average, four-times that of the conspicuous fishes as measured by diver transects (283/1 00 m2 versus 71.5/100 m2). Inclusion of cryptic with conspicuous fishes increased the Shannon-Weiner Diversity (H') by an average of 41%(1.49 to 2.11) and increased the number of species by 50%(14 to 28 species). Cryptic fishes appear to make a substantial contribution to the abundance and diversity of fish assemblages inhabiting rock reef environments in southern California. The accurate censusing of reef fish populations has long been a problem for fish ecologists. Reef fishes are particularly difficult to sample because the assemblages consist of two main groups with radically different lifestyles. The first group, referred to as conspicuous fishes are generally … 
Larry Allen|Feeding mechanisms and trophic interactions|Michael H Horn, Lara A Ferry-Graham|2006/2/15|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||660|University of California Press|The composition of the present-day California marine ﬁsh fauna is largely a reﬂection of trophic interactions, as stated by Hobson (see chapter 2). The diversity and complexity of the fauna are at least in part a response to these interactions over evolutionary time scales. As such, many of the feeding behaviors and associated morphologies of ﬁshes in California waters have been shaped and honed in response to selective pressures specifically related to feeding performance. Whatever paths of evolution have resulted in this rich and varied ﬁsh fauna, the array of extant species represents much of the amazing dietary diversity seen among ocean-dwelling species in general. Fishes encounter prey that varies enormously in degree of mobility, habitat location, and in size, structure, digestibility, and nutritional content. Not surprisingly, ﬁshes including those living in the sea off California are generally opportunistic and exhibit a wide variety of ways to capture and process food to meet their energy and nutritional requirements. In this chapter, we ﬁrst organize the subject of food and feeding in ﬁshes into three parts and variously draw our examples from members of the California marine ﬁsh fauna. In the ﬁrst part, we discuss factors that determine diet including body shape and feeding behavior, identify types of food capture, and describe several kinds of feeding mechanisms.

Eggs, larvae, and juvenile-adult fishes were sampled monthly over a one-year period (February 1979-January 1980) in the Cabrillo Beach area, a relatively little altered section of Los Angeles Harbor. Engraulis mordax was the most abundant species of juvenile-adult fish while sciaenid eggs and E. mordax larvae dominated the ichthyoplankton samples. Both the juvenileadult and egg and larval populations showed marked seasonal fluctuations in abundance. Quantitative clustering of juvenile-adult species in each sample produced five distinct groups ofresident and periodic species. Temperature and depth (ofcapture) accounteq for 76% of the variation in juvenile-adult abundances based on two canonical correlation axes. The Cabrillo Beach area contains a variety of habitats and supports a seasonally dynamic fish fauna characterized by a high proportion of juveniles.

The basic diel pattern found was of greater total numbers, total biomass, and species richness at night. Larger catches were made at night for 12 (numbers) and 9 (biomass) of the 20 most abundant species (total trawls). Average weight per fish (all species) and the length-frequency distributions of five of seven species, however, did not differ meaningfully between day and night samples.

Larry Allen|Ecology of fishes in upper Newport Bay, California: seasonal dynamics and community structure|Michael H Horn, Larry G Allen|1981|||45||California Department of Fish and Game|A total of 366 bimonthly (January 1978-January 1979) samples taken with six types of gear (otter trawl, gill net, bag seine, small seine, drop net, square enclosure - all with replication except the gill net) at four stations in upper Newport Bay, California yielded 51,816 fishes belonging to 46 species and weighing over 353 kg. Atherinops affinis (topsmelt) was the most abundant species accounting for 76% of total individuals. Seven species, all of low trophic levels, made up over 97% of the total catch. Mugil cephalus (striped mullet) ranked first in biomass (= 36% of the total) with six species accounting for more than 80% of the total biomass. The largest number of individuals (71%) was collected with the bag seine, the greatest number of species (35) was captured with the otter trawl and the largest percentage of the biomass (56%)was obtained with the gill net. Species richness, number of individuals and biomass were lowest in January (1978 or 1979) or March and highest in July (numbers, biomass) or September (species). Bimonthly diversity (H') values ranged from 0.48 to 2.17 (overall value 1.05) and tended to be inversely related to abundance levels. Species richness was greatest at Station 4 (the lowermost station) and least at Station 1 (the uppermost station). Numbers of individuals and biomass peaked at Station 2 and reached lowest levels at Station 1. Length-frequency analysis of six of the most abundant species indicated utilization of the upper bay by two or more stages in the life history of these species. More than 92,000 eggs belonging to seven taxa and an unknown category and 426 larvae from 20 taxa were collected with a 0.5 m … 
Larry Allen|Estimates of age, growth, and settlement from otoliths of young-of-the-year kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus)|Jan F Cordes, Larry G Allen|1997|BULLETIN-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|96||43-60|SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|Settled young-of-the-year (YOY) and older juvenile kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) were collected off the coast of southern California during the summers of 1989 and 1990. Daily rings on the sagittae of settled YOY kelp bass were used to determine age, estimate growth, and construct ring width profiles for each fish. Laboratory-reared larvae revealed that ring deposition began on the third day after hatching, and confirmed the daily periodicity of ring deposition. The combined 1989-90 growth curve could be described as a linear regression with the equation (length (mm))= 14.67+ 1.69 (age (days))(r=. 96), resulting in an average daily growth of 0.59 mm/day for the first 90 days of life. Backcalculated spawn dates suggested a possible lunar periodicity around the full moon. Settlement checks and otolith ring widths were used to determine the time of settlement and explore the possibility of delayed settlement in this species. The average age-at-settlement was calculated to be 30 days, with a range of 25-36 days. Only a single case of delayed settlement was evident from the incrementwidth profiles of 22 fish. The kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus is one of three congeneric species in the family Serranidae found off the coast of southern California. Traditionally a popular sport fish, local southern Californian P. clathratus populations fell off dramatically after heavy post-WWII fishing (Young 1963), but ranked second in the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) catch of 1992 (Oliphant 1993). The kelp bass is generally believed to be a long-lived, slow-growing species, and may reach an age of over thirty years and sizes up to 680 mm (Young … 
Larry Allen|Deep Rock Habitats|M Love, M Yoklavich|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||253-266|University of California Press|In this chapter, we discuss those fishes characteristically found on or over complex seafloor habitats comprising various amounts of cobble, boulders, and rock outcrops in water depths ranging from 30 to 500 m. This depth range encompasses the continental shelf and upper continental slope of California (Greene et al., 1999). We also discuss those fishes associated with such artificial structures as oil platforms off Southern California at similar depths. Because very little is known of fish assemblages associated with deep rock habitats off Baja California, we limit our discussion to California waters. See fig. 10-1 for a general depiction of bathymetry and place names of areas referenced in this chapter. Fishes that associate with complex benthic habitats below scuba depths (ie, greater than 30 m) are difficult and expensive to survey. Historically, fishing nets of various types, particularly trawl nets, have been used to make almost all assessments of deep-water fish communities. However, the rugged nature of many of these habitats renders trawl surveys less effective over low-relief structures, such as cobblestone and boulder fields, and virtually useless to assess fish assemblages accurately over high-relief rock outcrops. In addition, surveys conducted remotely from the sea surface using all types of fishing gear yield little or no information on the association among benthic habitats and fish assemblages.

In this project, 530 specimens of Gulf corvina were collected from commercial gill net fisheries in the Colorado River Delta region in Sonora, Mexico, to characterize population structure, age and growth patterns, age and size at sexual maturity and batch fecundity. Fish ranged from 145 mm to 1013 mm in total length and from 1 to 8 years of age. Von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were: L∞ = 1006 mm, k  =  0.255/yr, t0  =  0.616 years. Growth rates of Gulf corvina did not differ significantly between sexes, although females were predicted to reach a larger asymptotic length. Mean size (Lm50) and age (Am50) at sexual maturity from histological analyses of gonad tissues was 294.7 …

This mitigation effort consisted of the transplantation of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., in the western portion of the bay. In addition to the establishment of a new eelgrass bed, four enhancement reefs made of either quarry rock or concrete rubble were created to further enhance fishery stocks and the area's ecosystem. Two design criteria and a direct comparison between quarry rock and concrete reefs were examined in this 5-yr pilot program. The newly created eelgrass habitat quickly performed at the level of the existing eelgrass bed. The overall analysis found that the mitigation eelgrass habitat was not significantly different from the reference eelgrass habitat in terms of fishes. Neither reef material (quarry rock or concrete rubble) nor original reef design influenced fish utilization … 
Larry Allen|Morphologic and genetic variation among six populations of the spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatofasciatus, from southern California to the upper Sea of Cortez|Gregory J Tranah, Larry G Allen|1999|BULLETIN-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|98||103-118|SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|Spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatoJasciatus, were examined for 19 morphometric and 7 meristic characters to determine the extent of morphologic and genetic variation among six Pacific and Gulf of California populations. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques were used to amplify and cleave the ITS region of the rONA in order to detect differences among these populations. The morphological and genetic lines of evidence demonstrate that significant differentiation has occurred between the most distant Gulf and Pacific regions. The three Baja California populations share significant morphological and genetic affinity and appear to be different from the three Pacific populations. There is no significant morphologic differentiation between the three Pacific populations although genetically they form two different groups. The northernmost Pacific population of San Diego is significantly different from the two southern-Pacific groups as well as the entire gulf sample. The results of this study indicate that geographically isolated populations of nearshore marine fishes, under the influence of strong selection pressures, do not require long periods of time for divergence. The last 15,000 years may have been sufficient to allow significant divergence to occur between upper Gulf and Pacific groups of the spotted sand bass. The spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatoJasciatus, is a serranid native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, having a historical range of San Francisco Bay south to Mazatlan, Mexico. Spotted sand bass rarely occur north of Santa Monica Bay (Love 1991) and are exceedingly …

To provide information critical to the management of this species, settlement patterns of white seabass within the Southern California Bight were investigated for 1988-89. Data were obtained from 16 stations sampled along the southern California coastline during June-October 1988, and at 12 stations sampled along the coasts of the mainland and four Channel Islands May-August 1989. At each station, four 5-minute tows were taken with a 1.6 m beam trawl at each of two depths, 5 and 10 m. Most young-of-the-year white seabass were < 10 mm SL and had settled within 2-3 weeks of capture. Density estimates for white seabass off southern California were low, ranging from 0.3 to only 37.8 individuals per hectare. In 1988, catch-per-unit … 
Larry Allen|The reproductive pattern of barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) from southern California|CHERYL BACA Hovey, Larry G Allen, Timothy E Hovey|2002/12/1|CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORT|||174-181|CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS|Sea basses of the genus Paralabrax are either gonochores or protogynous hermaphrodites. This study sought to determine which, if either, reproductive strategy prevails in barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer). A total of 436 specimens were collected from June 1996 through April 1997 from seven different locations along the southern California coast. Of these, only two (< 0.1%) transitional individuals were found. All males examined exhibited testes with a membrane-lined central cavity and a sperm sinus in the gonadal wall; our findings suggest that these individuals may have passed through a female-like juvenile stage prior to maturation. In addition, 52% of the males examined had atretic bodies. However, males and females were equally distributed throughout the age classes collected. Based on all evidence, we conclude that barred sand bass in southern California are functional gonochores that possess a latent, perhaps ancestral, ability to change sex.

Fish surveys on SCUBA were conducted at two reserve and two non-reserve sites from October 2002 to January 2004. Sites were similar in fish density, species richness and biomass of the entire fish assemblage. However, the adult densities of two important fishery species, California sheep-head (Semicossyphus pulcher; 7.6 ±0.5 and 5.5 ±0.4/100 m2 inside versus outside) and kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus; 3.6 ±0.4 and 2.9 ±0.4 inside versus outside), were significantly higher within the reserve. The reserve appears to be effective in increasing density and biomass of two impacted species that were readily observed and surveyed on SCUBA.

This study examined how the growth rate of juvenile white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, responded to changes in ocean temperature in an El Niño period (1997–1998) in the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, USA. Growth rates of juvenile white seabass during their first 4 years of life were estimated as the slopes of linear relationships between body mass and age (from otoliths) of 800 fish collected at 11 stations throughout the bight.

A stratified random design was used to sample fishes with overnight gill nets, set bimonthly from April-October. Fishes were surveyed on the East and West End of Catalina Island and in Catalina Harbor. Concomitant with this survey, seven coastal sites from Santa Barbara to Newport were surveyed as a comparison. Despite the proximity of the island to the mainland, an analysis of diversity, abundance, richness, and biomass of the nearshore fishes found Catalina Island's ichthyofauna to be functionally different from that of the mainland. This survey technique also found an increase in community importance for elasmobranchs based upon abundance and biomass; our results suggest that other sampling techniques are inadequate for estimating the importance of these large predatory and elusive fishes in nearshore communities.

This specimen presented a unique opportunity to estimate and validate of the potential longevity of the largest nearshore teleost of the northeastern Pacific. A transverse section of the sagittal otolith produced consistent counts of 62 opaque annuli along two different axes of the ventral sulcus region, translating into an estimated birth year of 1948. This age estimate was supported by measurements of radiocarbon (14C) in the other sagittal otolith core (within the first year of growth), relative to Δ14C reference records used for bomb radiocarbon dating. Two otolith core samples produced Δ14C values that were classified as pre-bomb (prior to ∼1958–59), indicating a minimum lifespan of 51 years. It is likely that giant sea bass can live more than 60 …

This expansive area spans the exposed, sandy beaches to the water column above the inner shelf along the entire coastline of California and south into Baja California. The fishes common to this area typically occur over the shallower portions of the shelf (see chapter 7) and the soft bottom surrounding rock reef and kelp bed environments (see chapter 8). The fish assemblages of this area tie all of the shallow water habitats closely together (Allen, 1985). In this chapter, three of the more distinctive fish assemblages within this general area will be discussed:(1) fishes of the surf zone and adjacent drift algal habitat,(2) the coastal pelagic fishes that occupy the water column above the shallow soft bottom and shelf, and (3) fishes of the numerous harbors that have been formed by breakwater construction within this general zone.

Most of the studies to date dealing with composition and temporal changes of bay/estuarine fish populations have been conducted on the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the United States where estuaries are numerous (eg, Bechtel and Copeland* 1970; Dahlberg and Odum* 1970; Derickson and Price* 1973; McErlean, et. aJ., 1973; Oviatt and Nixon, 1973; Reckseik and McCleave, 1973; Haedrich and 
Larry Allen|Surface Waters|Larry G Allen, Jeffrey N Cross|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||320-341|University of California Press|The epipelagic realm technically encompasses the upper 200 m of the ocean beyond the continental shelf, world-wide (Parin, 1968; Helfman et al., 1997). It is easily the largest habitat off California and the home of 40% of the species and 50% of the families of fishes. The water column that overlies the continental shelf comprises what we will call the coastal pelagic (neritic) realm (fig. 12-1). Because the continental shelf off most of California and Baja California is narrow, the fish assemblages of the epipelagic zone and those of the coastal pelagic realm overlap and interact on a seasonal basis (see Chapter 5). In fact, unlike most coastal areas, the highly productive waters of the major upwelling region off California are dominated by coastal pelagic species that spread into the open ocean environment well offshore (up to 300–400 km). The waters below the epipelagic zone include the Mesopelagic (approximately 200–800 m) and the bathypelagic zones (800–1000 m). These deep sea habitats are the main subjects of chapter 13 of this volume. About 200 species (70 families) have been collected in the California Current (Berry and Perkins, 1966), 79 species (30 families) have been collected in the coastal waters (Horn, 1974), and 124 species have been collected in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones (Lavenberg and Ebeling, 1967). Epipelagic fishes are relatively large, active, fast-growing, and long-lived fishes that reproduce early and repeatedly (Childress et al., 1980). Mesopelagic fishes are relatively small, slow-growing, and long-lived fishes that reproduce early and repeatedly. Bathypelagic fishes are relatively large, sluggish, rapid …

Adults were monochromatic for part of the year (calico phase) and sexually dichromatic from April to October, with most adult males adopting bright orange snouts (OS phase). The seasonal occurrence of the OS phase in males overlapped with the spawning season, and the color was limited to ripe males. The OS phase in ripe males may function as a signal of sexual identity and sexual readiness to females. Both males and females exhibited distinct color patterns during courtship and spawning periods. During these periods, males were charcoal colored with dark black bars overlaying white spots (checkered phase), and females were often black with no visible spots (dark phase). Color patterns displayed by adults during spawning activities may …

Together, these and three other species of Seriola comprise an important component of global aquaculture production with an estimated annual value of $1.3 billion. As yellowtail aquaculture grows, the impact of unintentional releases on wild populations has become an increasingly important issue, particularly in light of international trade of hatchery seed. To create a genetic baseline, we examined spatial genetic structure in 260 specimens collected from seven locations over a wide geographical range using 15 nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial control region sequences. Overall genetic differentiation among locations, as revealed by microsatellite data, was highly significant (FST = 0.085, DEST = 0.382, P < 0.001), and pairwise estimates of divergence …

Serranidae) from …|Larry G Allen, Heidi E Block|2012/4|Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences|111|1|15-22|Southern California Academy of Sciences|Accurate estimates of Planktonic Larval Duration (PLD) have become critical to the modeling of larval dispersal and connectivity among ecological communities. Among those species where little information on larval duration is known are the spotted (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) and barred (P. nebulifer) sand basses, two economically important species that have historically been the focus of marine recreational fisheries off southern California. PLD was determined by a count of the daily growth rings from the otolith core to the settlement check and age from the core to the otolith margin. Size at settlement was estimated by the size of the otolith from its core to the settlement mark based on the otolith size to body size relationship. Based on these significant relationships, mean size at settlement of our specimens was calculated to be 10.2 ± 1.6 mmSL for spotted sand bass and 9.1 ± 1.1 mmSL for barred sand bass …

Thirty-five species were observed or collected during the study period. The assemblage of cryptic fishes was composed primarily of a mix of Oregonian and San Diegan, species including snubnose sculpin (Orthonopias triacis), coralline sculpin (Artedius corallinus) and blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii). The species composition of conspicuous fishes was approximately equal between taxa from these two provinces. Blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) and kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) dominated the assemblage of conspicuous fishes. Species composition reflects the localized cool temperature regime of the area and the high relief kelp forest habitat.

Larry Allen|Age and growth of the Giant Sea Bass, Stereolepis gigas|Holly A Hawk, Larry G Allen|2014/12/1|CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS|55||128-134|SCRIPPS INST OCEANOGRAPHY|The giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas, is the largest bony fish that inhabits California shallow rocky reef communities and is listed by IUCN as a critically endangered species, yet little is known about its life history. To address questions of growth and longevity, 64 samples were obtained through collaborative efforts with commercial fish markets and scientific gillnetting. Sagittae (otoliths) were cross-sectioned and analyzed with digital microscopy. Age estimates indicate that S. gigas is a long-lived species attaining at least 76 years of age. over 90% of the variation between age (years) and standard length (mm) was accounted for in the von Bertalanffy growth model (R2= 0.911). The calculated von Bertalanffy growth function parameters (k= 0.044, t0=–0.339, l∞= 2026.2 mm Sl) for S. gigas were characteristic of a large, slow-growing, apex predator. 
Larry Allen|Ecological Classiﬁcation|LARRY G ALLEN, DANIEL J PONDELLA II|2006/2/15|The Ecology of Marine Fishes: California and Adjacent Waters|||81|Univ of California Press|The marine environment off the California coastline supports a diverse ichthyofauna consisting of northern, cold water (Oregonian) and southern, warm water (San Diegan) ﬁsh species as well as Panamic species primarily from Cortez Province (Horn and Allen, 1978). To a large extent, this high faunal diversity reﬂects the great variety of marine habitats that are available to ﬁshes within the expansive latitudinal range covered by California proper and Baja California (eg, bays and estuaries, nearshore soft bottom, shelf, slope, rocky intertidal, kelp beds, shallow and deep rocky reefs, as well as pelagic habitats)(Horn, 1980). Fortunately, the ﬁshes of these various California habitats have been the subject of numerous ichthyofaunal studies (see table 4-1) during the past 40 years. These studies allow us to ask and begin to answer one of the most fundamental questions of all,“Which ﬁshes occur where in California’s marine waters?” In the Californias, marine ﬁshes are readily quantiﬁable by various techniques and, in terms of taxonomy, are relatively well understood compared to other groups of organisms. Data from these ecological and ﬁshery surveys can be applied easily to models of numerical ecology. For these reasons, the descriptions of marine habitats and inferences about them can be made using data obtained from the study of these ﬁshes. In fact, the major biogeographical provinces in the tropical eastern Paciﬁc have been described using information from ﬁsh surveys (Hastings, 2000). More speciﬁcally, this chapter will seek to answer the following questions: 
Larry Allen|The life history and ecology of black croaker, Cheilotrema saturnum|LARRY G ALLEN, KEVIN T HERBINSON|2008/11/1||||||Results from spatial and temporal distribution analysis of 5,157 black croaker (Cheilotrema saturnum) collected by gillnet from 1995–2004 at stations from Newport to Santa Barbara, California, including Santa Catalina Island, indicated that peak catch per unit effort (CPUE) occurred along the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Annual gillnet CPUE was greatest in 2000. The highest black croaker abundance was recorded in 1997 using standardized impingement data from two Santa Monica Bay generating stations. Length-frequency analyses from both gill net and impingement sampling indicated that a large proportion of black croaker were small in size immediately prior to and during the 1997–98 El Niño Southern Oscillation, and then increased in size with time. Observed black croaker ages ranged up to 21 years old, with most fish less than 14 years old. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞= 237.7, k= 0.31, t0=–1.778, and N= 779, with no significant differences between the sexes. Gonosomatic indices peaked in June, followed by August, suggesting late-spring to summer spawning. Mortality adjusted hindcasting indicated that peak recruitment occurred in 1997.

However, recent findings suggest a nascent return of the critically endangered giant sea bass (Stereolepis gigas) to southern California. To provide the first population assessment of giant sea bass, surveys were conducted during the 2014/2015 summers off Santa Catalina Island, CA. Eight sites were surveyed on both the windward and leeward side of Santa Catalina Island every two weeks from June through August. Of the eight sites, three aggregations were identified at Goat Harbor, The V’s, and Little Harbor, CA. These three aggregation sites, the largest containing 24 individuals, contained a mean stock biomass of 19.6 kg/1000 m2 over both summers. Over the course of both summers the giant sea bass population was primarily made up of 1.2 - 1.3 m TL individuals with several small and newly mature fish … 
Larry Allen|Low contemporary effective population size detected in the Critically Endangered giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas, due to fisheries overexploitation|Chris L Chabot, Holly A Hawk, Larry G Allen|2015/12/1|Fisheries Research|172||71-78|Elsevier|The giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas (Polyprionidae), is the largest teleost distributed in the northeastern Pacific from California to northern Mexico and has been overexploited by fisheries for more than a century. As a consequence of this historic exploitation, populations collapsed throughout the region in the last century resulting in the listing of the species as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Recently, numbers of giant sea bass have been increasing within the region due primarily to the banning of the near shore gill net fishery in California waters in 1994. To assess population structure, the impact of historic exploitation on the genetic diversity and effective population size of the species, and to detect signs of recent population expansions, individuals from throughout the northeastern Pacific (n = 61; Northern Channel Islands, CA to San Quintín, Baja California) were sequenced at the mitochondrial control …

To assess population genetic structure of the California Halibut, we analyzed mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences from 375 individuals across a large portion of its native range. Nucleotide diversity was consistently low among sampling sites (π  =  0.0026 ± 0.0017), while haplotype diversity was consistently high (h  =  0.77 ± 0.024). We found that California Halibut were genetically homogeneous across sampled sites with an overall Φst  =  0.0030 (p  =  0.22). We saw no evidence of genetic discontinuities at two previously recognized marine phylogeographic breaks in the Los Angeles region or across the California Transition Zone at Point Conception. We conclude that California Halibut are genetically homogeneous and experience … 
Larry Allen|Observations on the mating behavior of captive spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus)|Eric F Miller, Larry G Allen|2006/4|Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences|105|1|17-30|Southern California Academy of Sciences|The sex allocation pattern of various populations of spotted sand bass are thought to vary from functional gonochorism to strict protogyny. The development of hypotheses explaining how such a plastic (flexible) strategy has been maintained selectively has been hindered by a general lack of information on reproductive behavior in this species. Therefore, the spawning behavior of adult, wild-caught spotted sand bass were observed in captivity under a variety of densities. Three distinct spawning modes were observed: 1) pair spawning, 2) group spawning, and 3) spawning including a sneaker male. Courtship was characterized by the following sequence: 1) a male or males approach the females, 2) one or more males make contact with the ventro-lateral surface of the female and chase the female, 3) the male contacts the ventro-lateral surface of the female and pushes her through a vertical spawning rush …

Four sites with different relative densities were visited daily throughout the summer spawning season and once a month throughout the spring and fall. Group spawning was the dominant mating system among smaller individuals (<200 mm) with 8–12 individuals in the spawning aggregations. Large (>200 mm) terminal phase males held territories which were 4–5 m2 and were observed courting on multiple occasions in an attempt to pair spawn, but only three pair spawns were witnessed during the study. Elaborate courtship displays, including vertical rushes and lateral displays by the males within their territory, preceded pair spawning attempts. Spawning occurred primarily in the morning, but …

This admittedly instantaneous measurement indicated a diet overlap of 69.8%, a possible estimate of the degree that juvenile Pacific sandfish and pink salmon fry shared the same food supply at this particular life stage. Stomach contents of the salmon were more digested than those of the Pacific sandfish and may reflect differences in metabolism or time elapsed since the last meal. Mixed schooling of juvenile Pacific sandfish and pink salmon may be only an artifact of their similar size, swimming speed and feeding habits; however, both species may benefit from their association in nearshore areas. Schooling is generally believed to protect prey from predators by reducing the time a visually orienting predator has to align with an individual prey, and as size of prey schools increases, the percent of …

Numbers of Giant Sea Bass observed at Goat Harbor ranged from 1 to 19 individuals with an average of 6. Giant Sea Bass produced booming sounds (40–80 Hz), which were often associated with aggressive behavior but may also be associated with courtship. Courtship behavior was observed during the late afternoons and was most prominent around dusk (1900–2100 h). Courtship involved sexually dimorphic, temporary color changes and displays such as circling in pairs and the nudging of the abdominal area of the presumed female by the snout of the presumed male.

Larry Allen|Year-class strength predicts commercial catch 11 years later for white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, off southern California|Dwin Leung, Larry G Allen|2016/9/1|California Fish and Game|102|4|175-182||Fisheries in the past have undergone collapse due to over-exploitation of a target species beyond natural replenishment. White seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) has been a commercial fishery species in Southern California since the late 1800s and a popular recreational species since the mid-20th century (Hervas et al. 2010). A decline in their numbers was seen in the early 1900s and by 1982 caused the commercial white seabass fishery to move operations offshore and abide by management regulations. The change in white seabass recreational catch was dramatic and attributed to overfishing, declining from a peak of 64,000 individuals in 1949 to 284 in 1978 (Vojkovich and Reed 1983, Vojkovich & Crooke 2001). Over the last two decades, the population of white seabass along the coast of California appears to be rising. The Marine Resource Protection Act in 1994 imposed restrictions by limiting fishing depth along the California coast and Channel Islands in addition to the state wide ban in the use of gill and trammel nets, resulting in a significant increase in white seabass numbers between 1995-2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008). White seabass commercial take was low in 1997 with 26 t and in 1998 greatly increased to 70 t (California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations [CalCOFI] 1999). Recent reports indicate that the combined commercial and recreational catch during 2008 was 342 t (CalCOFI 2009), and increased slightly to 364 t in 2010 (CalCOFI 2011). Year-class strength is an index that uses measures of abundance, survivorship, or recruitment rates to summarize the success of a species for a given year (Landsman et al. 2011 …

OF FISH & GAME|The purpose of this study was to re-evaluate the age and growth of the California barracuda, Sphyraena argentea, previously studied only by the interpretation of scale annuli, and to provide contemporary estimates of batch fecundity. Current data were compared with the results of two previous studies: Walford (1932) and Pinkas (1966). Barracuda were collected from various mainland and island locations in the Southern California Bight from San Diego to Santa Barbara using gillnets and hook and line from April 2000 to October 2002. Subsamples of mature oocytes from preserved ovaries were counted by eye to determine batch fecundity, which was best correlated to fish mass (R2= 0.40, df= 21, P= 0.001). Batch fecundity, as a function of mass, did not differ significantly from previously reported values (ANCOVA, F= 0.535, df= 1, 31, P= 0.470). For the first time, barracuda were aged using sectioned sagittal otoliths and data were fit to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Age classes 0-XVIII were represented and the growth rate was fast during the first year for both sexes. Females were significantly longer than males at every age class (ANCOVA, F= 3.934, df= 1, 402, P= 0.048). A subset of fish was also aged using scale analysis to facilitate comparison to previous studies. Scales were deemed unreliable as aging structures for fish older than 4 years, however, otolith-determined ages were not significantly different from scale ages for age classes 0 to IV (ANCOVA, F= 0.105, df= 1, 75, P= 0.746). The current study collected more young-of-the-year S. argentea than historical studies. Additionally, otolith analysis provided greater age class resolution … 
Larry Allen|Captive Breeding of Spotted Sand Bass, Paralabrax maculatofasciatus, in Southern California|Eric F Miller, Larry G Allen|2006/3/1|CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME|92|2|98|CALIFORNIA DEPT. OF FISH & GAME|Spotted sand bass, Para/abrax maculatofasciatus, ranges from Mazatlan, Mexico to Monterey, California including lhe Gulf of California, in depths out to 60 m (Miller and Lea 1972, Thomson et al. 2000). In southern California, spotted sand bass commonly inhabit shallow waan waters in embayments and harbors above bottom structure, predominantly eelgrass beds (Limbaugh 19551, Alleo 1985, AlleoetaJ. 1995, Hovey and Allen 2000). Unlike other members of the genus common to southern California (kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, and barred sand bass, P. nebulifer), spotted sand bass adults are generally restricted to coastal embaymeots, with little or no migration along lhe open coast as adults (LG Allen. personal observation). lt has been hypothesized that southern California populations are maintained only through the dispersal of planktonic larvae along the open coast, which can lead to years of depressed recruitment when oceanic conditions are not suitable to spotted sand bass larval development, ie sea surface temperatures in excess of20C {Allen etaL 1995). Throughout their range, spotted sand bass exhibit high growth rates and early sexual maturity {< I year of age; Allen et al. 1995). However, they areshon-lived, with most individuals dying well before their I 0111 year in the Sou them California Bight {Allen et al. 1995).

This study looks at barred sand bass (commonly, sand bass), Paralabrax nebulifer, a commonly fished species in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Sand bass form large spawning aggregations in the summer months of June-August, which makes them highly susceptible to overfishing. In the last decade, populations of sand bass in southern California have experienced a severe decline in numbers and subsequently the recreational fishery has been seriously impacted. Large population declines, such as a fishery decline, can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and potentially a genetic bottleneck. This is a concern for barred sand bass populations; however, the population structure and genetic diversity of barred sand bass populations was previously unknown. This study looks at both aspects using the d-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers for populations throughout California and Mexico. Samples of barred sand bass were collected between 1997 and 1999 and from 2010 to 2013. DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR for the mitochondrial DNA control region and for microsatellite primers developed for barred sand bass. Microsatellite primers were designed and tested for this study. Both markers show a high degree of genetic diversity indicating one large, panmictic population …

This study provides information on length-weight relationships, age, and growth of these two ecologically important species. Opaleye and halfmoon were collected from throughout the Southern California Bight to evaluate these life history characteristics. Length-weight relationships were described by the equations W5 0.00002 L3. 081 for opaleye and W5 0.000003 L3. 454 for halfmoon. Sagittal otoliths were used to age opaleye from ages 3–10 and halfmoon from ages 0–8. In addition, age classes 0-II for opaleye were determined from length frequency analysis of preserved specimens. Von Bertalanffy growth curves were fitted to mean standard length (mm) at age for each species. Opaleye were aged … 
Chhandak Basu|Plant terpenoids: applications and future potentials|Sam Zwenger, Chhandak Basu|2008|Biotechnology and Molecular Biology Reviews|3|1|1|Academic Journals|The importance of terpenes in both nature and human application is difficult to overstate. Basic knowledge of terpene and isoprene biosynthesis and chemistry has accelerated the pace at which scientists have come to understand many plant biochemical and metabolic processes. The abundance and diversity of terpene compounds in nature can have ecosystem-wide influences. Although terpenes have permeated human civilization since the Egyptians, terpene synthesis pathways are only now being understood in great detail. The use of bioinformatics and molecular databases has largely contributed to analyzing exactly how and when terpenes are synthesized. Additionally, terpene synthesis is beginning to be understood in respect to the various stages of plant development. Much of this knowledge has been contributed by the plant model, Arabidopsis thaliana. Considering the advances in plant terpene knowledge and potential uses, it is conceivable that they may soon be used in agrobiotechnology.

Gas-phase chemical reactions initiate the removal of these compounds from the atmosphere, which ultimately proceeds via deposition at the surface or direct oxidation to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. We performed ecosystem-scale flux measurements that show that the removal of oxygenated VOC via dry deposition is substantially larger than is currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up-regulation of various stress-related genes, leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding. A revised scheme for the uptake of oxygenated VOCs, incorporated into a global chemistry-transport model, predicts appreciable regional changes in annual dry …

Chhandak Basu|Weed genomics: new tools to understand weed biology|Chhandak Basu, Matthew D Halfhill, Thomas C Mueller, C Neal Stewart Jr|2004/8/1||9|8|391-398|Elsevier Current Trends|In spite of the large yield losses that weeds inflict on crops, we know little about the genomics of economically important weed species. Comparative genomics between plant model species and weeds, map-based approaches, genomic sequencing and functional genomics can play vital roles in understanding and dissecting weedy traits of agronomically important weed species that damage crops. Weed genomics research should increase our understanding of the evolution of herbicide resistance and of the basic genetics underlying traits that make weeds a successful group of plants. Here, we propose specific weed candidates as genomic models, including economically important plants that have evolved herbicide resistance on several occasions and weeds with good comparative genomic qualities that can be anchored to the genomics of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa. 
Chhandak Basu|The production of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in a transgenic strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis|Robert E Reinsvold, Robert E Jinkerson, Randor Radakovits, Matthew C Posewitz, Chhandak Basu|2011/5/15|Journal of plant physiology|168|8|848-852|Urban & Fischer|The plant secondary metabolite, β-caryophyllene, is a ubiquitous component of many plant resins that has traditionally been used in the cosmetics industry to provide a woody, spicy aroma to cosmetics and perfumes. Clinical studies have shown it to be potentially effective as an antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, there is significant interest in engineering phototrophic microorganisms with sesquiterpene synthase genes for the production of biofuels. Currently, the isolation of β-caryophyllene relies on purification methods from oleoresins extracted from large amounts of plant material. An engineered cyanobacterium platform that produces β-caryophyllene may provide a more sustainable and controllable means of production. To this end, the β-caryophyllene synthase gene (QHS1) from Artemisia annua was stably inserted, via double homologous recombination, into the genome of the …

During the current investigation, the effect of drought, heat, and drought plus heat stresses was compared in the leaves of two soybean varieties, Surge and Davison, combining 2D-DIGE proteomic data with physiology and biochemical analyses. We demonstrated how 25 differentially expressed photosynthesis-related proteins affect RuBisCO regulation, electron transport, Calvin cycle, and carbon fixation during drought and heat stress. We also observed higher abundance of heat stress-induced EF-Tu protein in Surge. It is possible that EF-Tu might have activated heat tolerance mechanisms in the soybean. Higher level expressions of heat shock-related protein seem to be regulating the heat tolerance mechanisms. This study identifies the differential expression of various abiotic stress-responsive proteins that regulate various molecular processes and signaling cascades. One inevitable outcome from the biochemical and proteomics assays of this study is that increase of ROS levels during drought stress does not show significant changes at the phenotypic level in Davison and this seems to be due to a higher amount of carbonic anhydrase accumulation in the cell which aids the cell to become more resistant to cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2. 
Chhandak Basu|Use of β-glucuronidase reporter gene for gene expression analysis in turfgrasses|Chhandak Basu, Albert P Kausch, Joel M Chandlee|2004/7/16|Biochemical and biophysical research communications|320|1|7-10|Academic Press|The β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene has been successfully used as a reporter gene in innumerable number of plant species. The functional GUS gene produces blue coloration in plants upon integration into the plant genome. Because of the ease it provides to analyze the gene expression (as no expensive equipment is needed), GUS gene is surely plant biotechnologist’s first choice as a reporter gene. The turfgrass family contains the world’s most economically important horticultural crops. There is a world-wide drive for genetic modification of grasses due to its huge economic importance. GUS gene can be transiently or stably expressed in grasses for the purpose of promoter analysis and to study tissue-specific and developmental gene expression. This paper summarizes the use of GUS gene for transient and stable expression studies in various turfgrass species.

Penn A4) following microprojectile bombardment. The constructs analyzed consisted of the uidA (GUS) reporter gene driven by four different promoters (ubiquitin 3-potato, ubiquitin corn, ubiquitin rice and CaMV 35S). The total number of GUS hits (or transient expression units; TEUs) were determined manually under a dissecting scope after histochemical staining for GUS. Results suggest that the ubiquitin rice promoter is most active in cells of turfgrass, regardless of the developmental stage or tissue-type. The ubiquitin corn promoter was the next best. Of the four promoter used, except for ubiquitin 3-potato, reporter gene activity was dramatically higher in mature leaves compared to young leaves. The relative …

In order to generate a marker to select between hybrids of glyphosate resistant (GR) and glyphosate susceptible (GS) horseweed, a GR horseweed accession from western Tennessee was transformed with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene. The GFP marker allowed for the simple and accurate determination of GR hybrid plants by visual observation. GR plants were shown to be transgenic via the green fluorescence under UV light, and resistant to glyphosate when sprayed with the field-use-rate 0.84 kg acid equivalent ha−1 of glyphosate (i.e. RoundupTM) herbicide. An in vitro screen for glyphosate resistance in seedlings was developed, and a 5 μM glyphosate concentration was found to reduce dry weight in GS seedlings but not in GR seedlings. The GR plants containing GFP … 
Chhandak Basu|Comparative analyses of plant transcription factor databases|Silvia R Ramirez, Chhandak Basu|2009/3/1|Current genomics|10|1|10-17|Bentham Science Publishers|Transcription factors (TFs) are proteinaceous complex, which bind to the promoter regions in the DNA and affect transcription initiation. Plant TFs control gene expressions and genes control many physiological processes, which in turn trigger cascades of biochemical reactions in plant cells. The databases available for plant TFs are somewhat abundant but all convey different information and in different formats. Some of the publicly available plant TF databases may be narrow, while others are broad in scopes. For example, some of the best TF databases are ones that are very specific with just one plant species, but there are also other databases that contain a total of up to 20 different plant species. In this review plant TF databases ranging from a single species to many will be assessed and described. The comparative analyses of all the databases and their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed.

The disease causes severe injury to putting greens and can kill large stands of turfgrass. For some time, however, both the bacterial origin of the disease and the causal agent were in doubt. In order to investigate the identity of the causal agent, isolation of the pathogen was undertaken and pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's postulates on P. annua. Additional pathogenicity trials then were undertaken to determine the host range of the causal bacterium. Ability of the bacterium to cause disease was restricted to P. annua var. annua and P. attenuata. However, the bacterium was able to survive asymptomatically in vascular systems of P. annua var. reptans and P. trivialis. Experiments to determine the optimal growth temperature of the organism demonstrated that the bacterial growth …

The exact mechanism of stress tolerance during cryopreservation is unknown. Unavavailability of a detailed protocol for understanding the moelcular genetics of plant cryostress is a major obstacle in plant cryobiology research. This paper describes the methods of extraction of total RNA from cryogenically stored plant tissues accompanied by successful amplication of cDNAs by reverse transcriptase PCR. The whole process can be completed in two to three days. Through this protocol, several genes were indentified which were differentially expressed during cryostress. This protocol will help researchers to pursue further research in the field of molecular genetics of plant cryostress. Interesting genes identified via these processes can be cloned and plants can be transfomred for the purpose of trait enhancement and modification.

It is advantageous compared to traditional gel-based method of PCR, as gene expression can be visualized “real-time” using a computer. In qPCR, a reporter dye system is used which intercalates with DNA’s region of interest and detects DNA amplification. Some of the popular reporter systems used in qPCR are the following: Molecular Beacon®, SYBR Green®, and Taqman®. However, success of qPCR depends on the optimal primers used. Some of the considerations for primer design are the following: GC content, primer self-dimer, or secondary structure formation. Freely available software could be used for ideal qPCR primer design.

With the advancements in genomic tools, we have more information on genes, which are up- or down-regulated in plants due to heat stress. The heat-stressed plants may exhibit various physiological responses, including stomatal closure, suppressed photosynthesis, stunted growth, etc. Microarray and transcriptome sequencing gave us the tools to perform genome-wide expression profiling in heat-stressed plants. Understanding how gene expression in heat-stressed plants works will help us to discover …

MBO has a high energy content making it superior to ethanol in terms of energy output, and due to its volatility and lower solubility in water, MBO is easier to recover than ethanol. Pine’s MBO synthase enzyme utilizes the intermediate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) produced by the methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate isoprenoid pathway for the production of MBO. In this study, we performed metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli to express an alternate mevalonate dependent pathway for production of DMAPP, along with a codon optimized Pinus sabiniana MBO synthase gene. This heterologous expressed pathway carried out the conversion of an acetyl CoA precursor to DMAPP leading to production of MBO.

Wiley-Blackwell, USA|||11-24||This chapter offers a list of molecular tools that should be useful to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis of weediness. A large majority of agriculturists and botanists alike seek to understand weediness traits on a molecular level, and perhaps, in some cases, even use the information to help control weeds in agriculture. Before one attempts to defeat an enemy, one should learn its characteristic strengths and weaknesses and use them advantageously. Toward that end, we list various molecular markers and tools such as map-based cloning and functional genomics that should help in determining these characteristics.

When callus tissue was incubated for 24 h with heparin, spermidine, aurintricarboxylic acid or polyethylene glycol, only heparin and spermidine were effective as in vitro nuclease inhibitors, protecting exogenously added plasmid DNA from degradation. When β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene activity was evaluated in heparin-treated (0.6%), 14-month old callus following microprojectile bombardment, GUS activity increased 1000-fold compared to equivalent aged untreated Penn A4 callus. Similar enhancement from heparin pretreatment (0.6% or 1.2%) was not observed in 6-month old callus. This is likely due to much higher activities of nuclease in the younger callus.

Chhandak Basu|Revisiting the dry depositional sink of oxidized organic vapors to vegetation|Thomas Karl, Peter Harley, Luisa Emmons, Brenda Thornton, Alex Guenther, Chhandak Basu, Andrew Turnipseed, Kolby Jardine|2010/5|Geophys Res Abstr|12||||Large quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOC) enter the atmosphere. The annual production of VOC (600-2000 TgC/a) likely exceeds that of methane and CO (~ 500 TgC/a each). Together these gases fuel tropospheric chemistry. Oxidation of VOC leads to the formation of aerosol (Hallquist et al., 2009) via complex organic chemistry (eg Atkinson and Arey, 2003; Paulot et al., 2009) in the gas and aerosol phase thereby modulating the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere (Lelieveld et al., 2008). Currently one of the biggest uncertainties in constraining budgets of VOC is the amount of dry and wet deposition to vegetation, which acts as a major source and sink for organic trace gases on a global scale. This has consequences for constraining secondary species produced in the gasphase, which will either oxidize to CO and CO2, condense on or form organic aerosol (OA) and be rained out, or directly deposit to the surface via dry and wet deposition. Two recent bottom-up assessments of the tropospheric OA budget (Hallquist et al., 2009, Goldstein and Galbally, 2007) were based on varying assumptions for wet and dry deposition of organic vapors (eg 130-200 TgC/a vs 800 TgC/a) and consequently derived significantly different global production rates for secondary organic aerosol (SOA). We present a synthesis of ecosystem scale flux measurements showing that the removal of oxygenated VOC (OVOC) via dry deposition is significantly larger than currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate that exposure to ozone, MVK or mechanical wounding can enhance the uptake of OVOCs. Since the general route …

In our study we evaluated the functional potential of the enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis of plants called ACC (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase which converts precursor ACC to ethylene. Studies on ethylene have proven that it is effective in improving the flood tolerance in plants. Thus our goal was to understand the potential of ACC oxidase gene overexpression in providing flood tolerance in transgenic plants. ACC oxidase gene was PCR amplified and inserted into the pBINmgfp5-er vector, under the control of a constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus promoter. GV101 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing recombinant pBINmgfp5-er vector (referred herein as pBIN-ACC) was used for plant transformation by the ‘floral dip’ method. The transformants were identified through … 
Chhandak Basu|An overview of advances in plant genomics in the new millennium|Robert J Henry|2016/4/19||||37-59|CRC Press|The technologies available for genomics have continued to develop rapidly since 2000, accelerating their application in plant biology and plant breeding. These technologies are providing the tools to allow costeffective collection of much larger volumes of data on plant genomes. This, in turn, requires the development of bioinformatics capabilities to analyze these data and apply them successfully in plant improvement. Genomics, in a general sense, is advancing by improvements in technology at each of the levels from studies of DNA (genomics) and RNA (transcriptomics), which are often considered a core part of genomics, to proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics) and the phenotypes (phenomics)(Table 1). 
Chhandak Basu|Transcriptional analyses of an ethanol inducible promoter in Escherichia coli and tobacco for production of cellulase and green fluorescent protein|Homa Hemmati, Chhandak Basu|2015/11/2|Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment|29|6|1043-1052|Taylor & Francis|Cellulase is a widely used enzyme for saccharification of plant cell walls for the production of biofuels. In our work, we tested an ethanol inducible native alcA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and tobacco. The alcA promoter was fused with a cellulase gene and then the promoter was compared with other widely used promoters, namely, T5 and cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S in E. coli. We also tested the activity of alcA promoter in tobacco by transiently expressing a green fluorescent protein gene under the control of alcA promoter. We concluded from our quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results that when alcA promoter was expressed along with AlcR transcription factor, the alcA promoter was 11 times more active than the T5 promoter. The qPCR data suggested that there may be a direct correlation between AlcR concentrations and alcA activity, indicating a key …

We found over production of phytol in Nostoc punctiforme by expressing a 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) synthase gene. MBO synthase catalyzes the conversion of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) into MBO, a volatile hemiterpene alcohol, in Pinus sabiniana. The result of enhanced phytol production in N. punctiforme, instead of MBO, could be explained by one of the 2 models: either the presence of a native prenyltransferase enzyme with a broad substrate specificity, or appropriation of a MBO synthase metabolic intermediate by a native geranyl diphosphate (GDP) synthase. In this work, an expression vector with an indigenous petE promoter for gene expression in the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme was constructed and MBO synthase gene expression was successfully shown using reverse transcriptase (RT … 
Chhandak Basu|Extraction of RNA from Recalcitrant Tree Species Paulownia elongata|Niveditha Ramadoss, Chhandak Basu|2018/7/20|Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|||||Isolation of pure RNA is the basic requisite for most molecular biology work. Plants contain polyphenols and polysaccharides, which can interfere with isolation of pure RNA from them. Especially hardwood tree species like Paulownia elongata have surplus amount of RNA-binding alkaloids, proteins and secondary metabolites that can further complicate the process of RNA extraction. Paulownia elongata is a fast-growing tree species which is known for its role in environmental adaptability and biofuel research. Here we describe an economical, efficient and time-saving method (2 h) to extract RNA from leaf tissues of the tree Paulownia elongata. Lack of DNA contamination and good RNA integrity were confirmed using RNA Gel electrophoresis. The purity of RNA was confirmed using Nanodrop spectrophotometer that revealed an A 260: A 280 ratio of about 2.0. The purified RNA was successfully used in the downstream applications such as RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR) and qPCR (quantitative PCR). This method could be used for RNA extraction from several other recalcitrant tree species.

The UCI Fluxtron is designed for automated, continuous measurement of plant physiology and multi-modal BVOC chemical analysis from multiple plants. It consists of two controlled-environment walk-in growth chambers that contain several plant enclosures, a gas make-up system to precisely control the … 
Chhandak Basu|Transcriptional Profiling|Sam R Zwenger, Chhandak Basu|2016/4/19||||460-482|CRC Press|Within the last decade, there has been rapid advancement in expression profiling of all organisms, including plants. The study of transcripts, primarily those of mRNA origin, has become one of many ‘omics’ characters to appear on the stage of molecular biology. Transcriptomics, the specific discipline, which aims to characterize organisms’ transcripts, is heavily involved in understanding the patterns of gene expression. These patterns are variable under certain environmental conditions, for example, during different life stages, or within a particular tissue. Research has come to show that although housekeeping genes may be constitutively expressed, other genes are not necessarily expressed all of the time (eg, stress-response genes). While one might only focus on an organism’s mRNA transcripts, other factors (promoters, cis-and transacting elements, transcription factors, enhancers, siRNA etc.) are necessarily …

Volatile components of fresh tea leaves and green tea of Suncheon and Namwon were detected by headspace-GC/MS. The mean annual rainfall and air temperature of Suncheon is higher than that of Namwon. A total of 57 different constituents were identified and qualitative and quantitative differences were observed among the samples. Fresh tea leaves and green tea of Namwon contained more components than that of Suncheon. Composition of volatile component of green tea was changed by the storage duration, namely the longer storage duration, the smaller was the number of volatile components. Percentage of some volatile components in the green tea was decreased with storage duration, the content of some components have gone with storage duration.

The advancements in molecular tools such as expressed sequence tag (EST) library construction provide a novel opportunity for insight into the physiology of this tree. We generated a small set of ESTs for a young copaiba, sequencing and annotating a total of 613 unigenes. Of these, 84% showed similarity to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Annotation showed 70% of unigenes had at least one associated Gene Ontology (GO) term. We found a majority of ESTs to be associated with heat response genes. Based on these data, this EST library of C. officinalis represents a small but important step in helping to understand the general physiology and heat-response expression patterns. Additionally, this small collection of EST offers a modest starting point in helping to understand this enigmatic tropical plant.

The complete sequence of genome of model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was a boost for plant genomics research. Following the path of Arabidopsis sequencing, hundreds of plant genomes are being sequenced and we have ocean of sequence data. It is a challenge for us to interpret the functions of thousands of genes. Surely, computational biology will be a great help in predicting functions of plant genes. Publicly available web based sequence annotation softwares are another resource to annotate and characterize plant genes. It is a challenge and responsibility for plant biologists to provide food, fiber and fuel for this exponentially increasing population. Sequences of model plants and crop plants will help us to understand the genome architectures of the plants and will help us to …

Heat stress and insect wounding have been associated with an increase in the release of stored and de novo synthesized BVOCs. These BVOCs are released into the atmosphere, where they can interact with nitrous oxides to create ozone and alter cloud properties via the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). To determine the source of the BVOCs being released (stored vs. de novo), we subjected both species (Ponderosa and Hymenaea) to heat stress and methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment. The temperature in the growth chamber containing the trees was increased from 24 C to 40 C (Ponderosa) or 27 C to 42 C (Hymenaea), and BVOCs were collected using leaf …

These compounds induce genetic damages in the exposed cells such as buccal cells. The study was carried out on the mechanical workshop workers to investigate micronuclei (MN) formation in the exposed subjects. The formation in the cells was evaluated by using MN test. The applied buccal cells as sensitive sources showed the genotoxic and cytotoxic damages which could accompany ageing. Difference in MN frequency between the workers and controls was statistically significant (p = 0.001). It showed statistically significant difference between the older and younger groups in the workers and controls (p = 0.001) as well. The results showed that the occupational exposure increased MN frequency in the workers. It was concluded that the induced genomic damages could act as an accelerating … 
Chhandak Basu|Gene flow and introgression from transgenic crops to weeds|Chhandak Basu, Matthew D Halfhill, Thomas C Mueller, C Neal Stewart|2004|Trends in Plant Science|8|9|391-398||In spite of the large yield losses that weeds inflict on crops, we know little about the genomics of economically important weed species. Comparative genomics between plant model species and weeds, map-based approaches, genomic sequencing and functional genomics can play vital roles in understanding and dissecting weedy traits of agronomically important weed species that damage crops. Weed genomics research should increase our understanding of the evolution of herbicide resistance and of the basic genetics underlying traits that make weeds a successful group of plants. Here, we propose specific weed candidates as genomic models, including economically important plants that have evolved herbicide resistance on several occasions and weeds with good comparative genomic qualities that can be anchored to the genomics of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa.

DegreeYear: 2003 Institute: University of Rhode Island Embryogenic callus was generated from seeds of turfgrass species (creeping bentgrass, cv. Penn A4 and Providence) on tissue culture medium. After 12 weeks, embryogenic calli were identified and used for bombardment with chimeric gene constructs that confer phosphinothricin resistance (bar) as a selectable marker and β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter gene. After bombardment, the calli were transferred to selection medium and then to regeneration medium. Putative transgenic turfgrass plants were generated and molecular analysis (PCR) was performed to confirm presence of the transgene (bar, GUS). We analyzed reporter gene (GUS) expression in turfgrass cells over a developmental time period of 15 days following microprojectile bombardment with a plasmid containing a GUS reporter gene driven by the ubiquitin rice promoter … 
Chhandak Basu|Relationship between Nitrate Leaching under Turf and Nitrate Uptake by Turfgrasses|John W Pote, Chhandak Basu, Zhongchun Jiang, W Michael Sullivan|2000/8/1|HortScience|35|5|827B-827|American Society for Horticultural Science|Leaching-induced N losses have been shown to be minimal under turfgrasses. This is likely due to superior ability of turfgrasses to absorb nitrate. No direct evidence for this theory has been reported. The present study quantified nitrate leaching under miniature turf and nitrate uptake by individual turfgrass plants, and established the relationship between nitrate leaching loss and nitrate uptake rate. Seedlings of six Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars, `Blacksburg', `Barzan', `Connie', `Dawn', `Eclipse', and `Gnome', were planted individually in polystyrene containers filled with silica sand. The plants were irrigated with tap water or a nutrient solution containing 1 mm nitrate on alternate days and mowed to a 5-cm height once each week for 25 weeks. Nitrate leaching potential was then determined by applying 15 to 52 mL of nutrient solutions containing 7 to 70 mg·L-1 nitrate-N into the containers and … 
Chhandak Basu|Characterization of Nitrate Uptake by Kentucky Bluegrass at the Whole-plant and Organ Levels|Yuexia Wang, Chhandak Basu, Zhongchun Jiang, W Michael Sullivan|2000/8/1|HortScience|35|5|829D-829|American Society for Horticultural Science|It has been suggested that shoot demand for nitrogen controls nitrate uptake in plant roots. In turfgrasses, shoots are partly removed by regular mowing, which may severely alter nitrate uptake ability. However, reported groundwater nitrate concentrations under intensively managed turf are well below the USEPA maximum contaminant limit of 10 mg·L-1 nitrate-N in potable water. We hypothesize that the turfgrass root can also exert significant control over its nitrate uptake ability. The present study was to test this hypothesis by comparing nitrate uptake rates of excised roots and intact, whole plants of six Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars. Three replications or cultures of each cultivar were grown in sand for 15 months. For whole-plant nitrate uptake, the roots were placed in a flask filled with 200 mL of a nutrient solution containing 0.125 mm nitrate. Nitrate depletion was monitored at 20-minute intervals …

Chhandak Basu|Measuring the dry depositional sink of oxidized organic vapors to vegetation using PTRMS|Thomas Karl, Peter Harley, Luisa Emmons, Brenda Thornton, Chhandak Basu, Alex Guenther, Andrew Turnipseed, Kolby Jardine|||||||In recent years PTR-MS technology has played a significant role for quantitative analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in environmental sciences. Due to its rapid sample analysis capability PTRMS has been particularly useful in combination with micrometeorological measurement strategies. Analysis of oxygenated VOC (oVOCs) fluxes from past measurement campaigns reveals a significant uncertainty in the dry depositional flux of oVOCs Large quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOC) enter the atmosphere. The annual production of VOC (600-2000 TgC/a) likely exceeds that of methane and CO (~ 500 TgC/a each). Together these gases fuel tropospheric chemistry. Oxidation of VOC leads to the formation of aerosol (Hallquist et al., 2009) via complex organic chemistry (eg Atkinson and Arey, 2003; Paulot et al., 2009) in the gas and aerosol phase thereby modulating the oxidation capacity of the …

Here, we demonstrate that genetically engineered Salmonella have many of the desirable properties of a delivery vector, including targeting of multiple tumors from a distant inoculation site, selective replication within tumors, tumor retardation, and the ability to express effector genes, such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK). When wild-type Salmonella were introduced into melanoma-bearing mice, the bacteria were found within the tumor at levels exceeding 109 per g, although as pathogens, they caused the death of the mice. However, when attenuated, hyperinvasive auxotrophic mutants were used, the tumor-targeting and amplification phenomena were retained, whereas their pathogenicity was limited. With such attenuated strains, the tumor:liver ratios ranged between 250:1 and 9000:1. When these auxotrophs were …

Genetic modifications of tumor-targeting Salmonella that alter lipid A and increase safety must, however, retain the useful properties of this bacteria. We report here that disruption of the Salmonella msbB gene reduces TNFα induction and increases the LD 50 of this pathogenic bacteria by 10,000-fold. Notwithstanding this enormous difference, Salmonella retains its tumor-targeting properties, exhibiting tumor accumulation ratios in excess of 1000: 1 compared with normal tissues. Administration of this bacteria to mice bearing melanoma results in tumors that are less than 6% the size of tumors in untreated controls at day 18.

David Bermudes|Bacteria as tumour-targeting vectors|John M Pawelek, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2003/9/1||4|9|548-556|Elsevier|Live bacteria were first actively used in the treatment of cancer nearly 150 years ago, work that ultimately led to the study of immunomodulation. Today, with the discovery of bacterial strains that specifically target tumours, and aided by genomic sequencing and genetic engineering, there is new interest in the use of bacteria as tumour vectors. Bifodobacterium, Clostridium, and Salmonella have all been shown to preferentially replicate within solid tumours when injected from a distal site, and all three types of bacteria have been used to transport and amplify genes encoding factors such as prodrug-converting enzymes, toxins, angiogenesis inhibitors, and cytokines. In this review we provide a historical discussion of this area, and describe the development of the bacteria, which are currently being prepared for use in clinical trials in patients with cancer.

David Bermudes|In vivo maintenance of synergistic cytarabine: daunorubicin ratios greatly enhances therapeutic efficacy|Paul Tardi, Sharon Johnstone, Natashia Harasym, Sherwin Xie, Troy Harasym, Natalia Zisman, Pierrot Harvie, David Bermudes, Lawrence Mayer|2009/1/1|Leukemia research|33|1|129-139|Pergamon|We demonstrate here that cytarabine and daunorubicin, a standard drug combination used in the treatment of leukaemia, exhibits drug ratio-dependent synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. A cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratio of 5:1 displayed the greatest degree of synergy and minimum antagonism in a panel of 15 tumor cell lines in vitro. Co-encapsulating cytarabine and daunorubicin inside liposomes maintained the synergistic drug ratio in plasma for 24 h post-injection. Liposome-encapsulated cytarabine:daunorubicin combinations exhibited drug ratio-dependent in vivo efficacy with the 5:1 molar drug ratio (designated CPX-351) having the greatest therapeutic index, despite using sub-MTD daunorubicin doses. CPX-351 exhibited superior therapeutic activity compared to free-drug cocktails, with high proportions of long-term survivors, consistent with in vivo synergy. The therapeutic advantage of …

Dense-granule exocytosis occurred in the apical area of the tachyzoite within minutes of invasion. Several exocytic events were found simultaneously in the same organism, both by serial sectioning and by freeze-fracture studies. Dense-granule contents were first found as a dense material trapped between parasite and vacuole membranes before either the vacuolar network or the vacuole membrane could be immunolabeled with specific antibodies. The vacuolar network was strongly labeled with dense-granule antibodies but not with the SAG1-specific probe, which suggests that the network is not enriched in membrane proteins. In addition to strongly labeling the vacuole membrane …

Several of the models showed improved survival times, but tumors eventually resumed growth, resulting in the death of the animals. The tumor site-related and systemic toxicities reported in preclinical studies of strictly anaerobic bacteria were not observed, although after a prolonged period, some subcutaneous tumors developed a central necrotic region. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis as a mechanism of evolution: status of cell symbiosis theory.|Lynn Margulis, D Bermudes|1985||1||101-124||Several theories for the origin of eukaryotic (nucleated) cells from prokaryotic (bacterial) ancestors have been published: the progenote, the direct filiation and the serial endosymbiotic theory (SET). Compelling evidence for two aspects of the SET is now available suggesting that both mitochondria and plastids originated by symbioses with a third type of microbe, probably a Thermoplasma-like archaebacterium ancestral to the nucleocytoplasm. We conclude that not enough information is available to negate or substantiate another SET hypothesis: that the undulipodia (cilia, eukaryotic flagella) evolved from spirochetes. Recognizing the power of symbiosis to recombine in single individual semes from widely differing partners, we develop the idea that symbiosis has been important in the origin of species and higher taxa. The abrupt origin of novel life forms through the formation of stable symbioses is consistent with certain patterns of evolution (eg punctuated equilibria) described by some paleontologists.

We have also isolated and sequenced cDNAs for NTP1 and NTP3; no cDNA for NTP2 was obtained. The two cDNA clones encode proteins that are more than 97% identical at the amino acid level but significantly differ within two small domains, indicating the presence of NTPase isoforms. Both possess N-terminal signal sequences and two regions with partial homology to certain known ATP binding motifs: the glycine-rich loop common to many ATP binding proteins and the beta-phosphate binding domain found …

The hydrophobicity of paclitaxel was increased by conjugating a succession of increasingly hydrophobic lipid anchors to the drug using succinate or diglycolate cross-linkers. The prodrugs were formulated in well defined block copolymer-stabilized nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to have an elimination half-life of approximately 24 h in vivo. The rate at which the prodrug was released from the nanoparticles could be controlled by adjusting the hydrophobicity of the lipid anchor, resulting in release half-lives ranging from 1 to 24 h. The diglycolate and succinate cross-linked prodrugs were 1−2 orders of magnitude less potent than paclitaxel in vitro. Nanoparticle formulations of the succinate prodrugs showed no evidence of efficacy in HT29 human colorectal tumor xenograph models. Efficacy of diglycolate …

Fusion hybrids were generated in vitro between weakly metastatic Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells and normal mouse or human macrophages. Hybrids were implanted s.c. in the tail and mice were monitored for metastases. Controls included parental S91 cells, autologous S91 × S91 hybrids, and B16F10 melanoma cells. Of 35 hybrids tested, most were more aggressive than the parental melanoma cells, producing metastases sooner and in more mice. A striking characteristic was heterogeneity amongst hybrids, with some lines producing no metastases and others producing metastases in up to 80% of mice. With few exceptions, hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also had the highest basal …

A quantitative relationship between the level of radioactivity accumulated and the number of bacteria in tumor and different tissues was demonstrated. The in vivo accumulation of [14 C] FIAU measured in tissue sample homogenates and sections were related to Salmonella number and to immunohistochemical bacterial staining, respectively. Quantitative autoradiography (QAR) revealed the relative intensity of [14 C] FIAU accumulation in a tumor cross-section, demonstrating that the peripheral region of the tumor …

The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration. TAPET-CD accumulated in tumors at levels 1000-fold higher than that in normal tissues and high levels of 5-FU were detected in tumors in mice treated with both TAPET-CD and 5-FC.

David Bermudes|Live bacteria as anticancer agents and tumor-selective protein delivery vectors.|David Bermudes, LM Zheng, Ivan C King|2002/3||5|2|194-199||The development of novel cancer therapies that are selective for cancer cells with limited toxicity to normal tissues is a challenge for oncology researchers. Microorganisms, such as viruses with selectivity for tumor cells or tumor micro-environments, have been investigated as potential arsenals for decades. Genetically-modified, non-pathogenic bacteria have begun to emerge as potential antitumor agents, either to provide direct tumoricidal effects or to deliver tumoricidal molecules. Attenuated Salmonella, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium are capable of multiplying selectively in tumors and inhibiting their growth, representing a new approach for cancer treatment. Because of their selectivity for tumor tissues, these bacteria would also be ideal vectors for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumors. VNP20009, an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, and its derivative, TAPET-CD, which expresses an Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD), are particularly promising, and are currently undergoing phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.

VNP20009 inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted B16F10 murine melanoma, and the human tumor xenografts Lox, DLD-1, A549, WiDr, HTB177, and MDA-MB-231. A single intravenous injection of VNP20009, at doses ranging from 1 × 104 to 3 × 106 cfu/mouse, produced tumor growth inhibitions of 57–95%. Tumor volume doubling time, another indicator for tumor growth inhibition, also significantly increased in mice treated with VNP20009. Using mice with immune system deficiencies, we also demonstrated that the antitumor effects of VNP20009 did not depend on the presence of T and B cells. In addition, VNP20009, given intravenously, inhibited the growth of lung metastases in mice. Only live bacteria showed the …

David Bermudes|Do prokaryotes contain microtubules?|David Bermudes, Gregory Hinkle, Lynn Margulis|1994/9/1|Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.|58|3|387-400|American Society for Microbiology|In eukaryotic cells, microtubules are 24-nm-diameter tubular structures composed of a class of conserved proteins called tubulin. They are involved in numerous cell functions including ciliary motility, nerve cell elongation, pigment migration, centrosome formation, and chromosome movement. Although cytoplasmic tubules and fibers have been observed in bacteria, some with diameters similar to those of eukaryotes, no homologies to eukaryotic microtubules have been established. Certain groups of bacteria including azotobacters, cyanobacteria, enteric bacteria, and spirochetes have been frequently observed to possess microtubule-like structures, and others, including archaebacteria, have been shown to be sensitive to drugs that inhibit the polymerization of microtubules. Although little biochemical or molecular biological information is available, the differences observed among these prokaryotic structures …

We investigated whether the efficacy of this combination could be improved by controlling drug ratios following in vivo administration. Irinotecan and cisplatin combinations were evaluated systematically for drug ratio–dependent synergy in vitro using a panel of 20 tumor cell lines. In vitro screening informatics on drug ratio–dependent cytotoxicity identified a consistently antagonistic region between irinotecan/cisplatin molar ratios of 1:2 to 4:1, which was bordered by two synergistic regions. Liposomal co-formulations of these two agents were developed that exhibited plasma drug half-lives of ∼6 hours and maintained a fixed drug ratio for more than 24 hours. Drug ratio–dependent antitumor activity was shown in vivo for these liposome formulations, and irinotecan … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-Targeted Salmonella|David Bermudes, Brooks Low, John Pawelek|2002||||57-63|Springer, Boston, MA|Genetically engineered Salmonella offer an intriguing new approach to selectively target solid tumors, including melanoma, lung, colon, breast, kidney and liver. These bacteria target tumors after systemic administration and selectively replicate within them. Specificity for tumors is often more than 1,000 times greater than for any other tissue. Auxotrophic mutations make these bacteria highly safe and form the basis for maintaining tumor specificity. An altered lipid greatly reduces the potential for septic shock yet also retains the antitumor properties of these bacteria. These bacteria have innate antitumor activity towards both primary and metastatic tumors and the ability to deliver proteins capable of activating chemotherapeutic agents directly within tumors. The delay in tumor growth results in mice that survive up to twice as long. These bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, allowing external … 
David Bermudes|Antitumour effects of genetically engineered Salmonella in combination with radiation|J Platt, S Sodi, M Kelley, S Rockwell, D Bermudes, KB Low, J Pawelek|2000/12/1|European Journal of Cancer|36|18|2397-2402|Pergamon|The antitumour efficacy of lipid A mutant Salmonella was evaluated alone and in combination with X-rays in mice bearing B16F10 or Cloudman S91 melanomas. Each treatment alone slowed tumour growth and prolonged survival, and the combined treatments produced supra-additive antitumour effects. That is, in dose–response studies with single doses of Salmonella and increasing doses of radiation, the two agents together caused suppression of tumour growth that was greater than that calculated for additivity. The results suggest that the combination of these genetically engineered Salmonella with radiotherapy could be a new and beneficial treatment for solid tumours.

A bone marrow-engrafting CCRF-CEM leukemia model in Rag2-M mice was utilized to correlate the therapeutic and myelosuppressive properties of CPX-351 with bone marrow delivery and drug uptake in leukemia cells relative to normal bone marrow cell populations. When administered to mice bearing CCRF-CEM human leukemia xenografts, CPX-351 ablated bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells to below detectable levels for multiple weeks, whereas the free-drug cocktail only transiently suppressed leukemia growth. In contrast to the activity against leukemia cells, CPX-351 and free-drug cocktail induced similar myelosuppression in non-tumor-bearing BM …

Benzing, David H., Givnish, T.J. and Bermudes|1985|Systematic Botany|10|1|81-91||Brocchinia reducta, a tank-forming member of subfamily Pitcairnioideae (Bromeliaceae), possesses foliar trichomes capable of absorbing 3H-leucine as do those borne by other members of the same family (all Tillandsioideae and some species of Bromelioideae). In general, pitcairnioid trichomes have been considered incapable of participating in nutrient uptake. Other features of leaf anatomy and physiology, such as the presence of the C3 photosynthetic pathway, suggest that either 1) Brocchinia and tillandsioid tank shoots bearing absorptive hairs are a result of convergence or 2) both subfamilies acquired this feature from the same ancestor. All in all, Tillandsioideae and Pitcairnioideae share more vegetative features in common than either does with Bromelioideae and, thus, may be more closely related than was previously suspected. Tank deployment in Bromelioideae seems to have originated independently …

Following invasion and exocytosis of dense granules within the parasitophorous vacuole, GRA3 becomes associated with the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and extensions of the PVM which protrude into the cytoplasm. A partial cDNA encoding GRA3 was isolated from a Toxoplasma gondii expression library using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the mature GRA3 protein of tachyzoites. Antibodies affinity purified using the cloned fusion protein reacted with a 30-kDa band on immunoblots and recognized dense granules, the PVM, and PVM extensions by immunofluorescence staining of infected cells. Northern blot analysis indicated the major transcript was of a slightly larger size, and the complete cDNA encoding GRA3 was subsequently obtained. Southern blot analysis suggests that GRA3 is present as a …

The protein has apyrase activity, degrading ATP to the di- and mono-phosphate forms. Because T. gondii is incapable of de novo synthesis of purines, it is postulated that NTPase may be used by the parasite to salvage purines from the host cell for survival and replication. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of NTP gene expression, we isolated from the virulent RH strain of T. gondii the putative promoter region of three tandemly repeated NTP genes (NTP1, 2, 3). Using deletion constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, we defined an active promoter within the first 220 bp. Sequence analysis of this region reveals the lack of a TATA box, but the promoter region is associated with a sequence which resembles an initiator element (Inr) in the NTP1 and …

All anaerobic respiratory functions were restored by complementation of the mutants with specific cloned DNA fragments. Southern hybridization experiments revealed that the fragment that complements the MR-1 mutant was localized on the megaplasmids of both strains, while the fragment that complements the sp200 mutant was chromosomal. Neither of these fragments hybridized with the anaerobic regulatory genes of S. putrefaciens (etrA) or E. coli (fnr).

The culture was non-luminous growing submerged in defined liquid media with or without agitation. After a two- to three-day lag period on solid substrata, luminescence increased exponentially with a doubling time of 4 hours while the increase in colony radial growth was linear. On solid substrata, growth and total light emission were strongly correlated under most conditions studied. Optimal conditions included darkness; 28 C; pH 3.8; glucose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose or pectin as carbon source; and ammonia or asparagine as nitrogen source. Growth and luminescence were inhibited by ambient fluorescent light. Dark-grown colonies were brightest in the center while light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery …

A mutation that functions to constitutively activate pmrA [pmrA(Con)] suppresses msbB growth defects on EGTA-containing media. Lipid A structural analysis showed that Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains, compared to Salmonella msbB strains, have increased amounts of palmitate and phosphoethanolamine but no aminoarabinose addition, suggesting that aminoarabinose is not incorporated into msbB lipid A. Surprisingly, loss-of-function mutations in the aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes restored EGTA and polymyxin sensitivity to Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains. These blocks in aminoarabinose biosynthesis also prevented lipid A phosphoethanolamine incorporation and reduced the levels of palmitate addition …

An attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, called VNP20009, and its derivative TAPET-CD (which expresses Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase) are highly selective for tumor tissue and can deliver therapeutic proteins preferentially to tumors in preclinical models. Both VNP20009 and TAPET-CD have been investigated successfully in Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer patients.

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer-specific molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anti-cancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer... specific targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufficiently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce significant therapeutic effects. Recent findings suggest that the pathogenic bacteriumSallnonella, when genetically modified, can be used to …

Luminescence, varying among species, occurs in either the basidiocarp, the mycelium, the spores, or in combinations thereof (see O'Kane et al., 1990). Photometers have long been used to study bioluminescence (see Reynolds, 1972); however, perception ofluminescence in fungi has been largely by eye and/or documented photographically. Use of photometric measurements has generally been restricted to physiological studies of common species and examinations of the possible occurrence of bioluminescence in species suggested to be luminous (eg, Bermudes et al., 1990). Knowledge of the distribution of fungal luminescence, therefore, has been generally restricted by the detection limits of the human eye. Bioluminescence in fungi ranges …

David Bermudes|Symbiont acquisition as neoseme: origin of species and higher taxa.|D Bermudes, L Margulis|1987|Symbiosis (Philadelphia, Pa.)|4||185-198||We examine the hypothesis that, in the origin of species and higher taxa of eukaryotes, symbiont acquisition followed by partner integration has been equivalent to neoseme appearance leading to speciation. The formation of stable symbiotic associations involves partner-surface recognition, behavioral and metabolic interaction, and, in some cases, gene product (RNA, protein) and genic (RNA, DNA) integration. This analysis is applied here to examples of neosemes that define specific taxa and to neosemes in plants, fungi, and animals that involve the appearance of new types of tissue. If this hypothesis is correct--if the origin of major genetic variation leading to speciation and even higher taxa may occur through symbiont acquisition and integration--then the analysis of" origins of species and higher taxa" becomes analogous to the study of microbial community ecology.

It is hypothesized that mice would be more susceptible than other animal species to the toxic effects of VNP20009, because mice are the most sensitive natural host for the parental wild-type Salmonella typhimurium strain. These studies also compared the virulence of VNP20009 and the parental Salmonella in mice. In Cynomolgus monkeys and Yorkshire pigs (n = 2/dose), various doses (expressed as colony forming units [cfu] per animal) of VNP20009, or vehicle, were administered as a single IV injection (∼ 1 ml/min). The body weight, body temperature, clinical signs, clinical pathology (serum chemistry and hematology), and ophthalmic examinations (only in monkeys) were evaluated at various times.

David Bermudes|Intercontinental compatibility in Panellus stypticus with a note on bioluminescence|Ronald H Petersen, David Bermudes|1992|Persoonia-Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution of Fungi|14|4|457-463||Single-spore and polyspore cultures of Panellus stypticus from Japan were non-luminescent, while single-spore isolates from Illinois comprised both luminescent and nonluminescent strains. Luminous single-spore isolates exhibited varying levels of luminescence, and in some single-spore isolates, a delay in the onset of luminescence was observed. Japanese and eastern North American collections were universally sexually compatible, and thus belong to the same biological species. Nuclear migration beyond the contact zone between crossed single-spore strains was only occasionally observed, and was consistently accompanied by hyphal lysis of the receptor strain. Production of nuclei fit for nuclear migration appeared strain-specific, and not related to mating type genes.

Although the formulation demonstrated enhanced cisplatin tumor accumulation in preclinical models it did not enhance clinical efficacy, possibly due to limited cisplatin release from the formulation localized within the tumor. We have examined a series of liposomal formulations to address the in vivo relationship between cisplatin release rate and formulation efficacy in the P388 murine leukemia model. The base formulation of phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylglycerol: cholesterol was altered in the C18 and C16 phospholipid content to influence membrane fluidity and thereby impacting drug circulation lifetime and drug retention. Phase transition temperatures (Tm) ranged from 42–55°C. The high Tm formulations demonstrated enhanced drug retention properties accompanied by low antitumor activity while the lowest Tm formulations released the drug too rapidly in the plasma, limiting drug delivery to the tumor which also resulted in low antitumor activity. A formulation composed of DSPC : DPPC : DSPG : Chol; (35 : 35 : 20 : 10) with an intermediate drug release rate and a cisplatin plasma half-life of 8.3 hours showed the greatest antitumor activity. This manuscript highlights the critical role that drug release rates play in the design of an optimized drug delivery vehicle.

Long, hollow structures each comgosed of 13 protofilaments as revealed by electron microscopy, microtubules (240 A in diameter) are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes. These proteins have been the subject of intense biochemical and biophysical interest since the early 1970~’~ and are of evolutionary interest as well (eg, References 27 and 29). If tubulin-based structures (ie, neurotubules, mitotic spindle tubules, centrioles, kinetosomes, axonemes, etc.) evolved from spirochetes by way of motility symbioses, tubulin homologies with spirochete proteins should be detectable (see Reference 4). Tubulin proteins are widely thought to be limited to eukaryotes (eg, Reference 36). Yet both azotobacters’ and have shown immunological crossreactivity with antitubulin antibodies.

David Bermudes|Tumor-Targeted Salmonella: Strain Development and Expression of the HSV-tK Effector Gene|David Bermudes, Brooks Low, John M Pawelek|2000||||419-436|Humana Press|Gene therapy approaches to cancer treatment have been limited by the ability of the delivery vectors to achieve specific high-level expression within tumor cells or the tumor environment following systemic administration. Numerous physical barriers exist in the delivery of therapeutic agents (including drugs, viruses, and liposomes) to solid tumors that can compromise the effectiveness (1), thus stimulating the search for alternative methods of delivery. Whereas it has been known for some time that spores of anaerobic Clostridium can germinate within the necrotic spaces of human tumors, they are limited to larger hypoxic tumors and are inaccessible to smaller metastases (2,3). The ability of motile, facultatively anaerobic Salmonella to target tumors following systemic administration, preferentially amplify within them, and express effector genes such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO 2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|Verena Karsten, Sean R Murray, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2009/12|BMC microbiology|9|1|170|BioMed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high osmolarity …

MsbB− salmonellae mutate extragenically to EGTA-tolerant derivatives at a frequency of 10−4 per division. One of these derivatives arose from inactivation of somA, which suppresses sensitivity to salt and EGTA. Here we show that a second mode of MsbB− suppression is a RecA-dependent deletion between two IS200 insertion elements present in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 but not in two other wild-type strains, LT2 and SL1344, which lack one of the IS200 elements. This deletion occurs spontaneously in wild-type and MsbB− strain 14028 salmonellae and accounts for about one-third of all of the spontaneous …

Continued use of these bromeliads and other Florida vascular epiphytes for air quality surveillance is recommended. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis inferred from the fossil record|David Bermudes, Richard C Back|1991|Margulis and Fester|||72-91||Fossil assemblages are notorious for their many biases. Notably, hard parts are more likely to be preserved than soft ones. The fossil record is largely a history of these hard parts from which past biology must be inferred. There is little direct evidence of symbiosis in the fossil record. Most microbial symbionts do not preserve well, and thus a host and a symbiont are seldom preserved together. Notable exceptions are the fungus-root associations found in Rhynie cherts dating to 400 million years ago (Kidston and Lang 1921; Boullard and Lemoigne 1971). These associations are sometimes interpreted as mutualistic mycorrhizae (Pirozynski and Malloch 1975; Malloch et al. 1980; Pirozynski and Dalpe 1989), although problems remain with interpretations of biological relationships based purely on morphology. Co-preservation insufficiently resolves the question of the influence of a biological relationship, and thus additional information must be sought. Actualistic assumptions have been applied to ecology (Mayr 1963) and genetics (Dobzhansky 1951) for the interpretation of the fossil record and, we believe, should be further extended to incorporate symbiosis. The field of symbiosis has long been a contributor to the understanding of biology (De Bary 1879; Mereschkovskii 1910; Wallin 1927), yet symbiosis remains largely peripheral to contemporary evolutionary theory. Several papers have already discussed the influence of symbiosis on evolutionary history (Taylor 1979, 1983; Cowen 1983; Margulis and Bermudes 1985; Bermudes and Margulis 1987). The purpose of this paper is to identify different ways in which symbiosis may have influenced …

We report here the development of nanoparticle delivery systems for hydrophobic drugs where plasma drug levels can be controlled in a manner that can be readily adapted to deliver drug combinations. Paclitaxel is a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug that is typically used in combination with other agents to treat breast, lung and ovarian cancer.

Yet, most late-stage cancers are either insensitive to the therapies to begin with or develop resistance later. Therapy with live tumour-targeting bacteria provides a unique option to meet these challenges. Compared with most other therapeutics, the effectiveness of tumour-targeting bacteria is not directly affected by the ‘genetic makeup’of a tumour. Bacteria initiate their direct antitumour effects from deep within the tumour, followed by innate and adaptive antitumour immune responses. As microscopic ‘robotic factories’, bacterial vectors can be reprogrammed following simple genetic rules or sophisticated synthetic bioengineering principles to produce and deliver anticancer agents on the basis of clinical needs.

These Salmonella have the ability to locally induce apoptosis when they are in direct contact with cancer cells but they lack significant bystander killing, which may correlate with their overall lack of antitumor activity in human clinical studies. In order to compensate for this deficiency without enhancing overall toxicity, we engineered the bacteria to express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐targeted cytotoxic proteins that are released into the extracellular milieu. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of the Salmonella strain VNP20009 to produce three different forms of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ToxA) chimeric with a tumor growth factor alpha (TGFα) which results in its producing culture supernatants that are cytotoxic and induce apoptosis in EGFR positive … 
David Bermudes|A culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors|David Quintero, David Bermudes|2014/5/1|Journal of microbiological methods|100||105-110|Elsevier|We have developed a culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors. The assay utilizes standard proteolysis detection plates to support microbial growth followed by infiltrating the plate with a protease and subsequently detecting the remaining protein by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, or by bromocreosol green (BCG) or Ponseau S (PS) staining. The presence of a protease inhibitor can be observed in the form of a protected zone of protein around the protease inhibitor-producing strain. Using the protease inhibitors α-2-macroglobulin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and bestatin and the primary and secondary forms of Photorhabdus luminescens in combination with the protease trypsin, we were able to demonstrate that the assay is specific for the cognate inhibitor of the protease and for bacteria secreting protease inhibitors.

The vacuolar space and surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) are the interface between the parasite and the host cell. Establishment and maintenance of the vacuole and PVM are dependent on temporally regulated secretion from three different secretory organelles, the rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules. Understanding the process of secretion and the localization and function of secreted parasite proteins provides important insights into the pathogenesis of infections with T. gondii. For this reason, we have been studying the structure and function of the PVM and of secreted parasite proteins in the vacuolar space and membrane. Our initial results showed that the newly formed PVM is fusion incompetent, being incapable of fusing with any vesicular organelle of the host …

The Salmonella strains used, however, must be stably attenuated in order to provide sufficient safety for administration. Approaches to the generation of attenuated Salmonella strains have included deletion of the msbB gene that is responsible for addition of the terminal myristol group to lipid A. In the absence of myristoylation, lipid A is no longer capable of inducing septic shock, resulting in a significant enhancement in safety. However, msbB Salmonella strains also exhibit an unusual set of additional physiological characteristics, including sensitivities to NaCl, EGTA, deoxycholate, polymyxin, and CO2. Suppressor mutations that compensate for these sensitivities include somA, Suwwan, pmrA C , and zwf. We describe here methods for isolation of strains with compensatory …

The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration. TAPET-CD accumulated in tumors at levels 1000-fold higher than that in normal tissues and high levels of 5-FU were detected in tumors in mice treated with both TAPET-CD and 5-FC. No 5-FU could be detected in normal tissues. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with either TAPET-CD alone or TAPET-CD in combination with 5-FC (TAPET-CD/5-FC), but not with 5-FC alone. TAPET-CD/5-FC inhibited tumor growth by 88%-96%, compared to TAPET-CD alone, which inhibited tumor growth by 38%-79%. These data suggest that tumor-targeting Salmonella could be used to deliver prodrug-converting enzyme selectively to tumors and produced anti-tumor effects when the corresponding prodrug was also given.

We initially constructed chimeras of SFTI with N-terminal secretion signals from the Escherichia coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ToxA, but only detected small amounts of protease inhibition resulting from these constructs. A substantially higher degree of protease inhibition was detected from a C-terminal SFTI fusion with E. coli YebF, which radiated more than a centimeter from an individual colony of E. coli using a culturebased inhibitor assay. Inhibitory activity was further improved in YebF-SFTI fusions by the addition of a trypsin cleavage signal immediately upstream of SFTI, and resulted in production of a 14-amino-acid, disulfide-bonded SFTI free in the culture supernatant. To assess the potential of the secreted SFTI to protect the ability of a cytotoxic protein to kill tumor cells, we utilized a tumor-selective form of the Pseudomonas ToxA (OTG-PE38K) alone and expressed as a polycistronic construct with YebF-SFTI in the tumor-targeted Salmonella VNP20009. When we assessed the ability of toxin-containing culture supernatants to kill MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, the untreated OTG-PE38K was able to eliminate all detectable tumor cells, while pretreatment with trypsin resulted in the complete loss of anticancer cytotoxicity. However, when OTG-PE38K was co-expressed with YebF-SFTI, cytotoxicity was completely retained in the presence of trypsin. These data demonstrate SFTI chimeras are secreted in a functional form and that co-expression of protease inhibitors with therapeutic proteins by tumor-targeted bacteria …

This drug ratio consistently displayed synergy in a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro whereas increasing or decreasing the drug ratio lead to decreased synergy and the appearance of antagonism based on median-effect analysis. CPX-1 has demonstrated markedly superior therapeutic activity over the free irinotecan:floxuridine drug cocktails in a range of preclinical solid tumor models and in vivo efficacy was also shown to be drug ratio dependent. Given the prevalent use of biological agents in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic CRC, we examined the effects of combining CPX-1 with BEV or CET in human CRC tumor xenografts with … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|David Bermudes, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, Sean R Murray, Verena Karsten, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy|2009|||||Biomed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high …

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer—speciﬁc molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anticancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer~ speciﬁc targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufﬁciently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce signiﬁcant therapeutic effects.

Tumor volume doubling time, another indicator for tumor growth inhibition, also significantly increased in mice treated with VNP20009. Using mice with immune system deficiencies, we also demonstrated that the antitumor effects of VNP20009 did not depend on the presence ofT and B cells. In addition, VNP20009, given intravenously, inhibited the growth of lung metastases in mice. Only live bacteria showed the antitumor effect.

This selectivity occurred in subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, including Bl6FIO melanoma, M127 lung carcinoma, and colon 38 carcinoma. The preferential accumulation was also manifested in animals bearing human tumor xenografts, including Lox, C8186, DLDl. SW620, HCT l l6. HTB 177, DU145. MDA-MB-231, and Caki. Four to five days after a single IV injection of l x lO' colony-forming unit (cfu)/mouse, we routinely detected VNP20009 proliferation and accumulation at levels ranging from l x 10" to 2 x to'' cfu/g tumor. The amount of VNP20009 accumulated in the liver ranged from 3 x 10' to 2 x 10" cfu/g. The distribution of Salmonella in tumors was homogenous; YS72l2 cnuld he detected from the periphery to the interior portion of the tumors. Using mice with various immunodeficiencies. we also discoverd the same preferential accumulation of Salmonella in tumors implanted in these mice. The use of Salmonella as a protein delivery vector was shown by IV administration of the bacteria expressing either green f1uorescent protein (GFP) or cytosine deaminase (CD) into tumor-bearing mice. GFP and CD were detected in tumors, but not in livers, taken from mice inoculated with Salmonella carrying these genes. Bacteria accumulation and CD expression persisted in the tumors for up to 14 days after a single bolus IV administration of bacteria to tumor- bearing mice.

Several of the models showed improved survival times, but tumors eventually resumed growth, resulting in the death of the animals. The tumor site-related and systemic toxicities reported in preclinical studies of strictly anaerobic bacteria were not observed, although after a prolonged period, some subcutaneous tumors developed a central necrotic region.

Controls included parental S91 melanoma cells, S91 S91 autologous hybrids, and highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells. Cells were implanted s.c. in the tail, and mice were monitored for metastases over 6 months. A striking characteristic of the hybrids was heterogeneity among individual cell lines, with metastases generated in mice ranging from 0- 100% of animals, and basal melanin content from amelanotic to supermelanotic. Heterogeneity was further augmented in vivo in that hybrids stably melanotic after repeated passage in culture occasionally produced amelanotic metastases in mice. With few exceptions, hybrids had elevated basal tyrosinase activity and were much more responsive to MSH compared to parental controls. The most aggressive hybrids were supermelanotic and also markedly more motile than parental cells in vitro. Autologous S91 S91 hybrids were even less metastatic and less motile than parental cells. Histologically, the metastatic hybrids demonstrated vascular invasion and spread to distant organs similar to that of metastatic melanomas in mice and humans. The hybrids resembled natural melanoma metastases so closely that they should serve as useful new models for this complex phenomenon.

In order to better understand this phenomenon, we carried out analyses of 30 separately isolated melanoma/macrophage hybrid lines, focusing on expression of differentiated functions characteristic of macrophages or melanocytes. Findings were as follows. 1) Hybrids contained DNA sequences from both parental lines. 2) Hybrids were supermelanotic and highly responsive to MSH compared to parental Cloudman cells. 3) Hybrids expressed fluoride-sensitive non-specific esterase activity characteristic of monocytes and macrophages. 4) EM studies revealed that the hybrids had melanosomes with organized lattice structures, reminscent of those in normal melanocytes, whereas melanosomes in the parental cells were typically amorphous. 5) Western blotting studies revealed that in many of the hybrids the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, as well as the LAMP-1 protein migrated more slowly on electrophoretic gels than the analagous proteins expressed by parental melanoma cells. Further, LAMP-1 in hybrids migrated at an identical rate to that of macrophage LAMP-1. These differences were consistent with differences in protein glycosylation, as if a macrophage-like protein glycosyltransferase were expressed in the hybrids. In summary, hybrids formed between Cloudman melanoma cells and normal macrophages form highly aggressive tumors in mice, are supermelanotic, have normal appearing … 
David Bermudes|Macrophage characteristics of metastatic melanoma.|John Pawelek, Michael Rachkovsky, Stefano Sodi, Jean Bolognia, Ashok Chakraborty, Jennifer Madison, David Bermudes|1995|Journal of Investigative Dermatology|4|104|605||Since first proposed by Aichel (1911), expression of lymphocytic/monocytic traits has often been suggested as a mechanism for metastasis. Abilities to invade basment membranes and to home to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and distant organs are characteristics shared by lymphocytes, monocytes, and metastatic cancer cells alike. Previous studies showed that in vitro hybridization between normal lymphocytes or monocytes and transformed lymphoid cell lines resulted in increased agressiveness of the hybrid cells in vivo. However, such experiments had not been carried out with cells of solid tumor origin. Accordingly, we isolated clones of hybrids between normal mouse macrophages from DBA/2J mice and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells, using standard cell fusion and HAT selection techniques. Five hybrid clones were examined for their metastatic potential compared to the S91 parental cell line. First, in a Matrigel @ invasion assay, macrophage x melanoma hybrids showed increased abilities to cross an artificial biomatrix compared to S91 parental cells. Further, biomatrix invasion was dramatically increased in the hybrid clones but not in the parental S91 cells following exposure to MSH and IBMX. Second, in two separate experiments parental S91 cells and 5 macrophage x melanoma hybrids were inoculated s.c. into the tails of 20 DBA/2J mice. Mice inoculated with parental S91 cells did not die during the experiment and showed little or no evidence of metastases over 5 months. In contrast, mice inoculated with hybrids began dying of soft tissue and pulmonary metastases within 4-6 weeks (>30% of mice). Histologic sections …

David Bermudes|Microbial contributions to the Precambrian Earth|L Margulis, D Bermudes, R Obar|1986/5/1||||||Life has existed on Earth for approximately 3.5 billion years. For most of this time, prokaryotic communities provided the major biological forces changing the Earth. Many changes in atmospheric gas composition occurred during the Archean and Proterozoic eons as a result of microbial activity. Extant microbial communities were used to help understand the dynamics which contributed to these atmospheric changes. The microbial mat communities were characterized according to the organismic constituents. Symbiosis in microbial communities is recognized as a major force in cell evolution. Among the evolutinary enigmas investigated is the problem of the origin of the undulipodia. Undulipodial microtubules are still deployed for major cellular processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Several prokaryotes were tested for the presence of the S1-type protein, so far only spirochetes were found to possess it. The S1-type protein is being sought in cyanobacteria reported to contain microtubules.

Results of light and dark studies under normal and reduced oxygen tensions were compared to determine the effect of reduction in oxygen tension on glutathione levels. The growth rate of Anacystis nidulans and concurrent production of glutathione is presented. The generation of time of Anacystis nidulans was approximately 12 hours. Results of light and dark incubation of Aphanothece halophytica dominated planktonic microbial community from Pond 4 and Anacystis nidulans under high and low oxygen tension is also presented. It appears that light grown Anacystis nidulans cells have equal amounts of glutathione while dark grown cells produce more glutathione in the presence of increased O2.

Enzyme Reg. 22: 27-55) based on molar drug ratios. CI screening a human tumor cell line panel results in a fixed-ratio matrix “heat map” shown for drug concentrations resulting in an 80% fraction of cells affected (ED= 80). Green (CI< 1), synergy; yellow (CI~ 1), additivity; red (CI> 1), antagonism. Plasma levels of irinotecan and cisplatin were determined at five time points after iv administration in female CD-1 nude mice. A. Following injection of CPX-571 at an irinotecan dose of 60 μmoles/kg (41 mg/kg) and a cisplatin dose of 8.6 μmoles/kg (2.6 mg/kg), mouse plasma was isolated at the indicated times and assayed for irinotecan (●) and cisplatin (○) by HPLC. B. Based on the plasma drug levels, the molar ratio of irinotecan: cisplatin was calculated for each time point. All data points represent the mean values obtained from three mice per time point, and the error bars represent the SE. 
Robert Espinoza|Climate change mitigation: A spatial analysis of global land suitability for clean development mechanism afforestation and reforestation|Robert J Zomer, Antonio Trabucco, Deborah A Bossio, Louis V Verchot|2008/6/1|Agriculture, ecosystems & environment|126|1-2|67-80|Elsevier|Within the Kyoto Protocol, the clean development mechanism (CDM) is an instrument intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development, with the multiple goals of poverty reduction, environmental benefits and cost-effective emission reductions. The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was …

Robert Espinoza|Recurrent evolution of herbivory in small, cold-climate lizards: breaking the ecophysiological rules of reptilian herbivory|Robert E Espinoza, John J Wiens, C Richard Tracy|2004/11/30|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|101|48|16819-16824|National Academy of Sciences|Herbivory has evolved in many groups of vertebrates, but it is rare among both extinct and extant nonavian reptiles. Among squamate reptiles, (lizards, snakes, and their relatives), <2% of the >7,800 species are considered to be herbivorous, and herbivory is restricted to lizards. Here, we show that within a group of South American lizards (Liolaemidae, ≈170 species), herbivory has evolved more frequently than in all other squamates combined and at a rate estimated to be >65 times faster. Furthermore, in contrast to other herbivorous lizards and to existing theory, most herbivorous liolaemids are small bodied and live in cool climates. Herbivory is generally thought to evolve only in reptile species that are large bodied, live in warm climates, and maintain high body temperatures. These three well known “rules” of herbivory are considered to form the bases of physiological constraints that explain the paucity of …

Liolaemus species form two well-supported monophyletic groups of subgeneric status, Liolaemus and Eulaemus. These subgenera appear to have separated at least 12.6 million years ago based on the amount of molecular evolutionary divergence between them. Hypotheses that species occurring in the Andes, west of the Andes, and east of the Andes, each comprise distinct monophyletic groups are independently rejected statistically. The shortest estimate of phylogeny suggests mat Liolaemus originated either in the … 
Robert Espinoza|The importance of phylogenetic scale in tests of Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules: lessons from a clade of South American lizards|FB Cruz, LA Fitzgerald, RE Espinoza, JA Schulte Ii|2005/11|Journal of Evolutionary Biology|18|6|1559-1574|Blackwell Science Ltd|We tested for the occurrence of Bergmann's rule, the pattern of increasing body size with latitude, and Rapoport's rule, the positive relationship between geographical range size and latitude, in 34 lineages of Liolaemus lizards that occupy arid regions of the Andean foothills. We tested the climatic‐variability hypothesis (CVH) by examining the relationship between thermal tolerance breadth and distribution. Each of these analyses was performed varying the level of phylogenetic inclusiveness. Bergmann's rule and the CVH were supported, but Rapoport's rule was not. More variance in the data for Bergmann's rule and the CVH was explained using species belonging to the L. boulengeri series rather than all species, and inclusion of multiple outgroups tended to obscure these macroecological patterns. Evidence for Bergmann's rule and the predicted patterns from the CVH remained after application of phylogenetic … 
Robert Espinoza|Methods in comparative phylogeography, and their application to studying evolution in the North American aridlands|Robert M Zink|2002/11/1|Integrative and Comparative Biology|42|5|953-959|Oxford University Press|Historical biogeography and comparative phylogeography have much in common. Both seek to discover common historical patterns in the elements of biotas, although typically at different tiers of evolutionary history. Comparative phylogeography is based on phylogeographic analyses of multiple taxa, usually widespread species. By comparing the phylogeographic structures of numerous widespread sympatric species, one can infer whether the current fauna has been historically stable, as evidenced by the relative frequency of geographically congruent reciprocally monophyletic groups. Alternatively, if species distributions are ephemeral over evolutionary time, a mixture of phylogeographic structures is expected. Coalescence analyses contribute information about history irrespective of whether haplotype phylogenies are structured or not. In the aridlands of North America, several isolating events are evident … 
Robert Espinoza|A critical review and systematic discussion of recent classification proposals for liolaemid lizards|Fernando Lobo, Robert E Espinoza, Sebastian Quinteros|2010/7/26|Zootaxa|2549|1|1-30||We provide a critical review of a recent taxonomic revision of Chilean Liolaemus lizards (Iguania: Liolaemidae) by Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) and a recent paper (PincheiraDonoso et al. 2008), which proposed several new taxonomic and phylogenetic arrangements. We document fundamental problems with many of the proposed taxonomic revisions in both publications, which if followed, could lead to serious taxonomic confusion. In Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) a subgeneric classification is erected, which was produced by outdated methods (phenetic analyses), cannot be replicated (no matrix is presented), and is taxonomically untenable (some of the subgenera are nested within other subgenera). Most of the taxonomic groups that are proposed have been previously proposed, albeit differently constituted, yet often previous research is not given attribution; when findings are different, the research of others is either overlooked or dismissed without comment. The diagnoses of species and subspecies (including several newly proposed taxa) are often written in an authoritative manner (without supporting data or information), making them insufficient for distinguishing the focal taxon from others belonging to the same group, finally leading to uncertainty regarding the validity of several of the newly proposed taxa, combinations, or synonymies. We also describe less egregious errors of omission and commission. In Pincheira-Donoso et al.(2008), most of the proposals follow the Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) revisions, some species are allocated to groups without consistent cladistic support and other proposed relationships …

Recently, a few populations of L. alticolor from northwestern Argentina were reported to be reproductively bimodal-having both oviparous and viviparous females at the same locality. We reexamined lizards from these putatively bimodal populations and found evidence that these populations include two sympatric yet distinct species-one oviparous, the other viviparous. These species can also be distinguished from L. alticolor sensu stricto from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia). Here we describe the two new species, L. ramirezae and L. pagaburoi, from the province of Tucumán, Argentina. Liolaemus ramirezae differs from L. alticolor in having distinct neck folds, precloacal pores in females …

The desert tortoise was listed under the Endangered Species Act largely due to a newly recognized upper respiratory disease thought to cause mortality in individuals and severe declines in populations. Numerous hypotheses about the threats to the persistence of desert tortoise populations involve acquisition of nutrients, and its connection to stress and disease. The nutritional wisdom hypothesis posits that animals should forage not for particular food items, but instead, for particular nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus used in building bones. The optimal foraging hypothesis suggests that, in circumstances of resource abundance, tortoises should forage as dietary …

The new species were previously considered conspecific with either Liolaemus walkeri in northeastern Chile or L. alticolor in northwestern Argentina and adjacent Chile. However, the new species differ from these taxa, and all other members of the alticolor group, in a number of characteristics. Liolaemus chaltin n. sp. differs from L. alticolor from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia) in the following ways: this new species has a larger body size; a fragmented vertebral stripe; and a pigmented subocular (white in L. alticolor), and is one of just three members of the alticolor group that is oviparous. Liolaemus puna n. sp. differs from all other members of the alticolor group in that male L. puna lack paravertebral markings and dorsolateral and vertebral stripes. Females …

Robert Espinoza|Herbivory imposes constraints on voluntary hypothermia in lizards|C Richard Tracy, Kevin M Flack, Linda C Zimmerman, Robert E Espinoza, Christopher R Tracy|2005/2|Copeia|2005|1|12-19||Animals that are unable to meet their metabolic needs should adopt compensatory behaviors to mitigate their energetic deficits. Voluntary hypothermia is one such energy-saving strategy. Physiological constraints associated with the digestion of plant tissues, however, may limit the thermoregulatory options of herbivorous ectotherms. In this laboratory study, selected body temperatures of Desert Iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), subjected to two different rations of a carnivorous and a herbivorous diet, were measured in a laboratory thermal gradient. Lizards fed a carnivorous diet and rationed to 50% of their daily energetic requirement selected significantly lower body temperatures than did lizards in the other diet/ration treatments. Lizards fed a herbivorous diet selected higher body temperatures than did the same lizards fed a carnivorous diet regardless of ration. Our study indicates that selected …

Robert Espinoza|Physiological benefits as precursors of sociality: why banded geckos band|Jennifer R Lancaster, Paul Wilson, Robert E Espinoza|2006/7/1|Animal Behaviour|72|1|199-207|Academic Press|Aggregating has been widely studied in a variety of animals and found to have important benefits in terms of sociality, courtship, predator avoidance and physiology. Several species of nocturnal geckos form diurnal aggregations; however, little is known about the benefits of these groupings. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the benefit of aggregation for the desert-dwelling western banded gecko, Coleonyx variegatus. We found that banded geckos benefit from aggregation by a reduction in evaporative water loss (EWL). No social or mating benefits were detected, and geckos did not group to avoid predators. Geckos did not select diurnal retreat sites based solely on the scent of conspecifics, although they aggregated readily when conspecifics were present. Thus, C. variegatus appear to achieve physiological but not social benefits from grouping. Banded geckos belong to an ancestrally tropical …

Proximity to water and similarity in body size between aggregating and solitary toads suggest that grouping is not imposed by a need for reducing evaporative water loss. Aggregation apparently provides thermal benefits, which should translate into faster growth. 
Robert Espinoza|Responses to prey and plant chemicals by three iguanian lizards: relationship to plants in the diet|Robert Espinoza, Jason Habegger, William Cooper|2001/1/1|Amphibia-Reptilia|22|3|349-361|Brill|We examined responses of three iguanian lizards, the phrynosomatid Sceloporus poinsettii and the tropidurids Tropidurus hispidus and Phymaturus punae, to prey chemicals and plant chemicals. When chemical stimuli were presented on cotton swabs or on ceramic tiles, neither S. poinsettii nor T. hispidus discriminated among prey, plant, and control stimuli. In contrast, an individual of P. punae discriminated both prey and plant chemicals from control stimuli in swab tests, typically biting swabs bearing prey or plant cues. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plant chemical discrimination evolves in herbivorous iguanians such as P. punae. Sceloporus poinsettii, which appears to be entirely insectivorous at some times, but eats substantial quantities of flowers at others, did not discriminate among the stimuli. Because all previously tested herbivores and omnivores responded strongly to prey and … 
Robert Espinoza|Diet quality does not affect resting metabolic rate or body temperatures selected by an herbivorous lizard|KE Nussear, RE Espinoza, CM Gubbins, KJ Field, JP Hayes|1998/4/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology B|168|3|183-189|Springer-Verlag|Diet quality can influence many aspects of digestion, but the links between diet quality and resting metabolism are poorly understood. In nature, it might be beneficial to reduce energy expenditure when only poor quality diets are available. Alternatively, animals might increase the processing capacity of the gut to more thoroughly extract energy. If maintaining the processing capacity of the gut is energetically expensive, then increasing gut size or function might result in higher resting metabolism. In ectotherms, most digestive functions are temperature dependent, thus another strategy to maintain energy balance might be to alter selected body temperatures. We tested whether differing concentrations of dietary fiber affected the resting metabolic rate or body temperatures selected by chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus) – lizards that naturally experience marked variation in dietary fiber. Resting metabolic rates … 
Robert Espinoza|Lizards on ice: Comparative thermal tolerances of the world's southernmost gecko|Denita M Weeks, Robert E Espinoza|2013/7/1|Journal of Thermal Biology|38|5|225-232|Pergamon|(1) We measured thermal tolerances (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and panting threshold, Tpant) for four populations of Homonota darwinii spanning most of the latitudinal range of the species. (2) CTmin differed across populations, but not latitudinally as predicted, likely because latitude was not as good a proxy for operative temperatures (Te). (3) Some populations had subzero CTmin indicating supercooling or freeze tolerance—the first time either phenomenon has been reported for a gecko. (4) Tpant did not differ significantly among populations. (5) The thermal tolerance breadth appears to be correlated with thermal variability in the environment. (6) Annual Te data indicate gecko retreats play a crucial role in surviving extreme surface temperatures (<0 or >50 °C).

Institutional challenges to field studies include decreasing financial resources and increasing regulatory concerns. These are coupled with changing student interests, in particular the growing misconception that field study is not relevant to many biological careers. Collectively, these factors contribute to a significant decline in field-study opportunities for students and lack of pedagogical guidance for instructors interested in conducting field courses. Nature and culture are inextricably linked, and we all benefit from including diverse backgrounds and perspectives in field experiences. We suggest expanding the definition of “the field” to include human-influenced ecosystems, as well as more … 
Robert Espinoza|Herbivory in Liolaemus poecilochromus, a small, cold-climate lizard from the Andes of Argentina|María Soledad Valdecantos, Federico Arias, Robert E Espinoza|2012/6/27|Copeia|2012|2|203-210|The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists|Herbivory is generally thought to be restricted to reptiles with large body sizes that live in warm climates. We show that Liolaemus poecilochromus is primarily herbivorous (>80% plants in diet) even as juveniles, making them the smallest herbivorous reptile known. We detected relatively few differences in diet between the sexes, despite male-biased sexual dimorphism in head and body size. Adults consumed more mites and flowers than juveniles, and we detected a weak ontogenetic shift from omnivory to herbivory that is attributable to the lower volumetric consumption of plants by juvenile males. We discuss the abiotic and biotic conditions that likely selected for herbivory in this and other small-bodied, high-elevation Liolaemus. 
Robert Espinoza|The First Parthenogenetic Pleurodont Iguanian: A New All-female Liolaemus (Squamata: Liolaemidae) from Western Argentina|Cristián S Abdala, Diego Baldo, Ricardo A Juárez, Robert E Espinoza|2016/6/10|Copeia|104|2|487-497|The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists|Vertebrate taxa with entirely unisexual populations are composed of females that reproduce without fertilization and are generally of hybrid origin. At least 23 vertebrate families have unisexual lineages. Within squamate reptiles, >40 uniparental species have been described from five major lineages: acrodont iguanians, Gekkota, Serpentes, Scincomorpha, and Varanidae. Pleurodont iguanians include >1100 species, all of which have gonochoristic reproduction. Here we report the discovery of a new unisexual lizard from the liolaemid genus Liolaemus, a species-rich (∼260 species) clade distributed over most of southern South American. The new species, Liolaemus parthenos, is the only known all-female triploid pleurodont iguanian. The structural chromosome heteromorphisms of the karyotypes support the hypothesis that L. parthenos is the product of a hybrid origin. Based on morphology, the new species is … 
Robert Espinoza|A new Cyrtodactylus Gray, 1827 (Squamata, Gekkonidae) from the Shan Hills and the biogeography of Bent-toed Geckos from eastern Myanmar.|L Lee Grismer, PLJ Wood, Myint Kyaw Thura, Evan SH Quah, Marta S Grismer, Matthew L Murdoch, Robert E Espinoza, Aung Lin|2018/7|Zootaxa|4446|4|477-500||A phylogenetic taxonomic analysis indicates that a newly discovered population of Cyrtodactylus from the vicinity of Ywangan Town in the Shan Hills, Shan State, Myanmar is a new species (C. ywanganensis sp. nov.) and the earliest diverging member of the linnwayensis group within the previously defined Indochinese clade. The DIVALIKE+ J model of a BioGeoBEARS biogeographic analysis indicates that the Indochinese clade evolved in the Shan Hills and Salween Basin of eastern Myanmar and dispersed into Indochina on at least three separate occasions from 18.6-13.4 mya. Once there, uplift of the Tenasserim Mountains and Thai Highlands created the intermedius group, the oldhami group, and C. tigroides of western and southern Thailand which form sister lineages to the linnwayensis group, yathepyanensis group, and the sinyineensis group, respectively, of eastern Myanmar. Diverging lineages within the Indochinese clade highlight the importance of the Thai Highlands and Tenasserim Mountains in that group's evolution and speciation. The discovery of C. ywanganensis sp. nov. in karstic habitats in the Shan Hills continues to underscore the unrealized karst-associated herpetological diversity of this vast, relatively unexplored, upland region and the need for additional field studies.

Robert Espinoza|Body size, temperature, and the evolution of herbivory in reptiles.|Robert E Espinoza|2003||||4438-4438||I critically review the literature on the biology of Recent herbivorous reptiles to explain why it so few herbivorous reptiles have evolved (<1% of >8000 living species) and to identify the conditions that favor the evolution of herbivory. Despite their divergent evolutionary histories, most herbivorous reptiles live in warm climates, and have converged on a common suite of morphological, physiological, and life-history characteristics. Herbivory appears to evolve from omnivory, primarily in seasonal climates, and possibly results from an energetic deficit caused by switching between an herbivorous and a carnivorous diet. The mechanistic basis of this cost is hypothesized to be the consequence of changes in the community structure of fermentative endosymbionts that are responsible for digesting plant fiber and releasing energy and nutrients into their host''s gut. Most aspects of the biology of herbivorous reptiles have been poorly studied. Liolaemid lizards …

Newly collected samples from the type locality of C. peguensis and other localities indicate that this clade is endemic to central Myanmar and contains at least seven species, four of which are undescribed. Three species, including C. peguensis occur in the low hills of the Bago Yoma Range within the central portion of the Ayeyarwady Basin. Two of these, C. myintkyawthurai sp. nov. from the northern and central Bago Yoma and C. meersi sp. nov. which is syntopic with C. peguensis in the southern Bago Yoma are described herein. As more lowland hilly areas bordering, and within the Ayeyarwady Basin are surveyed, more new species of this group are likely to be discovered. These discoveries continue the recent surge of descriptions of new species of Cyrtodactylus that are being discovered in Myanmar. 
Robert Espinoza|Description of the female of the enigmatic lizard, Liolaemus heliodermis (Iguania: Liolaemidae)|RAYMOND A Hernandez, Robert E Espinoza|2004/9/1|Herpetological Review|35|3|227-228|Lawrence, Kan.: Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, 1967-|The lizard genus Liolaemus has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. In the past decade an average of four new species has been described each year and dozens more await description (Etheridge and Espinoza 2000). Given this trend, and recent estimates of cryptic diversity in some clades (eg, Lobo and Espinoza 1999; Morando et al. 2003), Liolaemus may someday surpass even Anolis (sensu lato) in species richness. Currently, Liolaemus includes approximately 160 species. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis (Schulte et al. 2000) of 60 species representing all major Liolaemus lineages recovered two similarly sized clades and corroborated the results of several morphological studies (reviewed by Etheridge 1995). One of these major clades, the chiliensis group, includes approximately 80 species and has been further divided into numerous subgroups (Etheridge 1995; Lobo 2001). One of these subgroups, the elongatus-kriegi group (sensu Morando et al. 2003; see also Cei 1979), has experienced recent growth with the addition of seven species since 2000 (Avila et al. 2003, 2004; Cei and Videla 2003; Espinoza et al. 2000; Espinoza and Lobo 2003). Moreover, molecular analyses of populations in southern Argentina suggest that the elongatus-kriegi group may include as many as three times the number of species currently recognized (Morando et al. 2003). Given their recent discovery and remarkable diversity, the natural and life history of most species belonging to this group is poorly understood. Among members of the elongatus-kriegi group, L. heliodermis is likely the most enigmatic. This species belongs to a …

Tylototriton ngarsuensis sp. nov. differs from other closely related species of Tylototriton on basis of varying combinations of characteristics associated with it shorter head, larger size, rib nodule morphology, and overall drab, very dark, coloration, along with its genetic differentiation. Tylototriton ngarsuensis sp. nov. also appears to breed later in the year than most other species. Unfortunately, this species like many other Asian newts, is being harvested for the pet and medicinal trade and given its restricted distribution, this could pose a serious threat to its long-term survival.

We show that the evidence does not support Núñez's (2004) proposal. We first document the complex taxonomic history of L. p. major, the lack of a precise or even definitive type locality, and the implications of the latter on subsequent checklists and research. Second, we note differences between Boulenger's (1885) type description of L. p. major and Hulse's (1979) type description of L. capillitas. Third, we show that the syntypes of L. p. major photographed by Núñez (2004) do not exhibit the character states of L. capillitas. We conclude that L. capillitas is not a synonym of L. p. major. Based on the available evidence, the syntypes of L. p. major are probably assignable to Liolaemus elongatus from …

Robert Espinoza|The conservation status of the world´ s reptiles|Felix Benjamin Cruz, Robert Espinoza, Marcelo Fabio Tognelli|2013|||||Elsevier|Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as the distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world?s reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may currently be underestimated due to lack of population information …

The new species were previously considered conspecific with either Liolaemus walkeri in northeastern Chile or L. alticolor in northwestern Argentina and adjacent Chile. However, the new species differ from these taxa, and all other members of the alticolor group, in a number of characteristics. Liolaemus chaltin n. sp. differs from L. alticolor from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia) in the following ways: this new species has a larger body size; a fragmented vertebral stripe; and a pigmented subocular (white in L. alticolor), and is one of just three members of the alticolor group that is oviparous. Liolaemus puna n. sp. differs from all other members of the alticolor group in that male L. puna lack paravertebral markings and dorsolateral and vertebral stripes. Females, however, are similar to other members of the alticolor group but can be distinguished from them by several meristic characters. Liolaemus puna is widely distributed throughout the high-elevation (3680-4400 m) Puna regions (a flat or gently sloping steppe dominated by perennial bunch grasses and small shrubs) in northwestern Argentina and northeastern Chile. Liolaemus chaltin is known only from the Puna of central Jujuy Province, Argentina (3400-3750 m). Based on examinations of the type series of L. alticolor and L. walkeri, we determined that virtually all northern Chilean populations of Liolaemus previously considered to belong to either of these two species should be assigned to L. puna. Thus, the range of L. alticolor is restricted to …

That which is rare demands explanation. For these reasons, herbivorous reptiles have captured the attention of herpetologists for decades. Indeed, fewer than 1% of nonavian reptiles-both extinct and modern-were, or are, herbivorous. The paucity of herbivorous reptiles has been attributed to numerous factors including constraints associated with morphology, physiology, behavior, biogeography, evolutionary history, and divergence capabilities. Yet, despite a long and rich history of interest, no comprehensive treatise has been provided for this understudied trophic group of the Reptilia. This void is now partly filled by Gillian King's Reptiles and Herbivory. King, a paleontologist specializing in mammal-like reptiles (primarily dicynodonts), has produced a book that convenes much of the disparate literature on both extant and extinct reptilian herbivores …

Passerines as a whole and five passerine subclades were analyzed by both independent contrasts and simulation methods. In passerines as a whole, carotenoids and sexual dichromatism are positively correlated irrespective of analysis method. In three of the subclades, the correlations are significant by a clear majority of analysis methods. Neither melanin nor structurally derived colors show similar significant increases with dichromatism. Carotenoids are obtained by animals solely through the diet, whereas both melanins and structurally derived colors can be synthesized. The relationship between sexual dichromatism and the use of carotenoids in plumage suggests that sexual selection may have promoted the expression of a …

There are, however, no empirical studies capable of simultaneously evaluating several key predictions that contrast this with other speciation models. We present data on male pulse rates and female phonotactic responses to pulse rates for the field cricket Gryllus texensis; pulse rate is the key feature distinguishing G. texensis from its cryptic sister species G. rubens. We show (i) genetic variation in male song and in female preference for song, (ii) a genetic correlation between the male trait and the female preference, and (iii) no character displacement in male song, female song recognition, female species-level song discrimination, or female song preference. Combined with previous work demonstrating a lack of hybrid inviability, these results suggest that … 
David Gray|Female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, prefer the chirps of large males|David A Gray|1997/12/1|Animal behaviour|54|6|1553-1562|Academic Press|This study demonstrates that invertebrate acoustic signals can provide information about male phenotypic attributes, and that females can use this acoustic information in mate choice to select a phenotypically superior mate. I investigated the relationships between a male acoustic sexual signal, the phenotype of the signaller, and the female response to signal variation. I recorded and analysed the calling songs of male house crickets,Acheta domesticus. The analyses showed that chirps convey information about male size. With the exception of amplitude, the mean number of pulses per chirp was the best predictor of male size. I performed a laboratory tape-playback experiment to determine female preference during phonotaxis. Females preferred tapes playing the chirps of large males, specifically chirps with a greater number of pulses per chirp. Selection on the female preference is discussed.

To examine these factors, female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, were presented with a simultaneous choice between tapes of a priori attractive and unattractive male chirps. Females varied in age, nutritional condition, body size (potential fecundity), and size-relative reproductive investment. Female age had a significant effect on female choosiness: young females were selective, whereas older females were not selective. Nutritional condition, body size, and size-relative reproductive investment did not affect female choice. Females that chose the call of the attractive male spent approximately twice as long choosing as females that chose the unattractive male call. 
David Gray|QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE FIELD CRICKET, GRYLLUS INTEGER|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/6|Evolution|53|3|848-854||Major theories of sexual selection predict heritable variation in female preferences and male traits and a positive genetic correlation between preference and trait. Here we show that female Texas field crickets, Gryllus integer, have heritable genetic variation for the male calling song stimulus level that produces the greatest phonotactic response. Approximately 34% of the variation in female preferences was due to additive genetic effects. Female choosiness, that is, the strength of the female response to her most preferred stimulus relative to her average response to all stimuli, did not show significant genetic effects. The male calling song character was not related to male size or age but did show significant genetic effects. Approximately 39% of the variation in the number of pulses per trill was due to additive genetic variation. The genetic correlation estimated for the field population was 0.51 ± 0.17. The number of … 
David Gray|Sex, death, and genetic variation: natural and sexual selection on cricket song|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/4/7|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences|266|1420|707-709|The Royal Society|Male field crickets, Gryllus integer, in Texas, USA, produce a trilled calling song that attracts female crickets, resulting in enhanced mating success. Gravid female parasitoid flies, Ormia ochracea, are also attracted to male cricket calling song, resulting in the death of the male within about seven days. Using playbacks of field–cricket calling song in the natural habitat, we show that both female crickets and female parasitoid flies prefer male calling song with average numbers of pulses per trill. Thus female crickets exert stabilizing sexual selection, whereas flies exert disruptive natural selection on male song. Disruptive natural selection will promote genetic variation and population divergence. Stabilizing sexual selection will reduce genetic variation and maintain population cohesiveness. These forces may balance and together maintain the observed high levels of genetic variation (ca. 40%) in male calling song. 
David Gray|Is cricket courtship song condition dependent?|David A Gray, Gillian Eckhardt|2001/11/1|Animal Behaviour|62|5|871-877|Academic Press|Females of the Texas trilling field cricket, Gryllus texensis, show mating preferences based on male courtship song. To test experimentally the condition dependence of courtship song, we attempted to manipulate male condition via the diet. When the diet was manipulated at the adult moult, there was no effect on subsequent male courtship song or male condition measured as residual mass. When the diet was manipulated three moults prior to the adult moult, there was a significant effect on male residual mass, but no differences in courtship song were observed. To gain a second measure of condition in the diet-manipulated-as-nymphs group, we extracted their fat using petroleum ether in a refluxing Soxhlet apparatus. Crickets reared on the poor diet showed a clear relationship between the residual mass measure of condition and condition measured as energetic fat reserve, whereas the two measures of … 
David Gray|Fine-scale temperature effects on cricket calling song|Shannon D Martin, David A Gray, William H Cade|2000/5/1|Canadian Journal of Zoology|78|5|706-712|NRC Research Press|The effects of temperature on the structure of cricket calling song were examined in the trilling field cricket Gryllus integer. A repeated-measures design was used to assess the effects of temperature and individual differences among males simultaneously. Temperature affected most aspects of calling song, specifically pulse length, interpulse length, peak frequency, trill length, intertrill length, and pulse duty cycle. Unaffected by temperature were the number of pulses per trill, the proportion of pulses missed within a trill, and the trill duty cycle. After controlling for temperature, significant individual differences among crickets were found in peak frequency, number of pulses per trill, trill length, and intertrill interval. Both the environmental and individual, that is, possibly genetic, influences on calling song may influence sexual communication in this species. 
David Gray|Diversification under sexual selection: the relative roles of mate preference strength and the degree of divergence in mate preferences|Rafael L Rodríguez, Janette W Boughman, David A Gray, Eileen A Hebets, Gerlinde Höbel, Laurel B Symes|2013/8|Ecology letters|16|8|964-974||The contribution of sexual selection to diversification remains poorly understood after decades of research. This may be in part because studies have focused predominantly on the strength of sexual selection, which offers an incomplete view of selection regimes. By contrast, students of natural selection focus on environmental differences that help compare selection regimes across populations. To ask how this disparity in focus may affect the conclusions of evolutionary research, we relate the amount of diversification in mating displays to quantitative descriptions of the strength and the amount of divergence in mate preferences across a diverse set of case studies of mate choice. We find that display diversification is better explained by preference divergence rather than preference strength; the effect of the latter is more subtle, and is best revealed as an interaction with the former. Our findings cast the action of … 
David Gray|Agonistic Displays and the Benefits of Fighting in the Field Cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus|Gabrielle Tachon, Anne-Marie Murray, David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/7/1|Journal of Insect Behavior|12|4|533-543|Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers|Fighting is often composed of discrete agonistic displays. Few studies have partitioned fighting behavior into its component agonistic displays and evaluated the relationships between the frequency of the displays and the potential benefits of fighting, particularly mating success. In this study, we quantified the frequency of male field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, agonistic displays. The displays were quantified under three social environments which varied in the potential benefits of fighting: males with other males only, males with other males and female scents, and males with other males and females. We found that (1) the presence of females elicited an increase in agonistic displays characteristic of intermediate levels of escalation, (2) female scents did not produce a similar increase in the frequency of agonistic displays, and (3) in the presence of females, the frequency of agonistic displays was positively … 
David Gray|Divergence between the courtship songs of the field crickets Gryllus texensis and Gryllus rubens (Orthoptera, Gryllidae)|Mark J Fitzpatrick, David A Gray|2001/12/29|Ethology|107|12|1075-1085|Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)|Acoustic mating signals are often important as both interspecific prezygotic isolating mechanisms and as sexually selected traits in intraspecific mate choice. Here, we investigate the potential for cricket courtship song to act as an isolating mechanism by assessing divergence between the courtship songs of Gryllus texensis and Gryllus rubens, two broadly sympatric cryptic sister species of field crickets with strong prezygotic isolation via the calling song and little or no postzygotic isolation. We found significant species‐level differences in the courtship song, but the song has not diverged to the same extent as the calling song, and considerable overlap remains between these two species. Only two related courtship song characters are sufficiently distinct to play a possible role in prezygotic species isolation. 
David Gray|Does courtship behavior contribute to species-level reproductive isolation in field crickets?|David A Gray|2004/7/21|Behavioral Ecology|16|1|201-206|Oxford University Press|Reproductive behavior influences gene flow within and among species; thus, sexual selection may be a major contributor to the maintenance of species, and possibly their formation. Here I experimentally manipulate the courtship interactions of the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis to examine the potential of close-range courtship interactions to limit interspecific gene flow. Responses of males to females and of females to male courtship song and males per se were examined for four paired sympatric and allopatric populations. Male G. rubens were more likely to court conspecific females, but male G. texensis courted females of both species equally. If paired with conspecific males, female G. rubens and G. texensis both preferred conspecific courtship song. In none of these comparisons were the responses of males or females from allopatry different from those in sympatry. There was an asymmetry …

David Gray|Billions and billions sold: pet-feeder crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), commercial cricket farms, an epizootic densovirus, and government regulations make for a potential disaster|David B Weissman, David A Gray, Hanh Thi Pham, Peter Tijssen|2012/10/2|Zootaxa|3504|1|67-88|Magnolia Press|The cricket pet food industry in the United States, where as many as 50 million crickets are shipped a week, is a multimillion dollar business that has been devastated by epizootic Acheta domesticus densovirus (AdDNV) outbreaks. Efforts to find an alternative, virus-resistant field cricket species have led to the widespread USA (and European) distribution of a previously unnamed Gryllus species despite existing USA federal regulations to prevent such movement. We analyze and describe this previously unnamed Gryllus and propose additional measures to minimize its potential risk to native fauna and agriculture. Additionally, and more worrisome, is our incidental finding that the naturally widespread African, European, and Asian “black cricket,” G. bimaculatus, is also being sold illegally in southern California pet food stores. We assayed crickets of all five USA and European commercial species for presence of the AdDNV to document extent of the infection—all five species can be infected with the virus but only A. domesticus is killed. Based on its already cosmopolitan distribution, apparent inability to live away from human habitation, and resistance to AdDNV, we suggest that Gryllodes sigillatus is the best-suited replacement cricket for commercial production. 
David Gray|Size–dependent response to conspecific mating calls by male crickets|Moshe Kiflawi, David A Gray|2000/11/7|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences|267|1458|2157-2161|The Royal Society|Male sexual displays provide females with information that is crucial to their reproductive decisions. That same information is available to eavesdroppers, with potential consequences for both signaller and receiver. We present empirical evidence for size–dependent responses to intersexual communication by conspecific rivals. Acoustic features of a male house cricket's (Acheta domesticus) mating call are positively associated with its size, with females preferring the calls of larger males. In order to investigate whether conspecific males make use of the information content of mating calls, we examined their phonotactic responses to call recordings that differ in attractiveness to females. Males of all sizes exhibited positive phonotaxis, with smaller males showing a clear preference for female–preferred calls. Smaller males were also less likely to seek contact with the speaker playing their chosen call. We discuss … 
David Gray|Behavioural specialization among populations of the acoustically orienting parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea utilizing different cricket species as hosts|David A Gray, Christina Banuelos, Sean E Walker, William H Cade, Marlene Zuk|2007/1/1|Animal Behaviour|73|1|99-104|Academic Press|Tightly coupled evolutionary associations between parasites and their hosts are well known. What is less well characterized is the behavioural specialization of parasites that exploit different hosts in different parts of the parasite's geographical range. Here we examine behavioural specialization among populations of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, that exploit different host species of crickets in different parts of the fly's range. We conducted a field experiment to compare phonotactic attraction of flies from Florida, Texas, California and Hawaii (U.S.A.) to the songs of their local host species of cricket versus their attraction to the songs of species of crickets utilized as hosts elsewhere within the flies' range. We found strong behavioural specialization of fly populations, with preferential phonotaxis towards the song of the local host species of cricket. These results suggest strong behavioural specialization of flies, but that … 
David Gray|Heterospecific courtship and sequential mate choice in sister species of field crickets|Amanda S Izzo, David A Gray|2011/1/1|Animal behaviour|81|1|259-264|Academic Press|During mate selection, females of most species encounter males sequentially and may use a variety of decision rules whereby the attractiveness of a current potential mate is affected by sampling of previous individuals. The perceived distribution of male quality might therefore affect female mate choice. Mate choice among closely related taxa may additionally be affected by a perceived rarity of conspecifics. Here we tested whether female mate choice in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis is affected by prior experience with either conspecific or heterospecific males. Specifically, we tested whether female acceptance of conspecific or heterospecific males is influenced by prior exposure to a conspecific or heterospecific male. Our results indicate that there is a clear previous-male effect, but that it differs across species. When ‘high-quality’ (i.e. conspecific) males are common, females are predicted to … 
David Gray|Cricket Song in Sympatry: Species Specificity of Song without Reproductive Character Displacement in Gryllus rubens|Amanda S Izzo, David A Gray|2004/7/1|Annals of the Entomological Society of America|97|4|831-837|Entomological Society of America|Previous work with the cryptic sister species pair of field crickets, Gryllus texensis Cade & Otte and Gryllus rubens Scudder, has implicated sexual selection in the speciation process. That study examined reproductive character displacement (RCD) in male song and female preference for song in G. texensis. No evidence of RCD was found. Here, we provide a similar analysis of RCD in G. rubens song and examine the songs of both species from areas of sympatry in an effort to document the species-specificity of song in sympatry and to look for individuals with songs indicative of F1 hybrid status. We 1) find no evidence for RCD in G. rubens song, 2) demonstrate the distinctness of song in sympatry, and 3) document the rarity of songs typical of F1 hybrids.

One such species, Gryllus assimilis (F.), as currently characterized, occurs in the West Indies, Brazil, Central America, and Mexico, and in five of the southernmost U.S. states. Our studies of calling songs and morphology indicate that at least three species exist among these populations. The type locality of G. assimilis is Jamaica, but the type specimen is lost and two similar species of Gryllus occur there. One of these species occurs widely outside of Jamaica, and we assign it to G. assimilis and designate a neotype. The other occurs only in Jamaica and is assigned to Gryllus jamaicensis T. J. Walker n. sp. Nearly all populations formerly known as G. assimilis from southern California, southern Arizona, southern Nevada, and Mexico west … 
David Gray|Song repertoires and sensory exploitation: reconsidering the case of the common grackle|David A Gray, Julie C Hagelin|1996/10/1|Animal Behaviour|52|4|795-800|Academic Press|Male common grackles,Quiscalus quiscula, sing one song type each, yet females prefer multiple songs. A pre-existing sensory bias explanation has been proposed to account for these results. Using phylogenetic analysis and published behavioural studies, (1) it is shown that the single-song condition of males is likely to be the derived state, and (2) it is suggested that female common grackles' preference for multiple songs may not be surprising given their natural history, and may in fact be a functional preference. The idea that the female preference is also ancestral and serves no current function, however, cannot be ruled out. 
David Gray|Conservation of multivariate female preference functions and preference mechanisms in three species of trilling field crickets|T Blankers, RM Hennig, DA Gray|2015/3|Journal of evolutionary biology|28|3|630-641||Divergence in mate recognition systems among closely related species is an important contributor to assortative mating and reproductive isolation. Here, we examine divergence in male song traits and female preference functions in three cricket species with songs consisting of long trills. The shape of female preference functions appears to be mostly conserved across species and follows the predictions from a recent model for song recognition. Multivariate preference profiles, combining the pulse and trill parameters, demonstrate selectivity for conspecific pulse rates and high trill duty cycles. The rules for integration across pulse and trill timescales were identical for all three species. Generally, we find greater divergence in male song traits than in associated female preferences. For pulse rate, we find a strong match between divergent male traits and female peak preferences. Preference functions for trill …

When species divergence is relatively recent, the footprint of the demographic history during speciation might be preserved and used to reconstruct the biogeography of species divergence. In this study, patterns of genetic variation were examined throughout the geographical range of two cryptic sister taxa of field crickets, Gryllus texensis and G. rubens; mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) was sequenced in 365 individuals sampled from 48 localities. Despite significant molecular divergence between the species, they were not reciprocally monophyletic. We devised several analyses to statistically explore what historical processes might have given rise to this genealogical structure. The analyses indicated that the biogeographical pattern of genetic …

Here, we review and analyze via simulation Hedges’ g, a widely used parametric estimate of effect size. Our analyses indicate that g is sensitive to a combination of unequal trait variances and unequal sample sizes among populations and to changes in the scale of measurement. We then go on to derive and explain a new, non-parametric distance measure, “Δp”, which is calculated based upon a joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) from all populations under study. More precisely, distances are measured in terms of the percentiles in this CDF at which each population’s median lies. Δp combines many desirable features of other distance metrics into a single metric; namely, compared to other metrics, p … 
David Gray|How acoustic signals scale with individual body size: common trends across diverse taxa|Rafael L Rodríguez, Marcelo Araya-Salas, David A Gray, Michael S Reichert, Laurel B Symes, Matthew R Wilkins, Rebecca J Safran, Gerlinde Höbel|2014/10/3|Behavioral ecology|26|1|168-177|Oxford University Press|We use allometric analysis to explore how acoustic signals scale on individual body size and to test hypotheses about the factors shaping relationships between signals and body size. Across case studies spanning birds, crickets, tree crickets, and tree frogs, we find that most signal traits had low coefficients of variation, shallow allometric scalings, and little dispersion around the allometric function. We relate variation in these measures to the shape of mate preferences and the level of condition dependence of signal traits. We find 3 major patterns: 1) signal traits associated with closed mate preferences had lower coefficients of variation and shallower allometries than signal traits with open preferences, 2) signal traits with higher levels of condition dependence had higher coefficients of variation and steeper allometries, and 3) the relationship between condition dependence and allometry varied with preference … 
David Gray|Host song selection by an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly exploiting a multispecies assemblage of cricket hosts|Kelly M Sakaguchi, David A Gray|2011/4/1|Animal Behaviour|81|4|851-858|Academic Press|Specialization by predators, parasites and parasitoids is often viewed as adaptive because specialization will usually increase search efficiency for suitable hosts (prey). Although many studies have documented interspecific variation in the degree of host specialization, few studies have examined intraspecific variation in specialization among different populations exploiting different numbers of hosts, and even fewer have specifically examined variation in behavioural specialization. Here we examine the acoustic preferences of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, which attacks several Gryllus species of field crickets by using the male cricket song to locate hosts. All previous studies with this system have examined fly song preferences in populations of flies that primarily exploit a single host species of cricket. Here we tested a population of flies that naturally parasitizes multiple cricket species. We found significant … 
David Gray|Describing mate preference functions and other function‐valued traits|JT Kilmer, KD Fowler‐Finn, DA Gray, G Höbel, D Rebar, MS Reichert, RL Rodríguez|2017/9|Journal of evolutionary biology|30|9|1658-1673||Mate preferences are important causes of sexual selection. They shape the evolution of sexual ornaments and displays, sometimes maintaining genetic diversity and sometimes promoting speciation. Mate preferences can be challenging to study because they are expressed in animal brains and because they are a function of the features of potential mates that are encountered. Describing them requires taking this into account. We present a method for describing and analysing mate preference functions, and introduce a freely available computer program that implements the method. We give an overview of how the program works, and we discuss how it can be used to visualize and quantitatively analyse preference functions. In addition, we provide an informal review of different methods of testing mate preferences, with recommendations for how best to set up experiments on mate preferences. Although the … 
David Gray|The judder of the cricket: The variance underlying the invariance in behavior|Sergio M Pellis, David A Gray, William H Cade|2009|||||International Journal of Comparative Psychology|While the behavior of many animals can be identified as involving discrete and stereotyped actions, there is a persistent tension between emphasizing the fixedness of the actions (“Fixed Action Patterns”) and emphasizing the variation in the components comprising those actions (“Modal ActionPatterns”). One such action, the back and forward judder of crickets often exhibited in agonistic interactions, was analyzed. Judders occurring on a horizontal surface by Gryllus bimaculatus were compared to those occurring on an inclined platform. Although the body movements involved were variable, that variability occurred in the context of maintaining some features of judder invariant. For example, the crickets maintained their bodies so that they were horizontal relative to the substrate, not to gravity, and most features of the back and forward movement (e.g., distance moved, velocity) were maintained as fixed despite differences in posture and movement. At a theoretical level, what these findings suggest is that behavior patterns involve a combination of fixedness and variation in the service of that fixedness. It becomes an empirical issue to discern these complementary components.

David Gray|Senescence in field crickets (Orthoptera; Gryllidae): examining the effects of sex and a sex-biased parasitoid|David A Gray, William H Cade|2000/2/28|Canadian journal of zoology|78|1|140-143|NRC Research Press|The evolutionary theory of aging proposes that senescence is related to decreased selection against deleterious mutations acting late in life. Senescence, i.e., an increase in intrinsic mortality with age, should reflect levels of extrinsic mortality early in life. We tested these predictions using two species of field cricket, Gryllus integer and Gryllus pennsylvanicus. Gryllus integer males are host to a sex-biased parasitoid fly, which orients to the male calling song. As a result, males have reduced life expectancy compared with females in the field. In contrast, G. pennsylvanicus males and females appear to have similar life expectancies in the wild. Thus, we predicted that there would be a significant species × sex interaction, with G. integer males having the shortest life-span. In two replicates, we found that males of both species died at a significantly younger age than females. However, no evidence of a species × sex … 
David Gray|Divergence in male cricket song and female preference functions in three allopatric sister species|Ralf Matthias Hennig, Thomas Blankers, David A Gray|2016/5/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology A|202|5|347-360|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Multivariate female preference functions for male sexual signals have rarely been investigated, especially in a comparative context among sister species. Here we examined male signal and female preference co-variation in three closely related, but allopatric species of Gryllus crickets and quantified male song traits as well as female preferences. We show that males differ conspicuously in either one of two relatively static song traits, carrier frequency or pulse rate; female preference functions for these traits also differed, and would in combination enhance species discrimination. In contrast, the relatively dynamic song traits, chirp rate and chirp duty cycle, show minimal divergence among species and relatively greater conservation of female preference functions. Notably, among species we demonstrate similar mechanistic rules for the integration of pulse and chirp time scales, despite divergence in pulse … 
David Gray|Individual consistency, learning and memory in a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea|Jennifer Paur, David A Gray|2011/10/1|Animal behaviour|82|4|825-830|Academic Press|Search images are expected to be important components of predator and parasitoid search strategies as they reduce the search time for prey and hosts. Fixed search images, however, may constrain predators and parasitoids, and render them ineffective at switching to new more abundant prey or hosts. For switching behaviour to be effective, parasitoids need to be able to learn cues associated with abundant hosts, and they need to be able to extinguish preferences for the cues of hosts that are no longer abundant. Here we use the Gryllus cricket and Ormia ochracea parasitoid fly system to show (1) individual consistency in fly preference for song in the field, (2) learning of host song in the laboratory and (3) that the flies’ memory for learned host cues is very short term. These results are interesting and novel in several respects. First, our demonstration that O. ochracea satisfies each of the characteristics of an … 
David Gray|Correlated-response-to-selection experiments designed to test for a genetic correlation between female preferences and male traits yield biased results|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/12/1||58|6|1325-1327|Academic Press|The genetic correlation between mating preferences and sexually selected (epigamic) traits is a central issue in both Fisherian and good genes models of mate choice (Fisher 1930; O’Donald 1980; Lande 1981; Pomiankowski 1988). One method of demonstrating the existence of a genetic correlation is to select on one trait, and observe if a second trait shows a correlated response to selection (Lande & Arnold 1983; Falconer 1989). This has become the most commonly adopted method of testing for a genetic correlation between mating preferences and epigamic traits: eight of 12 studies reviewed by Bakker & Pomiankowski (1995) used this method. In this commentary, we extend and clarify methodological issues first raised by Butlin (1993), and argue that correlated-response (CR) methods will overestimate the genetic correlation, and may even incorrectly identify a genetic correlation when none in fact exists.

We analyzed 1460 base pairs from 10 individuals of each species; individuals were sampled from areas of both allopatry and sympatry. Overall average pairwise mitochondrial sequence divergence between species was 1.4% ± 0.1% (mean ± SD); however, there was almost an order of magnitude more divergence in COI (2.59% ± 2.25%) than in CytB (0.35% ± 0.24%). Gryllus texensis appears to harbor a much greater level of genetic variation than does G. rubens.

David Gray|Multivariate female preference tests reveal latent perceptual biases|DA Gray, E Gabel, T Blankers, RM Hennig|2016/11/16|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|283|1842|20161972|The Royal Society|The question of why males of many species produce elaborate mating displays has now been largely resolved: females prefer to mate with males that produce such displays. However, the question of why females prefer such displays has been controversial, with an emerging consensus that such displays often provide information to females about the direct fitness benefits that males provide to females and/or the indirect fitness benefits provided to offspring. Alternative explanations, such as production of arbitrarily attractive sons or innate pre-existing female sensory or perceptual bias, have also received support in certain taxa. Here, we describe multivariate female preference functions for male acoustic traits in two chirping species of field crickets with slow pulse rates; our data reveal cryptic female preferences for long trills that have not previously been observed in other chirping species. The trill preferences are …

Here we compare levels of divergence in three allopatric sister species of field crickets. We compare divergence in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, male song, female ovipositor length, levels of pre- and postzygotic isolation, and male versus female contributions to prezygotic isolation. Taken together, our data show the accumulation of a multitude of potential reproductive isolating barriers if secondary contact were to become established. Furthermore, ecological and behavioural prezygotic isolation appear significantly more advanced than postzygotic isolation, with prezygotic isolation due to female behaviour exceeding that due to male behaviour.

Taken together our results suggest (1) that O. ochracea lacks a highly effective pupal diapause, (2) that spring adult field cricket species are safe from the fly, and (3) that most of the late fall flies die without reproducing. 
David Gray|Multivariate Phenotypic Evolution: Divergent Acoustic Signals and Sexual Selection in Gryllus Field Crickets|Thomas Blankers, David A Gray, R Matthias Hennig|2017/3/1|Evolutionary Biology|44|1|43-55|Springer US|Predicting the response to selection is at the core of evolutionary biology. Presently, thorough understanding of the effects of selection on the multivariate phenotype is lacking, in particular for behavioral traits. Here, we compared multivariate acoustic mating signals among seven field cricket species contrasting two selection regimes: (1) species producing songs with long trains of pulses for which preference functions for acoustic energy (chirp duty cycle) are linear and likely exert strong directional selection (‘trillers’); (2) species producing songs consisting of short chirps and for which preference functions for chirp duty cycle are concave and directional selection is likely weak or absent (‘chirpers’). We compared the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix (P) among species and uncovered two main patterns: First, surprisingly, pulse rate and chirp rate were positively correlated in six of seven species thus … 
David Gray|Male armaments and reproductive behavior in “nutcracker” camel crickets (Rhaphidophoridae, Pristoceuthophilus)|Lauren Conroy, David Gray|2015/3|Insects|6|1|85-99|Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute|Males of many species possess striking weaponry used in intrasexual competition for access to females. Until recently, there were no known cases of male weaponry being used against females in sexual coercion. However, in the camel cricket, Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus, males use modified hind legs to fight with each other and also to trap females and force them to copulate. To determine whether hind leg armaments serve similar fighting and mating functions in morphologically similar congeners, we performed a comparative survey of armament use in intra-and inter-sexual interactions in four additional species of Pristoceuthophilus (P. arizonae and three undescribed species: P.‘Huachuca summer,’P.‘Madera’and P.‘Mt. Pinos’). Intrasexual leg fighting occurred in all species for which trials were performed, and hints of sexual coercion occurred in two species (P.‘Huachuca summer’and P.‘Mt. Pinos’), suggesting additional cases of a uniquely dual-purpose armament. These findings suggest an evolutionary exaptation of hind leg armaments in this genus, wherein an intrasexual fighting weapon took on a secondary function of sexual coercion. View Full-Text 
David Gray|Speciation, divergence, and the origin of Gryllus rubens: behavior, morphology, and molecules|David A Gray|2011/6||2|2|195-209|Molecular Diversity Preservation International|The last 25 years or so has seen a huge resurgence of interest in speciation research. This has coincided with the development and widespread use of new tools in molecular genetics, especially DNA sequencing, to inform ecological and evolutionary questions. Here I review about a decade of work on the sister species of field crickets Gryllus texensis and G. rubens. This work has included analysis of morphology, behavior, and the mitochondrial DNA molecule. The molecular work in particular has dramatically re-shaped my interpretation of the speciational history of these taxa, suggesting that rather than ‘sister’species we should consider these taxa as ‘mother-daughter’species with G. rubens derived from within a subset of ancestral G. texensis.

David Gray|A Modified Mole Cricket Lure and Description of Scapteriscus borellii (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) Range Expansion and Calling Song in California|Adler R Dillman, Christopher J Cronin, Joseph Tang, David A Gray, Paul W Sternberg|2014/2/1|Environmental entomology|43|1|146-156|Oxford University Press|Invasive mole cricket species in the genus Scapteriscus have become significant agricultural pests and are continuing to expand their range in North America. Though largely subterranean, adults of some species, such as Scapteriscus borellii Giglio-Tos 1894, are capable of long dispersive flights and phonotaxis to male calling songs to find suitable habitats and mates. Mole crickets in the genus Scapteriscus are known to be attracted to and can be caught by audio lure traps that broadcast synthesized or recorded calling songs. We report improvements in the design and production of electronic controllers for the automation of semipermanent mole cricket trap lures as well as highly portable audio trap collection designs. Using these improved audio lure traps, we collected the first reported individuals of the pest mole cricket S. borellii in California. We describe several characteristic features of the calling song of … 
David Gray|Abdominal tubercles of adult male camel crickets, Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae), produce cues attractive to females|Estenia Lisseth Haley, David A Gray|2013/11/1|Journal of insect behavior|26|6|804-811|Springer US|In contrast to many crickets and katydids, adult male camel crickets (Orthoptera: Raphidophoridae) do not stridulate and do not produce audible air-borne calling songs to attract females for mating. The mating behavior of most camel cricket species is undescribed; how pair-formation occurs is unknown, but chemical cues seem one likely possibility. In the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn, we test (1) the role of chemical cues in conspecific attraction, and (2) the role of the abdominal tubercles of adult males in producing those cues. We show (1) that virgin adult females are attracted to paper towels previously exposed to adult males, and (2) that paper towels previously exposed to adult males with exposed tubercles are more attractive than paper towels previously exposed to adult males with experimentally closed tubercles. In addition, we present Scanning Electron Microscope photos of … 
David Gray|Sexual selection, phenotypic and genetic quality in house crickets, Acheta domesticus.|David Andrew Gray|1998||||5235-5235||Degree: Ph. D. DegreeYear: 1997 Institute: The University of New Mexico Adviser: A. Kodric-Brown. Sexual selection in House crickets, Acheta domesticus, was investigated. Male chirps attract females for mating. The number of pulses per chirp was related to male size. Females preferred chirps with more pulses per chirp. Thus female phonotaxis was biased toward larger males. The female bias in phonotaxis was expressed in younger but not older females. Females choosing the larger males''chirp spent more time in mate selection than females which chose the smaller males''chirp. Male body size was found to be heritable. The heritability of size was higher under benign nutritional conditions than under stressful nutritional conditions. As compared to smaller males, larger males developed more quickly, and produced larger but not more numerous spermatophores. Larger females had higher fecundity than smaller … 
David Gray|Forced copulation as a conditional alternative strategy in camel crickets|Lauren P Conroy, David A Gray|2014/9/1|Behavioral ecology and sociobiology|68|9|1431-1439|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|In the animal kingdom, males typically acquire reproductive access to females through courtship, nuptial gifts, or combat. In many species, small or poor-condition males that are unable to produce an attractive display, proffer an adequate mating gift, or dominate in male–male competition may resort to forced copulation. Forced copulation has been previously demonstrated in the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus and is uniquely facilitated by male hind leg weaponry that functions in both intrasexual competition and sexual coercion. Because male leg armaments are positively allometric, the largest males would seem best equipped to force-copulate, although they might be the most attractive to females, and so least likely to adopt a forced copulation strategy. In order to resolve this potential paradox and determine which males are in fact most likely to force-copulate, we manipulated male body … 
David Gray|Induced expression of a vestigial sexual signal|David A Gray, Scherezade Hormozi, Fritz R Libby, Randy W Cohen|2018/5/16|Biology letters|14|5|20180095|The Royal Society|Vestigial morphological traits are common and well known in a variety of taxa. Identification of vestigial genes has illustrated the potential for evolutionary reversals and the re-expression of atavistic traits. Here we induce expression of a behavioural sexual signal, male calling song, in a cricket species, Gryllus ovisopis, which lacks a functional calling song. We successfully used acetylcholine injections in the frontal space of the head of male crickets to activate cerebral command neurons for cricket calling, and we recorded calling songs with a temporal chirp pattern similar to that of G. ovisopis' close evolutionary relatives, G. firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, implying that the neural pattern generators that underlie cricket calling behaviour persist in a vestigial state in G. ovisopis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the induced expression of a vestigial behaviour in any organism. The retention of latent …

Here, we assess transcriptomic variation to unravel the evolutionary history of Gryllus rubens and Gryllus texensis, cryptic field cricket species with highly divergent mating behavior. We infer their demographic history and screen their transcriptomes for footprints of selection in the context of the inferred demography. We find strong support for a long history of bidirectional gene flow, which ceased during the late Pleistocene, and a bottleneck in G. rubens consistent with a peripatric origin of this species. Importantly, the demographic history has likely strongly shaped patterns of genetic differentiation (empirical FST distribution). Concordantly, FST‐based selection detection uncovers a large number of outliers, likely comprising many false positives, echoing recent … 
David Gray|How females of chirping and trilling field crickets integrate the ‘what’and ‘where’of male acoustic signals during decision making|Eileen Gabel, David A Gray, R Matthias Hennig|2016/11/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology A|202|11|823-837|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|In crickets acoustic communication serves mate selection. Female crickets have to perceive and integrate male cues relevant for mate choice while confronted with several different signals in an acoustically diverse background. Overall female decisions are based on the attractiveness of the temporal pattern (informative about the ‘what’) and on signal intensity (informative about the ‘where’) of male calling songs. Here, we investigated how the relevant cues for mate choice are integrated during the decision process by females of five different species of chirping and trilling field crickets. Using a behavioral design, female preferences in no-choice and choice situations for male calling songs differing in pulse rate, modulation depth, intensities, chirp/trill arrangements and temporal shifts were examined. Sensory processing underlying decisions in female field crickets is rather similar as combined evidence …

David Gray|Call recognition and female choice in a treefrog with a multicomponent call|Mark V Oliva, Kristine Kaiser, Jeanne M Robertson, David A Gray|2018/5|Ethology|124|5|331-337||Acoustic mating signals are typically species‐specific, and often additionally are subject to directional female preferences. Male executioner treefrogs, Dendropsophus carnifex, produce a multicomponent advertisement call composed of an introductory screech note followed by two or more click notes. Here, we tested (i) call recognition by comparing female directed phonotaxis towards individual and combined call components: screech vs. clicks vs. screech + clicks, (ii) female preferences for greater numbers of click notes and (iii) female preferences for faster call rates. The results demonstrated that screeches and clicks, presented either separately or together as a complete call, evoke similar female responses, suggesting that either note was sufficient to elicit a mate‐recognition response. Additionally, females preferred calls with greater numbers of click notes and with faster call rates. We interpret these results … 
David Gray|Observations of the acoustic behavior of Hoplosphyrum boreale (Scudder): a common scaly cricket of Southern California|Jonelle Saidy, David A Gray|2004/4/1|Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences|103|1|34-44|Southern California Academy of Sciences|We describe observations of the acoustic behavior of the scaly cricket Hoplosphyrum boreale (Scudder), a common scaly-cricket (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Mogoplistinae) of southern California and the desert southwest. The long-range calling song used by males to attract females from a distance is compared to song produced in close-range courtship interactions between males and females. We also describe preliminary observations of mating behavior, and the song of a sympatric undescribed species.********** In comparison to field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Gryllinae), ground crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Nemobiinae), and tree crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Oecanthinae), the acoustics and behavior of scaly crickets have received little attention. Scaly crickets are so named because small'scales' cover nearly the entire body surface (Love & Walker 1979; Yang & Yen 2001). Although there are approximately … 
Jonathan Kelber|Visualizing extravasation dynamics of metastatic tumor cells|Konstantin Stoletov, Hisashi Kato, Erin Zardouzian, Jonathan Kelber, Jing Yang, Sanford Shattil, Richard Klemke|2010/7/1|J Cell Sci|123|13|2332-2341|The Company of Biologists Ltd|Little is known about how metastatic cancer cells arrest in small capillaries and traverse the vascular wall during extravasation in vivo. Using real-time intravital imaging of human tumor cells transplanted into transparent zebrafish, we show here that extravasation of cancer cells is a highly dynamic process that involves the modulation of tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium and intravascular cell migration along the luminal surface of the vascular wall. Tumor cells do not damage or induce vascular leak at the site of extravasation, but rather induce local vessel remodeling characterized by clustering of endothelial cells and cell-cell junctions. Intravascular locomotion of tumor cells is independent of the direction of blood flow and requires β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to the blood-vessel wall. Interestingly, the expression of the pro-metastatic gene Twist in tumor cells increases their intravascular migration and … 
Jonathan Kelber|GRP78 and Cripto form a complex at the cell surface and collaborate to inhibit transforming growth factor β signaling and enhance cell growth|Gidi Shani, Wolfgang H Fischer, Nicholas J Justice, Jonathan A Kelber, Wylie Vale, Peter C Gray|2008/1/15|Molecular and cellular biology|28|2|666-677|American Society for Microbiology Journals|Cripto is a multifunctional cell surface protein with important roles in vertebrate embryogenesis and the progression of human tumors. While Cripto has been shown to modulate multiple signaling pathways, its binding partners do not appear to fully explain its molecular actions. Therefore, we conducted a screen aimed at identifying novel Cripto-interacting proteins. This screen led to our identification of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is also expressed at the surfaces of tumor cells. Here we demonstrate that Cripto and GRP78 interact at the cell surfaces of multiple cell lines and that their interaction is independent of prior association within the ER. Interestingly, short hairpin RNA knockdown of endogenous GRP78 resulted in enhanced transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, indicating that like Cripto, GRP78 inhibits this pathway. We further show that … 
Jonathan Kelber|Blockade of Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 inhibits oncogenic Cripto signaling via MAPK/PI3K and Smad2/3 pathways|JA Kelber, AD Panopoulos, G Shani, EC Booker, JC Belmonte, WW Vale, PC Gray|2009/6|Oncogene|28|24|2324|Nature Publishing Group|Cripto is a developmental oncoprotein that signals via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Smad2/3 pathways. However, the molecular basis for Cripto coupling to these pathways during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis is not fully understood. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that Cripto forms a cell surface complex with the HSP70 family member glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78). Here, we provide novel functional evidence demonstrating that cell surface GRP78 is a necessary mediator of Cripto signaling in human tumor, mammary epithelial and embryonic stem cells. We show that targeted disruption of the cell surface Cripto/GRP78 complex using shRNAs or GRP78 immunoneutralization precludes Cripto activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways and modulation of activin-A, activin-B, Nodal and transforming …

Cancer patients with brain metastases display poor prognosis and survival due to the lack of effective therapeutics and treatment strategies. Recent work using intravital microscopy and preclinical animal models indicates that metastatic cells colonize the brain, specifically in close contact with the existing brain vasculature. However, it is not known how contact with the vascular niche promotes microtumor formation. Here, we investigate the role of connexins in mediating early events in brain colonization using transparent zebrafish and chicken embryo models of brain metastasis. We provide evidence that breast cancer and melanoma cells utilize connexin gap junction proteins (Cx43, Cx26) to initiate brain metastatic lesion formation in association with the vasculature.

Jonathan Kelber|Cripto binds transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and inhibits TGF-β signaling|Peter C Gray, Gidi Shani, Kevin Aung, Jonathan Kelber, Wylie Vale|2006/12/15|Molecular and cellular biology|26|24|9268-9278|American Society for Microbiology Journals|Cripto is a developmental oncoprotein and a member of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto, FRL-1, Cryptic family of extracellular signaling molecules. In addition to having essential functions during embryogenesis, Cripto is highly expressed in tumors and promotes tumorigenesis. During development, Cripto acts as an obligate coreceptor for transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands, including nodals, growth and differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), and GDF3. As an oncogene, Cripto is thought to promote tumor growth via mechanisms including activation of mitogenic signaling pathways and antagonism of activin signaling. Here, we provide evidence supporting a novel mechanism in which Cripto inhibits the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. Cripto bound TGF-β and reduced the association of TGF-β with its type I receptor, TβRI. Consistent with its ability to block receptor assembly, Cripto suppressed TGF-β …

Here, we report that the novel tyrosine kinase PEAK1 is upregulated in human malignancies, including human PDACs and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Oncogenic KRas induced a PEAK1-dependent kinase amplification loop between Src, PEAK1, and ErbB2 to drive PDAC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Surprisingly, blockade of ErbB2 expression increased Src-dependent PEAK1 expression, PEAK1-dependent Src activation, and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting a mechanism for the observed resistance of patients with PDACs to therapeutic intervention. Importantly, PEAK1 inactivation sensitized PDAC cells to trastuzumab and gemcitabine therapy. Our findings, therefore, suggest that PEAK1 is a novel biomarker … 
Jonathan Kelber|Cancer cell migration within 3D layer-by-layer microfabricated photocrosslinked PEG scaffolds with tunable stiffness|Pranav Soman, Jonathan A Kelber, Jin Woo Lee, Tracy N Wright, Kenneth S Vecchio, Richard L Klemke, Shaochen Chen|2012/10/1|Biomaterials|33|29|7064-7070|Elsevier|Our current understanding of 3-dimensional (3D) cell migration is primarily based on results from fibrous scaffolds with randomly organized internal architecture. Manipulations that change the stiffness of these 3D scaffolds often alter other matrix parameters that can modulate cell motility independently or synergistically, making observations less predictive of how cells behave when migrating in 3D. In order to decouple microstructural influences and stiffness effects, we have designed and fabricated 3D polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds that permit orthogonal tuning of both elastic moduli and microstructure. Scaffolds with log-pile architectures were used to compare the 3D migration properties of normal breast epithelial cells (HMLE) and Twist-transformed cells (HMLET). Our results indicate that the nature of cell migration is significantly impacted by the ability of cells to migrate in the third dimension. 2D ECM …

Here, we report the discovery of a cytoskeleton-associated kinase, pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1). PEAK1 is a 190-kDa nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that localizes to actin filaments and focal adhesions. PEAK1 undergoes Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, regulates the p130Cas-Crk-paxillin and Erk signaling pathways, and operates downstream of integrin and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) to control cell spreading, migration, and proliferation. Perturbation of PEAK1 levels in cancer cells alters anchorage-independent growth and tumor progression in mice. Notably, primary and metastatic samples from colon cancer patients display amplified PEAK1 levels in 81% of the cases. Our findings indicate that PEAK1 is an important cytoskeletal regulatory kinase and possible target … 
Jonathan Kelber|Cripto is a noncompetitive activin antagonist that forms analogous signaling complexes with activin and nodal|Jonathan A Kelber, Gidi Shani, Evan C Booker, Wylie W Vale, Peter C Gray|2008/2/22|Journal of Biological Chemistry|283|8|4490-4500|American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|Cripto plays critical roles during embryogenesis and has been implicated in promoting the growth and spread of tumors. Cripto is required for signaling by certain transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, such as Nodal, but also antagonizes others, such as activin. The opposing effects of Cripto on Nodal and activin signaling seem contradictory, however, because these closely related ligands utilize the same type I (ALK4) and type II (ActRII/IIB) receptors. Here, we have addressed this apparent paradox by demonstrating that Cripto forms analogous receptor complexes with Nodal and activin and functions as a noncompetitive activin antagonist. Our results show that activin-A and Nodal elicit similar maximal signaling responses in the presence of Cripto that are substantially lower than that of activin-A in the absence of Cripto. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence for complexes containing activin-A …

Here, we investigated how eIF5A proteins regulate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis. eIF5A proteins are the only known proteins regulated by a distinct posttranslational modification termed hypusination, which is catalyzed by two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). The highly selective nature of the hypusine modification and its amenability to pharmacologic inhibition make eIF5A proteins attractive therapeutic targets. We found that the expression and hypusination of eIF5A proteins are upregulated in …

Here, we identify CRIPTO and its cell-surface receptor GRP78 as regulators of stem cell behavior in isolated fetal and adult mammary epithelial cells. We develop a CRIPTO antagonist that promotes differentiation and reduces self-renewal of mammary stem cell-enriched populations cultured ex vivo. By contrast, CRIPTO treatment maintains the stem cell phenotype in these cultures and yields colonies with enhanced mammary gland reconstitution capacity. Surface expression of GRP78 marks CRIPTO-responsive, stem cell-enriched fetal and adult mammary epithelial cells, and deletion of GRP78 from adult mammary epithelial cells blocks their mammary gland reconstitution potential. Together, these findings identify the CRIPTO/GRP78 pathway as a developmentally conserved regulator of fetal and adult mammary … 
Jonathan Kelber|Designer TGFβ superfamily ligands with diversified functionality|George P Allendorph, Jessica D Read, Yasuhiko Kawakami, Jonathan A Kelber, Michael J Isaacs, Senyon Choe|2011/11/4|PLoS One|6|11|e26402|Public Library of Science|Transforming Growth Factor – beta (TGFβ) superfamily ligands, including Activins, Growth and Differentiation Factors (GDFs), and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), are excellent targets for protein-based therapeutics because of their pervasiveness in numerous developmental and cellular processes. We developed a strategy termed RASCH (Random Assembly of Segmental Chimera and Heteromer), to engineer chemically-refoldable TGFβ superfamily ligands with unique signaling properties. One of these engineered ligands, AB208, created from Activin-βA and BMP-2 sequences, exhibits the refolding characteristics of BMP-2 while possessing Activin-like signaling attributes. Further, we find several additional ligands, AB204, AB211, and AB215, which initiate the intracellular Smad1-mediated signaling pathways more strongly than BMP-2 but show no sensitivity to the natural BMP antagonist Noggin unlike natural BMP-2. In another design, incorporation of a short N-terminal segment from BMP-2 was sufficient to enable chemical refolding of BMP-9, without which was never produced nor refolded. Our studies show that the RASCH strategy enables us to expand the functional repertoire of TGFβ superfamily ligands through development of novel chimeric TGFβ ligands with diverse biological and clinical values. 
Jonathan Kelber|Identification of a PEAK1/ZEB1 signaling axis during TGFβ/fibronectin-induced EMT in breast cancer|M Agajanian, F Runa, JA Kelber|2015|BBRC|||||Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) is the archetypal member of the TGFβ superfamily of ligands and has pleiotropic functions during normal development, adult tissue homeostasis and pathophysiological processes such as cancer. In epithelial cancers TGFβ signaling can either suppress tumor growth or promote metastasis via the induction of a well-characterized epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. We recently reported that PEAK1 kinase mediates signaling cross talk between TGFβ receptors and integrin/Src/MAPK pathways and functions as a critical molecular regulator of TGFβ-induced breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, EMT and metastasis. Here, we examined the breast cancer cell contexts in which TGFβ induces both EMT and PEAK1, and discovered this event to be unique to oncogene-transformed mammary epithelial cells and triple-negative breast cancer cells. Using the … 
Jonathan Kelber|PEAK1 Acts as a Molecular Switch to Regulate Context-Dependent TGFβ Responses in Breast Cancer|M Agajanian, A Campeau, M Hoover, A Hou, D Brambilla, SL Kim, RL Klemke, JA Kelber|2015/8/12|PLoS ONE|10|8|||Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) has dual functions as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of cancer progression within the tumor microenvironment, but the molecular mechanisms by which TGFβ signaling switches between these outcomes and the contexts in which this switch occurs remain to be fully elucidated. We previously identified PEAK1 as a new non-receptor tyrosine kinase that associates with the cytoskeleton, and facilitates signaling of HER2/Src complexes. We also showed PEAK1 functions downstream of KRas to promote tumor growth, metastasis and therapy resistance using preclinical in vivo models of human tumor progression. In the current study, we analyzed PEAK1 expression in human breast cancer samples and found PEAK1 levels correlate with mesenchymal gene expression, poor cellular differentiation and disease relapse. At the cellular level, we also observed that PEAK1 expression was highest in mesenchymal breast cancer cells, correlated with migration potential and increased in response to TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thus, we sought to evaluate the role of PEAK1 in the switching of TGFβ from a tumor suppressing to tumor promoting factor. Notably, we discovered that high PEAK1 expression causes TGFβ to lose its anti-proliferative effects, and potentiates TGFβ-induced proliferation, EMT, cell migration and tumor metastasis in a fibronectin-dependent fashion. In the presence of fibronectin, PEAK1 caused a switching of TGFβ signaling from its canonical Smad2/3 pathway to non-canonical Src and MAPK signaling. This report is the first to provide evidence that PEAK1 …

Although eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling contributes to multiple aggressive cancer cell phenotypes, the downstream signaling processes that mediate these responses are uncharacterized. Through proteomics and informatic analyses of PEAK1-depleted PDAC cells, we defined protein translation, cytoskeleton organization, and cell-cycle regulatory pathways as major pathways controlled by PEAK1. Biochemical and functional studies revealed that the transcription factors YAP1 and TAZ are key targets of eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling. YAP1/TAZ coimmunoprecipitated with PEAK1. Interfering with eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling in PDAC cells inhibited YAP/TAZ protein expression …

While this number is less than originally predicted [1], it constitutes almost 2% of the entire human genome [2]. Because kinases are integral to almost all signaling processes in eukaryotic cells via their role as posttranslational modifiers, it is crucial to identify and characterize their molecular and functional properties in order to more fully understand human physiology and disease. For example, kinases play central roles in cellular processes ranging from cell-cycle progression to cell motility to cell differentiation, and their proper function controls development and homeostasis in the adult [3-8]. Additionally, dysregulation of kinase genes accounts for the origin of many human diseases, making them an important family of genes to comprehensively understand-possibly leading to novel … 
Jonathan Kelber|Cellular and Molecular Aspects of Pancreatic cancer|Armen Gharibi, Yvess Adamian, Jonathan Kelber|2016/2/8|Acta Histochemica||||Elsevier|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy that affects nearly 50,000 patients each year. The overall 5-year survival rate for this malignancy remains the lowest of any cancer at around 7% due to limited diagnostic methods, disease aggressiveness and a lack of targeted therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the successes achieved over the past several decades as well as the significant cellular and molecular hurdles that remain in combatting this deadly disease at a translational level.

Here, we report that high expression of CRIPTO correlates with poor survival in stratified risk groups of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. CRIPTO and its signaling partner glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) are highly expressed in PCa metastases and display higher levels in the metastatic ALDH high sub-population of PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells compared with non-metastatic ALDH low. Coculture of the osteotropic PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells with differentiated primary human osteoblasts induced CRIPTO and GRP78 expression in cancer cells and increases the size of the ALDH high sub-population. Additionally, CRIPTO or GRP78 knockdown decreases proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and the size of the metastasis-initiating ALDH high sub-population. CRIPTO knockdown reduces the invasion of …

Katz, Jason Fleming, Robert M. Hoffman, Michael Bouvet, Robert Doebler, Jonathan A. Kelber|2016|Oncotarget||||Impact Journals|Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify and validate new biomarkers of cancer onset, progression and therapy resistance. Substantial archives of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples from patients represent a rich resource for linking molecular signatures to clinical data. However, performing NGS on FFPE samples is limited by poor RNA purification methods. To address this hurdle, we developed an improved methodology for extracting high-quality RNA from FFPE samples. By briefly integrating a newly-designed micro-homogenizing (mH) tool with commercially available FFPE RNA extraction protocols, RNA recovery is increased by approximately 3-fold while maintaining standard A260/A280 ratios and RNA quality index (RQI) values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mH-purified FFPE RNAs are longer and of higher integrity. Previous studies have suggested that pancreatic … 
Jonathan Kelber|ITGA1 is a pre-malignant biomarker that promotes therapy resistance and metastatic potential in pancreatic cancer|Jonathan A. Kelber Armen Gharibi, Sa La Kim, Justin Molnar, Daniel Brambilla, Yvess Adamian, Malachia Hoover, Julie Hong, Joy Lin, Laurelin Wolfenden|2017/8/30|Scientific Reports||||Nature|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has single-digit 5-year survival rates at< 7%. There is a dire need to improve pre-malignant detection methods and identify new therapeutic targets for abrogating PDAC progression. To this end, we mined our previously published pseudopodium-enriched (PDE) protein/phosphoprotein datasets to identify novel PDAC-specific biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. We discovered that integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1) is frequently upregulated in pancreatic cancers and associated precursor lesions. Expression of ITGA1-specific collagens within the pancreatic cancer microenvironment significantly correlates with indicators of poor patient prognosis, and depleting ITGA1 from PDAC cells revealed that it is required for collagen-induced tumorigenic potential. Notably, collagen/ITGA1 signaling promotes the survival of ALDH1-positive stem-like cells and cooperates with TGFβ to drive …

Kelber|2017/10/30|Current Molecular Biology Reports||Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer|1-12|Springer|The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as an integral component of malignancies in breast and prostate tissues, contributing in confounding ways to tumor progression, metastasis, therapy resistance, and disease recurrence. Major components of the TME are immune cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Herein, we discuss the molecular and cellular heterogeneity within the TME and how this presents unique challenges and opportunities for treating breast and prostate cancers. 
Jonathan Kelber|Proteomic and biochemical methods to study the cytoskeletome|Richard L Klemke, Xinning Jiang, Sunkyu Choi, Jonathan A Kelber|2013||||203-218|Humana Press, Totowa, NJ|The cytoskeleton is fundamental to many cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. It is composed of actin, microtubules, intermediate filaments, and integrin cell surface receptors, which form focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix. These elements are highly integrated in the cell providing a rigid network of interconnected cables and protein scaffolds, which generate force and mechanical support to maintain cell shape and movement. However, the cytoskeleton is not just a simple compilation of static filaments that dictate cell adhesion and morphology—it is highly plastic with the inherent ability to assemble and disassemble in response to diverse and complex cellular cues. Thus, biochemical and proteomic methods are needed to better understand the cytoskeleton network and its dynamic signal transduction functions in health and disease. This chapter … 
Jonathan Kelber|Ascending the PEAK1 toward targeting TGFβ during cancer progression: Recent advances and future perspectives|Farhana Runa, Yvess Adamian, Jonathan A Kelber|2016|Cancer cell & microenvironment|3|1||NIH Public Access|Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Mortality in patients with solid, epithelial-derived tumors strongly correlates with disease stage and the systemic metastatic load. In such cancers, notable morphological and molecular changes have been attributed to cells as they pass through a continuum of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states and many of these changes are essential for metastasis. While cancer metastasis is a complex cascade that is regulated by cell-autonomous and microenvironmental influences, it is well-accepted that understanding and controlling metastatic disease is a viable method for increasing patient survival. In the past 5 years, the novel non-receptor tyrosine kinase PEAK1 has surfaced as a central regulator of tumor progression and metastasis in the context of solid, epithelial cancers. Here, we review this literature with a special focus on our recent work …

However, it is also a dynamic signaling scaffold that receives and transmits complex mechanosensing stimuli that regulate normal physiological and aberrant pathophysiological processes. Studying cytoskeletal functions in the cytoskeleton’s native state is inherently difficult due to its rigid and insoluble nature. This has severely limited detailed proteomic analyses of the complex protein networks that regulate the cytoskeleton. Here, we describe a purification method that enriches for the cytoskeleton and its associated proteins in their native state that is also compatible with current mass spectrometry-based protein detection methods. This method can be used for biochemical, fluorescence, and large-scale proteomic analyses of numerous cell types. Using this approach … 
Jonathan Kelber|The Actin Cytoskeleton|Jonathan A Kelber, Richard L Klemke|2011/5/18|Cellular Domains|||197|John Wiley & Sons|Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in the cell and is critical for survival of all organisms. It is necessary for many fundamental cellular processes including cell migration, axon pathfinding, differentiation, and proliferation (Richards and Cavalier-Smith 2005). On the other hand, improper regulation of actin contributes to numerous human diseases including developmental disorders, inflammation, and cancer (Richards and Cavalier-Smith 2005). Actin is a highly abundant protein in cells and is highly conserved throughout all eukaryotes (Erickson 2007). F-actin is composed of individual β-actin and γ-actin subunits polymerized into helical double-stranded filaments that are bundled into fibrous networks of cables to provide mechanical support, force generation, and transport of intracellular cargo. The F-actin cytoskeleton can be grouped into the following subcellular compartments: the membrane-associated cytoskeleton (including ruffles, filopodia, spikes, pseudopodia, and lamellapodia), the cortical actin rim, and internal stress fibers and cables (Pollard and Cooper 2009; Prasain and Stevens 2009; Fig. 12.1 A). The membrane cytoskeleton and stress fibers are made up of shorter F-actin structures, while the cortical actin rim is composed of long F-actin fibers bundled together (Heimann et al. 1999). The membrane actin cytoskeleton possesses a thickness of only a few nanometers and primarily regulates membrane architecture, allowing the cell membrane to adopt a dynamic nature. The cortical actin rim lies adjacent to and beneath the membrane actin cytoskeleton. This structure is composed of dense actin fibers and is modulated by …

Hamalian, Toni L. Uhlendorf, Lisa R. Banner, Jonathan A. Kelber|2019/4/30|Oncotarget|2019|10|3027-3039||Cancer metastasis is responsible for the clear majority of cancer-related deaths. Survival and expansion of cancer cells at secondary sites requires that these premetastatic microenvironments be primed by primary tumor cells and their secreted factors. Efforts to date have been limited by immune-deficient in vivo models and/or the need for finely-tuned analysis time points that reduce contributions from early-disseminating cancer cells. In this regard, we developed a tumor cell-free syngeneic breast cancer model for characterizing tumor cell secretome-mediated reprogramming of premetastatic tissues. We demonstrate that secretomes from metastatic breast cancer cells differentially regulate the lung and brain, promoting a tumor-supportive lung microenvironment with both elevated CD73 expression and decreased TNFα expression. Using in vitro models of CD73-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and …

We performed an unbiased screen for novel Cripto binding proteins using proteomics-based methods, and identified novel proteins including members of myosin II complexes, the actin cytoskeleton, the cellular stress response, and extracellular exosomes. We report that myosin II, and upstream ROCK1/2 activities are required for localization of Cripto to cytoplasm/membrane domains and its subsequent release into the conditioned media fraction of cultured cells. Functionally, we demonstrate that soluble Cripto (one-eyed pinhead in zebrafish) promotes proliferation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and stem cell-mediated wound healing in the zebrafish caudal fin model of …

We analyzed regulatory variation in a cross between laboratory and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Clustering and linkage analysis defined groups of coregulated genes and the loci involved in their regulation. Most expression differences mapped to trans-acting loci. Positional cloning and functional assays showed that polymorphisms in GPA1 and AMN1 affect expression of genes involved in pheromone response and daughter cell separation, respectively. We also asked whether particular classes of genes were more likely to contain trans-regulatory polymorphisms. Notably, transcription factors showed no enrichment, and trans-regulatory variation seems to be broadly dispersed across classes of genes with different molecular functions.

During thaw, trapped organic matter may become more accessible for microbial degradation and result in greenhouse gas emissions 4, 5. Despite recent advances in the use of molecular tools to study permafrost microbial communities 6, 7, 8, 9, their response to thaw remains unclear. Here we use deep metagenomic sequencing to determine the impact of thaw on microbial phylogenetic and functional genes, and relate these data to measurements of methane emissions. Metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA from the environment, allows the examination of whole biochemical pathways and associated processes, as opposed to …

Here our aim was to determine the functional role of the Oceanospirillales and other active members of the indigenous microbial community using deep sequencing of community DNA and RNA, as well as single-cell genomics. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing revealed that genes for motility, chemotaxis and aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation were significantly enriched and expressed in the hydrocarbon plume samples compared with uncontaminated seawater collected from plume depth. In contrast, although …

The meeting was entitled “Terabase Metagenomics” and was sponsored by the Institute for Computing in Science (ICiS) summer 2010 workshop program. The aim of the workshop was to explore the fundamental questions relating to microbial ecology that could be addressed using advances in sequencing potential. Technological advances in next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina HiSeq 2000 can generate in excess of 250 billion base pairs of genetic information in 8 days. Thus, the generation of a trillion base pairs of genetic information is becoming a routine matter. The main outcome from this meeting was the birth of a concept and practical approach to exploring microbial life on earth, the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP). Here we briefly describe the highlights of this meeting and provide an overview of the EMP concept and how it can be applied to exploration of the microbiome of each ecosystem on this planet.

This process is largely dependent on microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the identities and functional gene composition of microorganisms in some permafrost soils 2, 3, 4 and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw experiments 3.

Taking into account the total mass of perennially frozen sediment (up to several hundred meters deep), permafrost contains a huge amount of buried, ancient organic carbon (Tarnocai et al., 2009). In addition, permafrost is warming rapidly in response to global climate change (Romanovsky et al., 2010), potentially leading to widespread thaw and a larger, seasonally thawed soil active layer. This concern has prompted the question: will permafrost thawing lead to the release of massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere? This question can only be answered by understanding how the microbes residing in permafrost will respond to thaw …

FOAM provides a new functional ontology dedicated to classify gene functions relevant to environmental microorganisms based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Sets of aligned protein sequences (i.e. ‘profiles’) were tailored to a large group of target KEGG Orthologs (KOs) from which HMMs were trained. The alignments were checked and curated to make them specific to the targeted KO. Within this process, sequence profiles were enriched with the most abundant sequences available to maximize the yield of accurate classifier models. An associated functional ontology was built to describe the functional groups and hierarchy. FOAM allows the user to select the target search space before HMM-based comparison steps and to easily …

Analysis of the relative allele frequency of these markers in human populations and the genetic associations between these markers, known as linkage disequilibrium, is now underway to generate a high‐density genetic map. Because of the central role T cells play in immune reactivity, the T‐cell receptor (TCR) loci have long been considered important candidates for common disease susceptibility within the immune system (e.g., asthma, atopy and autoimmunity). Over the past two decades, hundreds of SNPs in the TCR loci have been identified. Most studies have focused on defining SNPs in the variable gene segments which are involved in antigenic recognition.

Here we investigate the role of groundwater bacterial communities in the natural attenuation of DCM at an undisclosed manufacturing site in New Jersey. This study investigates the bacterial community structure of groundwater samples differentially contaminated with DCM to better understand the biodegradation potential of these autochthonous bacterial communities. Bacterial community analysis was completed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of groundwater samples (n= 26) with DCM contamination ranging from 0.89 to 9,800,000 µg/L. Significant DCM concentration-driven shifts in overall bacterial community structure were identified between samples, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes within the most contaminated samples. Across all samples, a total of 6,134 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, with 16 taxa having strong correlations with increased DCM concentration. Putative DCM degraders such as Pseudomonas, Dehalobacterium and Desulfovibrio were present within groundwater across all levels of DCM contamination. Interestingly, each of these taxa dominated specific DCM contamination ranges respectively. Potential DCM degrading lineages yet to be cited specifically as a DCM degrading organisms, such as the Desulfosporosinus, thrived within the most heavily contaminated groundwater samples.

Here, we analyze read connectivity in metagenomes and identify the presence of problematic and likely a-biological connectivity within metagenome assembly graphs. Specifically, we identify highly connected sequences which join a large proportion of reads within each real metagenome. These sequences show position-specific bias in shotgun reads, suggestive of sequencing artifacts, and are only minimally incorporated into contigs by assembly. The removal of these sequences prior to assembly results in similar assembly content for most metagenomes and enables the use of graph partitioning to decrease assembly memory and time requirements.

Only 1 to 2% of the original prairie remains, but the soils that developed under these prairies are some of the most productive and fertile in the world, containing over 35% of the soil carbon in the continental United States. Cultivation may alter microbial diversity and composition, influencing the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements. Here, we explored the structure and functional potential of the soil microbiome in paired cultivated-corn (at the time of sampling) and never-cultivated native prairie soils across a three-state transect (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas) using metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and lipid analysis. At the Wisconsin site, we also sampled adjacent restored prairie and switchgrass plots. We found that agricultural practices drove differences in community composition and diversity across the transect. Microbial biomass in prairie samples was twice that of cultivated soils, but alpha diversity was higher with cultivation. Metagenome analyses revealed denitrification and starch degradation genes were abundant across all soils, as were core genes involved in response to osmotic stress, resource transport, and environmental sensing. Together, these data indicate that cultivation shifted the microbiome in consistent ways across different regions of the prairie, but also suggest that many functions are resilient to changes caused by land management practices—perhaps reflecting adaptations to conditions common to tallgrass prairie soils in the region (e.g. soil type, parent material, development under grasses … 
Rachel Mackelprang|Illumina Sequencing Artifacts Revealed by Connectivity Analysis of Metagenomic Datasets|Adina Chuang Howe, Jason Pell, Rosangela Canino-Koning, Rachel Mackelprang, Susannah Tringe, Janet Jansson, James M Tiedje, C Titus Brown|2012/12|arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0159|||||Sequencing errors and biases in metagenomic datasets affect coverage-based assemblies and are often ignored during analysis. Here, we analyze read connectivity in metagenomes and identify the presence of problematic and likely a-biological connectivity within metagenome assembly graphs. Specifically, we identify highly connected sequences which join a large proportion of reads within each real metagenome. These sequences show position-specific bias in shotgun reads, suggestive of sequencing artifacts, and are only minimally incorporated into contigs by assembly. The removal of these sequences prior to assembly results in similar assembly content for most metagenomes and enables the use of graph partitioning to decrease assembly memory and time requirements. 
Rachel Mackelprang|Changes in the Active, Dead, and Dormant Microbial Community Structure Across a Pleistocene Permafrost Chronosequence|Alexander Burkert, Thomas A Douglas, Mark P Waldrop, Rachel Mackelprang|2019/4/1|Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|85|7|e02646-18|American Society for Microbiology|Permafrost hosts a community of microorganisms that survive and reproduce for millennia despite extreme environmental conditions, such as water stress, subzero temperatures, high salinity, and low nutrient availability. Many studies focused on permafrost microbial community composition use DNA-based methods, such as metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, these methods do not distinguish among active, dead, and dormant cells. This is of particular concern in ancient permafrost, where constant subzero temperatures preserve DNA from dead organisms and dormancy may be a common survival strategy. To circumvent this, we applied (i) LIVE/DEAD differential staining coupled with microscopy, (ii) endospore enrichment, and (iii) selective depletion of DNA from dead cells to permafrost microbial communities across a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence (19,000, 27,000, and 33,000 … 
Rachel Mackelprang|Frozen in Time? Metabolic Processes and Survival Strategies of Microbial Communities in Ancient Permafrost.|Rachel Mackelprang|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||One quarter of the earth's terrestrial surface is underlain by permafrost. Permafrost soils contain approximately 25-50% of the total global soil C pool, nearly double the atmospheric C reservoir. The C is largely protected from microbial decomposition by frozen conditions, but climate change is threating to induce large-scale permafrost thaw exposing it to degradation. The resulting production of globally significant quantities of greenhouse gasses (GHGs)---including CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O---is expected to result in a positive feedback loop thus amplifying the effects of global warming.

Using permafrost collected from a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence (19 ka to 33 ka), we hypothesized that increasing age and associated stressors drive adaptive changes in microbial community function and composition, and that functional changes in the metagenome would be related to changes in the chemistry of permafrost carbon (C). Examinations of water-soluble organic carbon (OC) by Fourier-transform ion-cyclotron-resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), quantification of total anions, and metagenomic sequencing were combined to better understand the relationships between microbial populations, the molecular-level composition of potentially bioavailable organic matter (OM), and age. We found that age had a marked effect on both the …

Microbial strategies for survival and carbon metabolism over geologic time in a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence|R Mackelprang, TA Douglas, MP Waldrop|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Permafrost soils have received tremendous interest due to their importance as a global carbon store with the potential to be thawed over the coming centuries. Instead of being'frozen in time,'permafrost contains active microbes. Most metagenomic studies have focused on Holocene aged permafrost. Here, we target Pleistocene aged ice and carbon rich permafrost (Yedoma), which can differ in carbon content and stage of decay. Our aim was to understand how microbes in the permafrost transform organic matter over geologic time and to identify physiological and biochemical adaptations that enable long-term survival. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize microbial communities along a permafrost age gradient. Samples were collected from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) Permafrost Tunnel near Fox, AK, which penetrates a hillside providing access to permafrost …

Although neural crest and cancer EMTs are morphologically similar, little is known regarding conservation of their underlying molecular mechanisms. We report that Sip1, which is involved in cancer EMT, plays a critical role in promoting the neural crest cell transition to a mesenchymal state. Sip1 transcripts are expressed in premigratory/migrating crest cells. After Sip1 loss, the neural crest specifier gene FoxD3 was abnormally retained in the dorsal neuroepithelium, whereas Sox10, which is normally required for emigration, was diminished. Subsequently, clumps of adherent neural crest cells remained adjacent to the neural tube and aberrantly expressed E-cadherin while lacking N-cadherin. These findings …

SoxB1 genes are down-regulated as cells exit the cell-cycle to differentiate and are considered functionally redundant in maintaining neural precursor populations. However, little is known about Sox3 function and its mode of action during primary neurogenesis. Using gain and loss-of-function studies, we analyzed Sox3 function in detail in Xenopus early neural development and compared it to that of Sox2. Through these studies we identified the first targets of a SoxB1 protein during primary neurogenesis. Sox3 functions as an activator to induce expression of the early neural genes, sox2 and geminin in the absence of protein synthesis and to indirectly inhibit the Bmp target Xvent2. As a result, Sox3 increases cell proliferation …

Herein, we review the molecules that directly antagonize extracellular BMP and the signaling pathways that further contribute to reduce BMP activity in the neural ectoderm. Downstream of neural induction, a large number of “neural fate stabilizing” (NFS) transcription factors are expressed in the presumptive neural ectoderm, developing neural tube and ultimately in neural stem cells. Herein, we review what is known about their activities during normal development to maintain a neural fate and regulate neural differentiation.

Crystal Rogers|Sox3 expression is maintained by FGF signaling and restricted to the neural plate by Vent proteins in the Xenopus embryo|Crystal D Rogers, Tenley C Archer, Doreen D Cunningham, Timothy C Grammer, Elena M Silva Casey|2008/1/1|Developmental biology|313|1|307-319|Academic Press|The formation of the nervous system is initiated when ectodermal cells adopt the neural fate. Studies in Xenopus demonstrate that inhibition of BMP results in the formation of neural tissue. However, the molecular mechanism driving the expression of early neural genes in response to this inhibition is unknown. Moreover, controversy remains regarding the sufficiency of BMP inhibition for neural induction. To address these questions, we performed a detailed analysis of the regulation of the soxB1 gene, sox3, one of the earliest genes expressed in the neuroectoderm. Using ectodermal explant assays, we analyzed the role of BMP, Wnt and FGF signaling in the regulation of sox3 and the closely related soxB1 gene, sox2. Our results demonstrate that both sox3 and sox2 are induced in response to BMP antagonism, but by distinct mechanisms and that the activation of both genes is independent of FGF signaling … 
Crystal Rogers|Neural crest specification: tissues, signals, and transcription factors|CD Rogers, CS Jayasena, S Nie, Marianne E Bronner|2012/1|Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology|1|1|52-68|John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|The neural crest is a transient population of multipotent and migratory cells unique to vertebrate embryos. Initially derived from the borders of the neural plate, these cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition to leave the central nervous system, migrate extensively in the periphery, and differentiate into numerous diverse derivatives. These include but are not limited to craniofacial cartilage, pigment cells, and peripheral neurons and glia. Attractive for their similarities to stem cells and metastatic cancer cells, neural crest cells are a popular model system for studying cell/tissue interactions and signaling factors that influence cell fate decisions and lineage transitions. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms required for neural crest formation in various vertebrate species, focusing on the importance of signaling factors from adjacent tissues and conserved gene regulatory interactions, which are required for … 
Crystal Rogers|The response of early neural genes to FGF signaling or inhibition of BMP indicate the absence of a conserved neural induction module|Crystal D Rogers, George S Ferzli, Elena S Casey|2011/12|BMC developmental biology|11|1|74|BioMed Central|The molecular mechanism that initiates the formation of the vertebrate central nervous system has long been debated. Studies in Xenopus and mouse demonstrate that inhibition of BMP signaling is sufficient to induce neural tissue in explants or ES cells respectively, whereas studies in chick argue that instructive FGF signaling is also required for the expression of neural genes. Although additional signals may be involved in neural induction and patterning, here we focus on the roles of BMP inhibition and FGF8a. To address the question of necessity and sufficiency of BMP inhibition and FGF signaling, we compared the temporal expression of the five earliest genes expressed in the neuroectoderm and determined their requirements for induction at the onset of neural plate formation in Xenopus. Our results demonstrate that the onset and peak of expression of the genes vary and that they have different regulatory requirements and are therefore unlikely to share a conserved neural induction regulatory module. Even though all require inhibition of BMP for expression, some also require FGF signaling; expression of the early-onset pan-neural genes sox2 and foxd5α requires FGF signaling while other early genes, sox3, geminin and zicr1 are induced by BMP inhibition alone. We demonstrate that BMP inhibition and FGF signaling induce neural genes independently of each other. Together our data indicate that although the spatiotemporal expression patterns of early neural genes are similar, the mechanisms involved in their expression are distinct and there are different signaling requirements for the expression of each gene.

Although Elk3 is expressed in various tissues, additional roles for the protein outside of vasculature development have yet to be reported. Here, we characterize the early spatiotemporal expression pattern of Elk3 in the avian embryo using whole mount in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR and examine the effects of its loss of function on neural crest development. At early stages, Elk3 is expressed in the head folds, head mesenchyme, intersomitic vessels, and migratory cranial neural crest (NC) cells. Loss of the Elk3 protein results in the retention of Pax7+ precursors in the dorsal neural tube that fail to upregulate neural crest specifier genes, FoxD3, Sox10 and Snail2, resulting in embryos with severe migration defects.

Crystal Rogers|Specifying neural crest cells: From chromatin to morphogens and factors in between|Crystal D Rogers, Shuyi Nie|2018/9|Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology|7|5|e322|John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|Neural crest (NC) cells are a stem‐like multipotent population of progenitor cells that are present in vertebrate embryos, traveling to various regions in the developing organism. Known as the “fourth germ layer,” these cells originate in the ectoderm between the neural plate (NP), which will become the brain and spinal cord, and nonneural tissues that will become the skin and the sensory organs. NC cells can differentiate into more than 30 different derivatives in response to the appropriate signals including, but not limited to, craniofacial bone and cartilage, sensory nerves and ganglia, pigment cells, and connective tissue. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the induction and specification of NC cells include epigenetic control, multiple interactive and redundant transcriptional pathways, secreted signaling molecules, and adhesion molecules. NC cells are important not only because they transform …

Numerous cadherin proteins, including neural cadherin (Ncad) and epithelial cadherin (Ecad), are expressed in the developing neural plate as well as in neural crest cells as they delaminate from the newly closed neural tube. To clarify independent or coordinate function during development, we examined their expression in the cranial region. The results revealed surprising overlap and distinct localization of Ecad and Ncad in the neural tube. Using a proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Ncad and Ecad formed heterotypic complexes in the developing neural tube, and that modulation of Ncad levels led to reciprocal gain or reduction of Ecad protein …

Crystal Rogers|The role of Sip1 in cranial neural crest development|Crystal Rogers, Marianne Bronner-Fraser|2011/8/1|Developmental Biology|356|1|238-239|Academic Press|To understand the mechanism of cerebellum (Cb) circuit formation we used two mouse alleles of the neurogenic gene Ascl1. First, to perform genetic inducible fate mapping (GIFM) we used an Ascl1CreER allele to specifically mark all neurons and glia that arise from the Cb ventricular zone (vz). Second, we used Ascl1 conditional allele to understand the role of Ascl1 in the generation of vz cell types. Using Ascl1CreER GIFM we found that each cell type has a unique temporal profile of Ascl1 expression and the final position each neuron type acquires differs depending on its Ascl1 expression. We found that Purkinje cells (Pcs), an early cohort of Bergmann glia, and four classes of GABAergic interneurons can be genetically birthdated using Ascl1CreER GIFM. In contrast, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were marked during their proliferative phase. We found that Pcs have distinct striped settling patterns depending on the day they express Ascl1, whereas interneurons (including candelabrum) attain a more outside position the later they express Ascl1. Mice lacking Ascl1 in the Cb have a major decrease in interneurons, a slight reduction in Pcs, and an imbalance of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Furthermore, Ascl1 is preferentially required in the latest born interneurons (stellate cells). Moreover, by fate mapping vz-derived cells in Ascl1 mutants, we found that Ascl1 plays a distinct role in restricting vz progenitors destined to become Pcs from becoming rhombic lip progenitors. In conclusion, our GIFM and mutant studies suggest an attractive model for Cb circuit formation, where target cells are created before regulatory cells, as well as a role for …

Crystal Rogers|The balance between N-cadherin and E-cadherin orchestrates major neuroectodermal cell fate choices|CD Rogers, L Sorrells Smith, ME Bronner|2016|Molecular Biology of the Cell|27||Art. No. P762|American Society for Cell Biology|Numerous cadherin proteins, including N‐cadherin (Ncad), E‐cadherin (Ecad), Cadherin‐11 (Cad11) and Cadherin‐7 (Cad7), are expressed in the developing neural plate as well as in neural crest cells as they delaminate from the newly closed neural tube. To clarify whether these proteins function independently or coordinately during development, we examined their relative expression in the cranial region of chick embryos. The results revealed surprising overlap of Ecad, Ncad and Cad7 in the neural tube, suggesting possible heterotypic interactions. Using a proximity ligation assay and co‐immunoprecipitation to test this hypothesis, we found that Ncad formed heterophilic complexes in the developing neural tube with Ecad. We also determined that modulation of either Ncad or Ecad levels led to reciprocal gain or reduction of the other cadherin protein. Altering levels of the two cadherin proteins affected the early fate specification of ectodermal derivatives, forcing an aberrant choice between neural crest and epidermal cells. Finally, we identified that the availability of β‐catenin plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between Ncad and Ecad in early development since co‐expression of activated β‐catenin rescues the Ncad‐overexpression phenotype. These results suggest that β‐catenin‐mediated balance of Ncad and Ecad proteins is critical for the normal development of the three ectodermal derivatives.

Crystal Rogers|Program/Abstract# 95 Evolution of SoxB1 regulation and function: Neural development from marine worm to frog|Crystal D Rogers, Doreen D Cunningham, Elena M Silva Casey|||||||SoxB1 transcription factors are encoded by early neural genes expressed in a subset of ectoderm cells that are directed to become proliferating neural progenitors. Expression of proneural proteins then drives the progenitors to exit the cell cycle, decrease the expression of the SoxB1 genes and differentiate into neurons to form the central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, although the basic organization of the CNS in vertebrates is conserved, the pathways driving induction and differentiation vary, making it difficult to identify an ancestral molecular mechanism. To define these basal mechanisms, we will study the regulation and function of the highly conserved SoxB1 transcription factors in organisms with a simple nervous system—the hemichordate, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and the urochordate, Ciona intestinalis, and compare this to what we and others have found in the vertebrate, Xenopus laevis. We have begun to investigate their role in neural development by using gain and loss of function experiments of SoxB1 proteins from Xenopus, Ciona and Saccoglossus in Xenopus and Ciona embryos. Also we are comparing the neural induction mechanisms by studying the regulation of the SoxB1 genes in Ciona and Xenopus. With this approach we can determine which mechanism is ancestral and if the functions of the proteins involved in neural development are conserved. doi: 10.1016/j. ydbio. 2008.05. 106

In the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, the historical notion is that color change is regulated by circadian rhythms. In this study, color patterns of U. pugilator were affected by changes in temperature; crab carapaces become light in warm temperatures and dark in colder temperatures. The response to temperature occurred within 15 min (often within 5 min of exposure to the treatment), suggesting that temperature may play a key role in color change, and it is activated not through a hormonal pathway, but rather a direct response of the chromatophores. Color change occurred differently between day and night for each sex, which implies that endogenous rhythms are not the sole mechanism for color change in U. pugilator. Both sexes became darker in the cold treatment, however … 
Nyssa Silbiger|Reefs shift from net accretion to net erosion along a natural environmental gradient|Nyssa J Silbiger, Òscar Guadayol, Florence IM Thomas, Megan J Donahue|2014/11/18|Marine Ecology Progress Series|515||33-44||Coral reefs persist in an accretion-erosion balance and ocean acidification resulting from anthropogenic CO 2 emissions threatens to shift this balance in favor of net reef erosion. Corals and calcifying algae, largely responsible for reef accretion, are vulnerable to environmental changes associated with ocean acidification, but the direct effects of lower pH on reef erosion has received less attention, particularly in the context of known drivers of bioerosion and natural variability. This study examines the balance between reef accretion and erosion along a well-characterized natural environmental gradient in Kāne ‘ohe Bay, Hawai ‘i using experimental blocks of coral skeleton. Comparing before and after micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans to quantify net accretion and erosion, we show that, at the small spatial scale of this study (tens of meters), pH was a better predictor of the accretion-erosion balance than environmental drivers suggested by prior studies, including resource availability, temperature, distance from shore, or depth. In addition, this study highlights the fine-scale variation of pH in coastal systems and the importance of microhabitat variation for reef accretion and erosion processes. We demonstrate significant changes in both the mean and variance of pH on the order of meters, providing a local perspective on global increases in pCO 2. Our findings suggest that increases in reef erosion, combined with expected decreases in calcification, will accelerate the shift of coral reefs to an erosion-dominated system in a high-CO 2 world. This shift will make reefs increasingly susceptible to storm damage and sea-level rise, threatening the …

As new tools allow the in situ exploration of individual responses to fluctuations, ecologically meaningful ways of characterizing environmental variability at organism scales are needed. We investigated the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of high-frequency temporal variability in temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH experienced by benthic organisms in a shallow coastal coral reef. We used a spatio-temporal sampling design, consisting of 21 short-term time-series located along a reef flat-to-reef slope transect, coupled to a long-term station monitoring water column changes. Spectral analyses revealed sharp gradients in variance decomposed by frequency, as well as differences between physically-driven and biologically-reactive parameters. These results highlight the importance of environmental variance at organismal scales and present a new sampling scheme for exploring this variability in situ.

Nyssa Silbiger|Fluorescent dissolved organic matter as a multivariate biogeochemical tracer of submarine groundwater discharge in coral reef ecosystems|Craig E Nelson, Megan J Donahue, Henrieta Dulaiova, Stuart J Goldberg, Florybeth F La Valle, Katie Lubarsky, Justin Miyano, Christina Richardson, Nyssa J Silbiger, Florence IM Thomas|2015/12/20|Marine Chemistry|177||232-243|Elsevier|In Hawaiʻi and other Pacific high islands submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can be a significant and continuous source of solutes to nearshore reefs and may play a key role in the structure and function of benthic coral and algal communities. Identifying SGD sources and linking them to reef biogeochemistry is technically challenging. Here we analyzed spectra of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) in coral reefs in the context of a suite of biogeochemical parameters along gradients of SGD to characterize fDOM composition and evaluate the utility of fDOM signatures in tracking groundwater dispersal and transformation. We spatially mapped water column chemistry in Maunalua Bay, Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi by collecting 24 water samples in grids at each of two ~ 0.15 km2 regions during both high and low tides over a two-day period. We observed clear horizontal gradients in the majority of 15 measured … 
Nyssa Silbiger|Secondary calcification and dissolution respond differently to future ocean conditions|NJ Silbiger, MJ Donahue|2015/1/29|Biogeosciences|12|2|567-578|Copernicus GmbH|Climate change threatens both the accretion and erosion processes that sustain coral reefs. Secondary calcification, bioerosion, and reef dissolution are integral to the structural complexity and long-term persistence of coral reefs, yet these processes have received less research attention than reef accretion by corals. In this study, we use climate scenarios from RCP 8.5 to examine the combined effects of rising ocean acidity and sea surface temperature (SST) on both secondary calcification and dissolution rates of a natural coral rubble community using a flow-through aquarium system. We found that secondary reef calcification and dissolution responded differently to the combined effect of pCO2 and temperature. Calcification had a non-linear response to the combined effect of pCO2 and temperature: the highest calcification rate occurred slightly above ambient conditions and the lowest calcification rate was in the highest temperature–pCO2 condition. In contrast, dissolution increased linearly with temperature–pCO2 . The rubble community switched from net calcification to net dissolution at +271 μatm pCO2 and 0.75 °C above ambient conditions, suggesting that rubble reefs may shift from net calcification to net dissolution before the end of the century. Our results indicate that (i) dissolution may be more sensitive to climate change than calcification and (ii) that calcification and dissolution have different functional responses to climate stressors; this highlights the need to study the effects of climate stressors on both calcification and dissolution to predict future changes in coral reefs.
