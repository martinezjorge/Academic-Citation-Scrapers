Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|It's a Nuisance: The Future of Fracking Litigation in the Wake of Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.|Hilary M Goldberg, Melanie Stallings Williams, Deborah Cours|2015|Va. Envtl. LJ|33||1||Hydraulic fracturing, or" fracking," is a polarizing topic, having earned both staunch advocates who see its possibilities for the domestic production of energy and ardent opponents who anticipate dire consequences resulting from its environmental impact. The practice has resulted in over one hundred lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, none of which have gone to verdict prior to the recent jury decision in Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc. 1 Because its result did not rest on a conclusion that the practice of fracking itself constituted a compensable wrong, Parr neither vindicated the oil and gas industry by exonerating it nor validated critics of fracking. Instead, the decision, based on a single cause of action of intentional private nuisance, demonstrated that juries were willing to find in favor of private plaintiffs even without a showing that fracking itself resulted in direct harm to the lives and property of those living nearby. The jury … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|On Parr: The Use and Propriety of Appraisal Methods in Computing Fracking Awards|Hilary M Golberg, Ray Calnan|2016|JL & Com.|35||55||Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc.,'made headlines in 2014 for being the first hydraulic fracturing (" Tracking") case to result in a jury verdict. In Parr, a Texas jury awarded $2.925 million to compensate the Parr family for injuries sustained resulting from Aruba Petroleum's nearby fracking activities. Of the nearly $3 million Parr verdict, later reversed on other grounds, the jury awarded $275,000 for diminution in property value. 2 Thanks to the fiercely litigated and highly publicized trial and appeal, scholars, practitioners and academics received a rare glimpse into an area of litigation otherwise insulated from public view by out of court resolutions and confidential settlement agreements. 3 In this interdisciplinary paper, we will provide an overview of the valuation process, addressing issues specific to diminution in value in the context of fracking and similar incidences of environmental contamination. We will then explain the … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|Disclosing the Inevitable: Reconciling the Varied Requirements for the Disclosure of Death on Real Property|Hilary M Goldberg|2018|Notre Dame JL Ethics & Pub. Pol'y|32||183||Whether or not a property owner is required to disclose to prospective purchasers a death, felony, or other traumatic event on her real property depends, almost entirely, upon where the property is located. Indeed, while many fundamental aspects of Real Estate Law are consistent nationwide, the requirements imposed upon sellers to disclose a death or other psychological element affecting the property vary by state. The proliferation and success of websites, such as DiedInHouse. com, which, for a fee, will provide a report of all deaths that occurred on a particular property, suggest that consumers nationwide want to know whether there has been a death on the property. Countless stories of perpetually vacant homes following notable deaths and violent crimes reinforce this notion. Is there any way to reconcile the competing interests of the buyer who is sensitive to the stigma and the seller facing potential diminution … 
Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|Stealing Time: The Propriety of Alleging Common Law Conversion in Modern Wage Theft Lawsuits|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg, Paul Silvia|2017||||||The words “wage theft” frequently make headlines when workers sue employers for underpayment or nonpayment of wages. Wage theft is “the illegal refusal by an employer to pay a worker the wages and benefits that he or she has legally earned.” In the United States, employer violation of wage and hour laws is a vast and enduring problem affecting as many as two-thirds of workers. In an attempt to combat this epidemic threat to hourly workers’ bottom lines, legislatures have fashioned numerous laws, some even invoking the power of “wage theft” terminology, such as New York’s Wage Theft Prevention Act. However, despite the pervasive usage of the term “wage theft” by the media, politicians, and pundits, a search of the term “wage theft” in legal libraries yields little precedent. This begs the question: can employers be liable for conversion for failing to compensate employees for time-spent working? The efficacy of conversion claims in wage-related lawsuits remains an unsettled question. However, if as a society, we are sounding the alarm in every incidence of possible wage and hour law violations, we ultimately misinform the population of potential plaintiffs regarding the viability of a claim for theft, or conversion, of earned yet unpaid wages.

Hilary Silvia-Goldberg|When Does Compensation for'Time Spent Under the Employer's Control'Include Pre and Post Shift Waiting and Other Activities?|Nanci Carr, Hilary Goldberg|2014/10/1|Southern Journal of Business & Ethics (October 2014)|||||In the face of continued economic uncertainly, employers are increasingly turning to temporary staffing to meet immediate workforce needs as a way of filling a current staffing gap without investing in a long-term commitment to an employee. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires that employers pay employees, including temporary employees, for all “hours worked,” so the question is what constitutes hours worked for the temporary worker? The answer generally comes down to “time spent under the employer’s control” but what does that mean? Does the employer need to exercise control over the employees’ choices, or just their actions? 
Chris Bolsmann |University ranking as social exclusion|Sarah S Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|2012/3/1|British journal of sociology of education|33|2|283-301|Routledge|In this article we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good' and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the … 
Chris Bolsmann |International student recruitment to universities in England: Discourse, rationales and globalisation|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|2008/3/1|Globalisation, Societies and Education|6|1|75-88|Routledge|The recruitment of international students to universities in England has become a central issue in an era of globalisation for university administrators, senior managers, international offices and heads of schools and faculties. We examine the policy rationales for the recruitment of international students to England. Through the use of in‐depth interviews with key role players at four English universities, we compare the rhetoric, rationales and reasons for the recruitment of international students. A range of discourses can be identified in the recruitment of international students and an economic competition rationale is dominant. This is expressed within the discourse of globalisation. 
Chris Bolsmann |Rationales, rhetoric and realities: FIFA’s World Cup in South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014|Bárbara Schausteck de Almeida, Chris Bolsmann, Wanderley Marchi Junior, Juliano de Souza|2015/5|International Review for the Sociology of Sport|50|3|265-282|SAGE Publications|The 2010 FIFA World Cup was heralded by mainstream media outlets, the local organisers, the South African government and FIFA as an unequivocal success. The month-long spectacle saw South Africa take centre stage and host the world’s largest single sporting event. This occurred against a backdrop of rationales and promises made that the event would leave lasting legacies for all, in particular marginalised South Africans. The reality is quite different. In this article we consider the South African World Cup in the build up to Brazil 2014. We argue that the rationales and rhetoric are similar in both countries and suggest the reality for Brazil 2014 will be the same as South Africa 2010 in that the mega-event will be primarily funded by significant public investment, while the primary beneficiaries will be private capital and FIFA.

Chris Bolsmann |Soccer, South Africa and celebrity status: Mark Fish, popular culture and the post‐apartheid state|Chris Bolsmann, Andrew Parker|2007/1/1|Soccer & Society|8|1|109-124|Routledge|The rise of celebrity culture is a theme that has attracted a significant amount of attention within both mainstream sociology and cultural studies in more recent times. Ensuing debate has identified contemporary sports figures as an important facet of the celebrity‐media nexus and as possible signifiers of cultural change. In this paper we take one particular sports celebrity, South African soccer star Mark Fish, and evaluate his image in relation to debates surrounding sport, politics and the post‐apartheid state. We argue that because Fish appears to enjoy all the benefits of celebrity status (within his home country at least), an analysis of his career and identity provide a useful means by which to think about the changing political and nationalistic values within South African society. 
Chris Bolsmann |White football in South Africa: Empire, apartheid and change, 1892–1977|Chris Bolsmann|2010/1/1|Soccer & Society|11|1-2|29-45|Routledge|This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more significant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth‐century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the first period under consideration (1892–1940s), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of … 
Chris Bolsmann |Africa's World Cup: critical reflections on play, patriotism, spectatorship, and space|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|2013/5/16|||||University of Michigan Press|Africa’s World Cup: Critical Reflections on Play, Patriotism, Spectatorship, and Spacefocuses on a remarkable month in the modern history of Africa and in the global history of football. Peter Alegi and Chris Bolsmann are well-known experts on South African football, and they have assembled an impressive team of local and international journalists, academics, and football experts to reflect on the 2010 World Cup and its broader significance, its meanings, complexities, and contradictions. The World Cup’s sounds, sights, and aesthetics are explored, along with questions of patriotism, nationalism, and spectatorship in Africa and around the world. Experts on urban design and communities write on how the presence of the World Cup worked to refashion urban spaces and negotiate the local struggles in the hosting cities. The volume is richly illustrated by authors’ photographs, and the essays in this volume feature chronicles of match day experiences; travelogues; ethnographies of fan cultures; analyses of print, broadcast, and electronic media coverage of the tournament; reflections on the World Cup’s private and public spaces; football exhibits in South African museums; and critiques of the World Cup’s processes of inclusion and exclusion, as well as its political and economic legacies. The volume concludes with a forum on the World Cup, including Thabo Dladla, Director of Soccer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Mohlomi Kekeletso Maubane, a well-known Soweto-based writer and a soccer researcher, and Rodney Reiners, former professional footballer and current chief soccer writer for the Cape Argus newspaper in Cape Town.

Chris Bolsmann |Representation in the first African World Cup:‘world-class’, Pan-Africanism, and exclusion|Chris Bolsmann|2012/3/1|Soccer & Society|13|2|156-172|Routledge|This paper explores the representation of the first African World Cup in the British and South African press. Drawing on the output of a variety of media outlets between 2004, when South Africa was awarded the right to host the 2010 event, and the culmination of the tournament in July 2010, this paper contends that a range of representations of Africa have been put forward by the British and South African media. These can be interpreted as alarmist, sensationalist and even racist in certain extreme instances, and hypernationalist and overly defensive in other cases. 
Chris Bolsmann |The 1899 Orange Free State football team tour of Europe:‘Race’, imperial loyalty and sporting contest|Chris Bolsmann|2011/1/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|28|1|81-97|Routledge|In September 1899 an association football team from Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, South Africa, arrived in the United Kingdom. The team comprised 16 black South Africans who played under the auspices of the whites-only Orange Free State Football Association and was the first ever South African football team to tour abroad. In a four-month tour the team played 49 matches against opposition in England, France, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. A small but growing body of work focuses on black sport and football in particular and the 1899 tour is referred to in passing in a few publications, although none have attempted to uncover details of the team or the matches that were played in Europe. This article attempts to do this by drawing on a range of sources in South Africa and the United Kingdom and argues the case for the significance of this team for football history in general and South African sports … 
Chris Bolsmann |Pre-empting the challenges of transformation and marketisation of higher education: a case study of the Rand Afrikaans University|Chris Bolsmann, Tina Uys|2001/7/1|Society in Transition|32|2|173-185|Taylor & Francis Group|With the advent of the marketisation of higher education and the change to a democratic dispensation, South African universities find themselves facing budgetary constraints that need to be reconciled with the transformation of previous bastions of elitism into institutions accommodating and representing all South Africans. The Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) was founded in 1967 to provide Christian National education for white working-class Afrikaans-speaking students and its first vice-chancellor was a leading member of the Broederbond. Although this ethos tended to dominate university policy and practices until fairly recently, the university has at the same time been involved in innovations with regard to teaching since its inception. This paper focuses on recent changes that have taken place at RAU. It analyses the role of marketisation in facilitating changes in the student composition and forms of delivery in … 
Chris Bolsmann |South Africa and the global game: Introduction|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|2010/1/1|Soccer & Society|11|1-2|1-11|Routledge|On 10 May 1994, the festivities for Nelson Mandela’s presidential inauguration included a soccer match between South Africa and Zambia at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. At halftime, Mandela’s helicopter landed on the pitch. As the president stepped out onto the grass, the huge crowd erupted in a thunderous roar. When play resumed, the South Africans seemed electrified and went on to win the match 2-1. On 15 May 2004 in Zurich, Switzerland, Mandela wept with joy when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) awarded South Africa the right to host the 2010 World Cup. South Africans celebrated in the streets as if they had not simply won hosting rights, but the World Cup itself!‘To some extent this outburst of euphoria surpassed 1994’, commented Ahmed Kathrada, the former political prisoner incarcerated with Mandela for 26 years;‘The scenes of jubilation, the spontaneous outpouring of … 
Chris Bolsmann |Mexico 1968 and South Africa 2010: development, leadership and legacies|Chris Bolsmann, Keith Brewster|2009/12/1|Sport in Society|12|10|1284-1298|Taylor & Francis Group|In this essay we compare the rationales for hosting the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City with the FIFA World Cup 2010 to be held in South Africa. We draw on in-depth interviews, archival materials and a range of press coverage. We argue that three broad overlapping themes are apparent in both case studies. These are the developmental rhetoric both hosts employ in the justification of holding the events in their respective countries. Mexico and South Africa convey a leadership role that stretches across the South American and African continent respectively. Finally, both countries argue that the legacy the respective tournament leaves is important. 
Chris Bolsmann |South African football tours at the turn of the twentieth century: Amateurs, pioneers and profits|Chris Bolsmann|2010/6/1|African Historical Review|42|1|91-112|Taylor & Francis Group|Academic and popular studies of South African sport generally reveal a bias towards cricket and rugby and this perpetuates the myth that these games are the most popular in South Africa. This in turn is often viewed through the lens of ‘race’ in which the simplifications of sport along racial lines occur. This paper argues that football was more important in South Africa among all South Africans in the late 19th and early 20th century than has been previously acknowledged. It reveals that not only was the game important and popular in South Africa but its teams and administrators played a significant role in globalising the game during this period. Tours to and from South Africa were important politically, financially and for sporting reasons. Five ground breaking football tours took place during a ten year period and these serve as the basis of discussion in this paper. 
Chris Bolsmann |From Apartheid to unity: White capital and black power in the racial integration of South African football, 1976–1992|Peter Alegi, Chris Bolsmann|2010/6/1|African Historical Review|42|1|1-18|Taylor & Francis Group|This article analyses the complex process that deracialised and democratised South African football between the early 1970s and 1990s. Based mainly on archival documents, it argues that growing isolation from world sport, exemplified by South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic movement in 1970 and FIFA in 1976, and the reinvigoration of the liberation struggle with the Soweto youth uprising triggered a process of gradual desegregation in the South African professional game. While Pretoria viewed such changes as a potential bulwark against rising black militancy, white football and big business had their own reasons for eventually supporting racial integration, as seen in the founding of the National Soccer League. As negotiations for a new democratic South Africa began in earnest between the African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP) in the latter half of the 1980s, transformations … 
Chris Bolsmann |Improving colorectal cancer screening: a partnership between primary care practices and the American Cancer Society|Michael B Potter, Yaser Namvargolian, Jimmy Hwang, Judith ME Walsh|2009/3/1|Journal of Cancer Education|24|1|22|Springer-Verlag|Background. The American Cancer Society (ACS) is interested in facilitating colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) in primary care. Methods. Similar clinics were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 CRCS arms: (1) usual care, (2) exam-room posters designed by the ACS; and (3) posters plus patient reminder calls from an ACS volunteer. Results. Compared to patients due for screening in Arm 1, the odds ratio for getting CRCS in Arm 2 was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–1.34), P value not significant; in Arm 3, it was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.16–1.90), P value < .001. Conclusions. Exam-room posters plus patient reminder calls from the ACS can increase CRCS in primary care. 
Chris Bolsmann |Professional Football in Apartheid South Africa: Leisure, Consumption and Identity in the National Football League, 1959–1977|Chris Bolsmann|2013/10/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|30|16|1947-1961|Routledge|A growing body of academic and popular literature considers the history of South African football. These and existing publications pay little or no attention to the emergence of white professional football in apartheid South Africa. The National Football League (NFL) challenged the amateur game and introduced professional football to the country. During its 17-year existence, the NFL grew each season with large attendances until its demise in 1977. In addition, the NFL imported a range of international players, invited foreign teams and actively engaged in the political debates in South African sport at the time. The NFL was instrumental in popularising the game across the country for all South Africans. The NFL became the most popular sports entertainment of choice for South Africans during this period. Finally, the NFL actively engaged in a campaign of destroying rival non-racial anti-apartheid leagues while … 
Chris Bolsmann |Mexico 1968 and South Africa 2010: Sombreros and Vuvuzelas and the Legitimisation of Global Sporting Events|Chris Bolsmann|2010/3|Bulletin of Latin American Research|29||93-106|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|I aim to demonstrate in this chapter the utility of comparing Mexico’s experience in 1968 with that of South Africa’s hosting of the 2010 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup and its precursor, the FIFA Confederations Cup staged in 2009. In large measure, South Africa’s preparations for hosting the 2010 World Cup presented similar hurdles to those confronted by Mexico 40 years earlier. What I believe this comparative approach reveals is that the two countries not only shared common experiences as a result of having to stage mega-sports-events, but that their experiences show similarities explicitly because they were viewed as somehow falling short of expectations set by the ‘Western world’. Additionally, as we shall see, the rare opportunity afforded the two states in hosting these events fostered a fundamental debate within each country concerning projection of itself and its role in the … 
Chris Bolsmann |Trade-union internationalism and solidarity in the struggle against apartheid: A Case Study of Volkswagen|Chris Bolsmann|2007/4/1|Historical Studies in Industrial Relations||23-24|103-124|Liverpool University Press|By the 1970s, the struggle against apartheid had intensified within South Africa and abroad. Eddie Webster has argued that this struggle ‘became the moral equivalent of the Spanish civil war… with democrats, liberals, communists and concerned Christians united in common abhorrence of white domination’. 1 This article focuses on the trade-union internationalism and solidarity that emerged between South African and German trade-unionists in the fight against apartheid in a major German trans-national corporation (TNC). The relationships that developed in terms of the overlapping and convergence of economic, political and institutional interests that inform actions are studied. 2 Two distinct phases are identified. First, the emergence in the latter part of the 1970s of direct shop-floor and official links between South African and German trade-unionists, informed by the economic and institutional interests of the … 
Chris Bolsmann |Globalisation, the market university and support service outsourcing in South Africa: Class struggle, convergence and difference, 1994–2001|Lucien van der Walt, Chris Bolsmann, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2003/7/1|Society in Transition|34|2|272-294|Taylor & Francis Group|‘Globalisation’ is all too often understood as a monolithic process that produces broadly similar outcomes in a wide range of settings. This examination of the impact of globalisation on the restructuring of public sector universities in South Africa in the 1990s demonstrates that the picture is far more complex. Over the last thirty years, globalisation has been intertwined with neoliberal capitalist economic and ideological restructuring. This is refracted, in the first instance, through State policy, and, in the second, through specific local sites of power relations and class struggles that are, in turn, structured by the resources and responses of different actors. While the neoliberal component of globalisation has played a decisive role in shaping State higher education policy in South Africa, the actual implementation of the model of the market-orientated university receiving minimal support from a deficit conscious State has … 
Chris Bolsmann |Contesting labor internationalism: The “old” trapped in the “new” in Volkswagen’s South African plant|Chris Bolsmann|2010/12|Labor Studies Journal|35|4|520-539|SAGE Publications|During the 1970s and 1980s, close linkages were established between unionists in Volkswagen’s Uitenhage plant in South Africa and Wolfsburg in Germany. The ensuing relationship resulted in trade union internationalism and solidarity with South African workers in their struggle against apartheid. After the insertion of the South African plant into the global production networks of the company, a range of new pressures and challenges confronted the union in South Africa. This resulted in the mass dismissal in 2000. In an attempt to garner international support and solidarity, the dismissed workers tapped into existing structures with no success, illustrating the reconfiguration of trade union internationalism away from worker interests to those of the unions and company. 
Chris Bolsmann |International student recruitment: South African rationales|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|2008|Journal of Higher Education in Africa/Revue de l'enseignement supérieur en Afrique|6|2-3|211-231|CODESRIA|In this paper, we focus on the rationales for the recruitment of international students to universities in South Africa. Through the use of in-depth interviews with international officers at a cross-section of South African universities, we argue that there are competing and complementary rationales for the recruitment of international students. Some South African universities follow international trends in terms of international student recruitment while others adopt a different approach. The analysis locates the rationales of international student recruitment as part of an internationalisation process within the context of globalisation. 
Chris Bolsmann |Dominions Apart: Scandal and Sporting Mismatch in Australian–South African Association Football Encounters, 1947–1955|Chris Bolsmann, Nick Guoth|2012/3/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|29|3|472-491|Routledge|South Africa, Australia and New Zealand participated in numerous sporting contests prior to World War Two. These encounters were primarily on cricket pitches and rugby fields. After nearly four decades of negotiations the first Association football matches were played between the three countries in 1947. The first tour of South Africa to Australia and New Zealand was plagued by scandals on and off the pitch, but despite this Australia returned the favour and toured South Africa three years later. Another five years would pass before South African returned to Australia, by which time it was clear that a large gulf had emerged between the two nations in terms of sporting ability and organisational efficiency. This article focuses on the three tours of 1947, 1950 and 1955, dissecting each as they occurred against a backdrop of scandal, organisational inefficiency and sporting mismatch.

Chris Bolsmann |“Why Play Cricket…?”: A Preliminary Analysis of Participation by Young Males|Martin Toms, Scott Fleming|1995/5/1||15|1|89-106|Taylor & Francis Group|For almost a decade there has been considerable debate and discussion about the roles and relative importance of school-based and club-based cricket in the development of elite young male cricketers;4 and state schools have often been accused of failing to provide Britain's youth with an adequate introduction to the fundamentals of the game.5 The recent Political intervention into debates about the place of team games in the schooling of young people has further fanned the flames, and in spite of the success of the England women's team, cricket is now, once again, in the spotlight. Indeed, so much so, that cricket has been identified by the Sports Council as a ‘focus sport’.6 
Chris Bolsmann |‘Here Come “Chelsea” of Sweden’: Djurgården Football Club on Tour in Apartheid South Africa|Hans Bolling, Chris Bolsmann|2013/9/1|Sport in History|33|3|353-372|Routledge|In this article we argue that while apartheid, boycotts and South African sport have received significant coverage and focus, this has primarily been restricted to Britain and former white colonies of the Commonwealth such as Australia and New Zealand. In addition, sports such as cricket and rugby receive most attention. We argue that it is useful to consider other countries and sports engaged in apartheid South Africa. We consider Swedish engagement with apartheid South Africa and focus the case study of our analysis on the tour by champions Djurgården to the country in 1955. The tourists received favourable and widespread support in South Africa and Sweden. Yet towards the end of the tour sections of the Swedish press asked critical and probing questions of the club's tour to South Africa. We contend that the tour can be viewed as naïve and apolitical and in a similar vein to the organization of Swedish sports … 
Chris Bolsmann |The Outsourced University|Lucien Van der Walt, C Bolsman, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|1994||2001|||A survey of the rise of support service outsourcing in public sector higher education in South African and its effects on workers and trade unions|The “transformation” of the public sector universities in post-apartheid South Africa remains at the centre of government’s political commitments, policy formation processes, and public debate. 1 Yet one aspect of university restructuring has received surprisingly little attention: the trend towards the outsourcing of support service functions in the 1990s. Although the conflicts arising from this process caught the public eye on a number of occasions, most notably the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the support services at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2000, there has been no thorough study of the rise and effects of support service outsourcing in South Africa. The few studies that exist tend to be brief, sometimes journalistic, and generally confined to an examination of a single institution. By comparison, issues such as curriculum restructuring, university governance,“marketisation” and the proposed mergers and disestablishment of a number of institutions have been the subject of a great deal of public analysis, not to mention political conflict. 2 This paper provides an overview of the process of support service outsourcing across the public sector universities, and examines the effects of this process on workers and their trade unions. Our focus is on the period 1994 to 2001. By support services, we refer, in particular, to those manual and menial campus occupations that do not contribute directly towards knowledge production but which are, nonetheless, essential to the functioning of the universities. These occupations include catering, cleaning, grounds and building maintenance, security services and transport. The paper situates this … 
Chris Bolsmann |Taking South African sport seriously|Chris Bolsmann, Cora Burnett|2015/1/2||46|1|1-6|Routledge|Twenty years on, the image of Nelson Mandela, wearing the number six jersey of the white Springbok captain, Francois Pienaar, remains a poignant moment in South African and global sport. The 1995 Rugby World Cup victory by the overwhelmingly all-white Springboks remains a powerful symbol in post-apartheid South Africa. Clint Eastwood’s (2009) Hollywood film, Invictus, based on John Carlin’s Playing the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that made a nation (2008), has dramatised the significance of Mandela wearing the jersey and the South African victory. The formerly exclusive symbol was seemingly appropriated and made socially inclusive and became part of the lexicon and rhetoric of nation building post-1994. For Ashwin Desai (2010: 1), rugby had become ‘the sport that would help to catalyse the building of a “rainbow nation” predicated on a common identity, a common sense of “South … 
Chris Bolsmann |A copa do mundo Fifa na África do Sul/2010–como foi a experiência e o que podemos aprender com ela?|Wanderley Marchi Júnior, Chris Bolsmann, Bárbara Schausteck de Almeida, Juliano de Souza|2014|Movimento|20|2||Escola de Educação Física|In this essay, we intend to discuss some social logics not explicit that articulate the domain of the FIFA World Cup. Therefore, the 2010 edition of this event is used as analytical approach to reveal some of the rhetoric and strategic actions that permeated the context of its realization. Based on data obtained in the academic literature and media, we present that the motivations for the event were based on developmental discourses by both FIFA as well as local elites South African aiming to convince different social groups and conquer their support. However, the consequences are not necessarily those promised, and these institutions were the real benefciaries in their economic and political mutual interests. At this point, we argue that Brazilian society can and should learn from the experience of South Africa to assess critically the motives less apparent to host such events. Key-words: Mega-events.

Chris Bolsmann |Solidarity and Identity: Volkswagen Workers in South Africa and Germany|Chris Bolsmann|2006|Globalisation and new identities: A view from the middle|||137-55|Jacana Media|THE FOCUS OF this chapter is on worker identity within a trans-national corporation (TNC). This is related to international trade union solidarity, within Volkswagen AG'(VWAG). The connections between identity and solidarity are complex and the two ideas cannot be regarded as synonymous; rather they influence each other during two different periods under consideration. The chapter traces the 20 year relationship and solidarity displayed between the two trade unions organising in Germany and South Africa respectively, namely IG MetalP and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA). The first contact was initiated in the late 1970s and the ensuing links have developed over the last two decades. The central claim of this chapter is that two broad overlapping periods of interaction can be identified. The nature of these relations affects the forms of solidarity displayed by participants and the manner in which they relate to and interact with one another in terms of trade union internationalism. In the first section of this chapter, the analytical framework for understanding solidarity is explored. Solidarity is understood as action that benefits Volkswagen of South Africa (VWSA) employees and trade unionists and broader activity against the apartheid state. This is interpreted against the backdrop of a specific form of trade union internationalism during apartheid. In the second section, specific themes related to the above periods which emerged from semi structured in- 
Chris Bolsmann |White football in South Africa: empire, apartheid and change, 1892—1977|Chris Bolsmann|2013/10/18|South Africa and the Global Game: Football, Apartheid and Beyond|||29|Routledge|This essay traces the development, domination and decline of white football in South Africa. It suggests that white football was more signiﬁcant and popular than generally acknowledged and was at the forefront of globalizing football in the early twentieth century. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth-century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. This historical analysis of elite white football draws from the archives of the Football Association of South Africa. The analysis underscores the important role of white football authorities in the contestation of power and identity in the game in South Africa and abroad. In the ﬁrst period under consideration (1892—19405), local football authorities challenged the dominant sports within South Africa. This period was followed in the 1950s by the challenges of professionalism and antiapartheid organizations. In the ﬁnal phase (1967—77), ofﬁcials experimented with football on ‘multi-national’and multi-racial lines—a failed reform that led to the demise of white football. This essay traces the development, domination and decline of organized white football in South Africa. 1 It suggests that white football was more signiﬁcant and popular than generally acknowledged. In order to better understand the broader history of twentieth-century South African football, a more detailed examination of the organized white game at the national and international levels is necessary. 2 The objective of this analysis is to highlight three main periods of elite white football and reveal a number of contradictions along …

Chris Bolsmann |Review Essay on Peter Alegi, Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa|Chris Bolsmann|2006/4/1|Soccer & Society|7|2-3|292-299|Routledge|With the readmission of South African football into the international fold in 1992, a new phase began in the nation’s sporting history. In football, the euphoria continued with the national team winning the 1996 African Cup of Nations and participating in two World Cups in France in 1998 and Japan and South Korea in 2002. In addition to staging the 1996 African Cup of Nations, the most important football competition, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the country in 2010. Despite the abovementioned successes, relatively few studies have focussed on South African football. Mark Gleeson, South Africa’s foremost football writer and commentator, notes in his forward to the book Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa that ‘a general apathy with regard to the history of sport and its role in the development of South African society has ensured that this country does not possess a formal history of its football … 
Chris Bolsmann |Globalisation and the Outsourced University in South Africa|Lucien Van der Walt, C Bolsman, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2002/7|Final Report for CHET. University of Witwatersrand|||||The “transformation” of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has been a key focus of the new government’s reformist policy initiatives. On the one hand, the government has sought to break down racialised divisions in the sector between Historically Advantaged Institutions (HAIs) and Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs), to make the staff and student bodies more “representative” of the country as a whole, and to make the universities more accountable to its national and developmental priorities. On the other hand, government’s initiatives have taken place within the dual constraints of its own conservative macro-economic policy model, embodied in the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (GEAR), and the broader challenges imposed by neo-liberal globalisation. Within this context, the transformation of public sector universities in the post-apartheid period has not proceeded in a smooth or monolithic manner. Rather, there have been many transformations, with different winners and losers, in the sector over the past decade, transformations shaped by the new global ideology of university “marketisation,” by the fiscal constraints of government’s macro-economic policy, by continued divisions between HAIs ands HDIs, and by divisions within universities by race and class and occupation. In this research paper, we examine one of these transformations: the restructuring and outsourcing of university support service functions in the 1990s. Even if some of the conflicts that have arisen from this process have caught the public eye-notably during the controversial restructuring of support services at the University of the … 
Chris Bolsmann |English Gentlemen and World Soccer: Corinthians, Amateurism and the Global Game|Chris Bolsmann, Dilwyn Porter|2018/4/19|||||Routledge|Association football is a global phenomenon. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), its governing body, currently has 211 countries in membership. In 2014, the sixty-four matches played by the thirty-two national teams competing in the final stages of the World Cup tournament in Brazil attracted a total attendance of almost 3.5 million spectators while reaching an estimated 2.1 billion television viewers worldwide.‘Soccer’, as we shall mostly call it so as to distinguish it from other forms of football, has come a long way from Kennington Oval, London, where the first international match was contested between England and Scotland in 1872 in front of 2,500 enthusiasts. 1 It was once commonplace to argue that it spread from Britain to the rest of the world by a relatively uncomplicated process

A Continental Spectacle?|Chris Bolsmann|2014/4/30||||372-388|Wallstein Verlag|The iconic image of former South African President Nelson Mandela holding the FIFA World Cup trophy is indelibly etched into the collective memory of football-loving South Africans and citizens across the globe. The photograph was taken at the headquarters of FIFA overlooking the city of Zurich on 15 May 2004. Mandela’s instantly recognisable smile adorned television screens and newspapers across the globe as FIFA announced that the hosts of the 2010 World Cup would be South Africa. 1 An African host was guaranteed the showpiece event after the controversial and contested decision to grant Germany the right to host the 2006 tournament. Despite South Africa being favourites to land the 2010 event, this was not guaranteed. The awarding of the 2010 event to South Africa was long-overdue recognition of Africa’s contribution to the world’s game. It represented an affirmation that an African host could stage … 
Chris Bolsmann |Sport and Post-Apartheid South Africa: Revisiting The Race Game|Chris Bolsmann|2014|Journal of Sport History|41|2|331-338|University of Illinois Press|In 1999, Douglas Booth’s The Race Game: Sport and Politics in South Africa was awarded the North American Society for Sport History book award. 1 The Race Game remains an essential text that considers sport and politics in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. Twenty years on from the first free and fair democratic elections in South Africa, sport remains a useful lens, in terms of transformation and redress, through which to consider South African society more broadly. Booth noted early in The Race Game that “segregated sport was one of the most visible racial policies” in pre-1994 South Africa (p. 4). Issues of legislated discrimination and segregation no longer beset South African sport, yet race in sport remains an important component of South African society more broadly

Therefore, the 2010 edition of this event is used as analytical approach to reveal some of the rhetoric and strategic actions that permeated the context of its realization. Based on data obtained in the academic literature and media, we present that the motivations for the event were based on developmental discourses by both FIFA as well as local elites South African aiming to convince different social groups and conquer their support. However, the consequences are not necessarily those promised, and these institutions were the real beneficiaries in their economic and political mutual interests. At this point, we argue that Brazilian society can and should learn from the experience of South Africa south africa Subject Category: Geographic Entities

Consequently, before the 2010 World Cup, South Africa still remained a closed book to many. Only a few journalists and researchers have bucked the trend, writing about African football in its entirety. Before the World Cup, Peter Alegi, probably the foremost historian of African football, gathered a panel of journalists and researchers to discuss the significance of the World Cup for the African continent. Their comments in January 2010, as recorded here for this special FIFA World Cup 2010 edition of Ecquid Novi: African …

The club’s posturing on the day, and in its efforts more broadly, was that it offered the local market something new. Yet while the claim to originality was a tacit acknowledgment that the city had a footballing past, rarely has this past been explored in the relevant historiography. Thus, the founding of LAFC presents a timely moment to fill in the scholarly gap. This article uses LAFC as an entry point for exploring the contours of professional soccer in Los Angeles over the previous half-century. It follows three sides—the Los Angeles Aztecs, Los Angeles Galaxy, and Los Angeles Football Club—in their attempts to navigate the city’s built and sociocultural environment.

Though the original club appears to have had little impact on the way the game is played today, its characteristic style and tactics having been developed before the change in the offside law in 1925, some long-term influences are discernible in the continuing importance attached to sportsmanlike behaviour. While on tour in England but also in Europe, South Africa, the United States, Canada and Brazil, the Corinthians were effectively an advertisement for the patrician brand of soccer that they had offered in their late nineteenth-century heyday under ‘Pa’ Jackson.

In 1878, the DFA introduced a Challenge Cup competition, only seven years after the Football Association (FA) Challenge Cup had been first played for in England. 6 At the same time, soccer was growing in the north-eastern industrial centres of the United States, primarily Kearny and Harrison in New Jersey, Fall River and New Bedford in Massachusetts and Pawtucket in Rhode Island.

During his career, Jackson exhibited many of the qualities often attributed to entrepreneurs. He was an outsider, the son of a cheesemonger, who affected the gentility required to do business with the rich and famous; he was an opportunist who made connections between sports and sportsrelated activities to create new products; he was a publicist who recognized instinctively the value of a distinctive brand. Much of this was evident from the notice published in Football in October 1882, announcing the arrival of ‘A NEW ASSOCIATION CLUB’, open to ‘international and well-known players’, which would play on Wednesdays. Should anyone doubt the club’s credentials, there was …

Second, responses to the Corinthians, especially before 1914, were determined partly by the predisposition of key sections of the urban bourgeoisie in Northern and Central Europe to look favourably on all things English. It helped, of course, that soccer was ‘a game of the elite’in the countries that the Corinthians visited. 2 Sports tourism could be an especially congenial experience when the hosts were attentive, flattering and shared a common social background with their guests. Third, the host-visitor relationship was characterized at first by deference in that the tourists were expected to demonstrate excellence, which continental sides could not hope to match.

They represented ‘the cream of amateur talent’and were especially praised for their ‘ever-increasing missionary work’, taking the game ‘into places where first-class contests were otherwise impossible’. 1 Such comments testified to the efforts of Jackson, assisted by a generally sympathetic sporting press, to create and market the Corinthian brand in the late nineteenth century. Moreover, when he withdrew from active involvement in the club’s affairs in 1898, the founder could be confident that his legacy was in safe hands. The secretary’s role passed first to GO Smith and WJ Oakley until 1902, then to BO Corbett until 1904 and then to SH Day until 1906. Thereafter, it was taken on by WU Timmis, who saw the club through English soccer’s ‘Great Split’and the disruption caused by the war. Each of these sporting gentlemen had played for …

In this article, we consider association football tours between both countries from 1914 to 1955 against the backdrop of increased racism and segregation in South Africa and the anti-colonial movement in India. We draw from a range of sources, including archives, unpublished reports and newspaper articles. The sports tours helped to solidify relations between Indians in South Africa and India underpinning political, cultural, spiritual and emotional ties; they show how Indianness was forged among diasporans and that this was highly contested and constantly transformed in relation to external conditions; and they expose the racism on the part of white sporting organisations in particular and white politicians in general in South Africa.

Tours in the popular sport of cricket, football and rugby were very popular. These tours tested local opposition against foreign competition, brought in revenue to local and national sports associations and contributed to the development of a white South African identity. Austrian football teams were extensive travellers and popular attractions around the world. Prior to the Second World War Austrian football was highly regarded and was able to compete and hold its own against English and Scottish clubs and representative teams.

Chris Bolsmann |University rankings and the consolidation of elite networked institutions in an era of global capital|Sarah Amsler, Chris Bolsmann|2015/9/12||||||In this paper we explore the dual role of global university rankings in the creation of a new, knowledge-identified, transnational capitalist class and in facilitating new forms of social exclusion. We examine how and why the practice of ranking universities has become widely defined by national and international organisations as an important instrument of political and economic policy. We consider the development of university rankings into a global business combining social research, marketing and public relations, as a tangible policy tool that narrowly redefines the social purposes of higher education itself. Finally, it looks at how the influence of rankings on national funding for teaching and research constrains wider public debate about the meaning of ‘good’ and meaningful education in the United Kingdom and other national contexts, particularly by shifting the debate away from democratic publics upward into the elite networked institutions of global capital. We conclude by arguing that, rather than regarding world university rankings as a means to establish criteria of educational value, the practice may be understood as an exclusionary one that furthers the alignment of higher education with neoliberal rationalities at both national and global levels. exclusion; higher education; knowledge society; neoliberalism; transnational capitalist class; university rankings

Upon closer scrutiny, the logic of the editors in incorporating such a varied input becomes clear, where they maintain (p. 5) that'we believe that the collection reflects the spirit of Seattle'. What unfolds in the 14 chapters is a very useful compilation that attempts to locate the role of labour within an era of globalization and, at the same time, branches out to other social actors within diverse contexts.

Chris Bolsmann |Labour internationalisms and globalisation|Chris Bolsmann|2003/7/1||34|2|350-369|Taylor & Francis Group|This review article considers three books and three articles that acknowledge the detrimental effect of globalisation on labour. These works.accept that a revival of labour internationalism is occurring, and they attempt to map ways forward for the labour movement and trade unionism. Broad overlapping streams can be identified that attempt to locate the possibilities for labour in an era of globalisation. These include theorists who argue for global social movement unionism and its derivatives, those who position their analysis within international political economy, some who call for the restructuring of global governance, those who argue for new networks, and finally, those who call for the re-politicisation of the labour movement. Rather than arguing for one best way, the conclusions drawn from this review maintain that a multi-faceted approach, which continues to revive labour and strengthen its position and … 
Chris Bolsmann |SOCIOLOGY OF WORK UNIT (SWOP)|Lucien van der Walt, Chris Bolsmann, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2002/8||||||The “transformation” of public sector universities in post-apartheid South Africa remains at the centre of government’s political commitments, policy formation processes, and public debate. 1 Yet one aspect of university restructuring has received surprisingly little attention: the trend towards the outsourcing of support services functions in the 1990s. Although the conflicts arising from this process caught the public eye on a number of occasions, most notably the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the support services at the University of the Witwatersrand in 2000, there has been no thorough study of the rise and effects of support services outsourcing in South Africa. The few studies that exist tend to be brief, sometimes journalistic, and generally confined to an examination of a single institution. By comparison, issues such as curriculum restructuring, university governance,“marketisation” and the proposed …

Chris Bolsmann |La solidaridad y el internacionalismo sindical en la lucha contra el Apartheid|Chris Bolsmann, Yunersy Legorburo Ibarra||||||El Colegio de México, Centro de Estudios de Asia y África|En este artículo se examinan la solidaridad y el internacionalismo sindical. Con mayor precisión, se trata de una investigación acerca de las relaciones que surgieron durante los años setenta entre trabajadores sudafricanos y alemanes y dirigentes sindicales de una compañía; a saber, Volkswagen. Por medio del análisis de las relaciones identificadas durante el apartheid, se estudia cómo se traslapan y convergen los intereses económicos, políticos e institucionales; al mismo tiempo, se reconocen los intereses de los protagonistas. Este artículo examina cómo esos intereses, a su vez, fueron capaces de influir en la solidaridad y el inter-nacionalismo sindical. Se consideran dos fases en la solidaridad y el internacionalismo. La primera analiza el surgimiento de vínculos laborales directos entre trabajadores sudafricanos y alemanes, por un lado, y dirigentes sindicales, por el otro, en la última parte de la década …

Ovande Furtado Jr. |Influence of exercise intensity on the decision-making performance of experienced and inexperienced soccer players|Fabio E Fontana, Oldemar Mazzardo, Comfort Mokgothu, Ovande Furtado Jr, Jere D Gallagher|2009/4|Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology|31|2|135-151||The aim of this study was to examine the decision-making performance of experienced and inexperienced soccer players at four exercise intensities (rest, 40%, 60%, and 80% maximal aerobic power). The decision-making performance of inexperienced players was expected to demonstrate an inverted-U shape with increasing levels of exercise. For the experienced players, decision making was predicted to show no change in performance with increased exercise intensity. Thirty-two adult soccer players (16 experienced, 16 inexperienced) were asked to answer seven decision-making questions as quickly and accurately as possible for each exercise intensity. Results indicated that exercise does not affect the accuracy of decision making; however, the speed of decision making for experienced and inexperienced players improved with increased exercise intensity. These results suggest that physiologically … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Anti-fat bias among physical education teachers and majors|Fabio Eduardo Fontana, Ovande Furtado, Ripley Marston, Oldemar Mazzardo, Jere Gallagher|2013|Physical Educator|70|1|15|Sagamore Publishing LLC|Obesity has reached epidemic levels, and physical education teachers are on the front lines to combat it. However, anti-fat bias from physical education teachers may be a barrier against the participation of students who are obese in physical activity. Thus, our purpose was to investigate the attitude of physical education teachers and majors toward obese individuals. Fortyseven physical education teachers and 149 majors participated in the study. Participants answered three questionnaires: Anti-Fat Attitude Scale (AFAS measures explicit attitudes toward obese individuals), Perception of Obese Students by Physical Education Teachers questionnaire (POSPET measures how teachers perceive students who are obese during class), and Implicit Association Test (IAT is a timed assessment measuring automatic attitudes toward obese individuals through word categorizations: good-bad, lazymotivated).

Ovande Furtado Jr. |Whole and part practice: A meta-analysis|Fabio E Fontana, Oldemar Mazzardo, Ovande Furtado Jr, Jere D Gallagher|2009/10|Perceptual and motor skills|109|2|517-530|Ammons Scientific, Ltd.|Motor learning textbooks provide specific recommendations for the use of whole and part practice during motor skill acquisition. Magill recommended basing decisions on Naylor and Briggs' hypothesis of task complexity and organization, while Schmidt and Wrisberg recommended basing decisions on skill classification. To evaluate the accuracy of these recommendations, a meta-analysis was conducted. Through a literature search, 44 articles were located, and 20 provided sufficient information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were calculated using means for whole and part practice for acquisition and retention. Although several analyses were compromised by insufficient studies investigating whole and part practice, mean effect sizes generally supported motor learning textbooks. To better verify the empirical validity of recommendations for the use of whole and part practice, more studies are necessary.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of professors in physical education departments toward obese individuals. Professors from randomly selected institutions across all four US regions participated in the study (N = 94). Participants took the Implicit Association Test and answered the Anti-Fat Attitude Scale and two questions specifically designed to measure their attitudes toward physical education teachers and majors who are obese. The participants exhibited implicit good–bad (p < .001) and lazy–motivated (p < .001) anti-fat biases. Professors favored accepting majors who are obese (p < .001), but they strongly disapproved of obese physical education teachers as role models to their students (p < .001). Explicit anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of …

To master FMS, performance evaluation is necessary. In this study, we investigated the reliability of a new observational assessment tool. In Phase I, 110 video clips of children performing five locomotor, and six manipulative FMSs were developed. In Phase II, rating scales were developed, and their efficacy was evaluated by comparing judgments of 30 undergraduate students to a standard. The mean weighted kappa (.71) was considered good (range .51–.85). Of the 11 rating scales, 6 were modified, and 5 remained unchanged. This study sets the foundation for the development of a new observational scale to assess fundamental movement skills.

This study’s goals were to determine whether (a) RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants and (b) academic timing , in which academic status determines age groupings more than strict age guidelines for college sports, influenced the formation of RAE. Participants were 150 junior college baseball players. Our results showed that RAE was only a significant factor, comparing the birth distribution of participants born before and after the midpoint of the participation year, when academic timing was also a factor in determining age groupings. In addition, the birth rate distribution, though not significantly different than expected, was greater … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Relationship between fundamental movement skills and body mass index in rural elementary age children|Mariah L Bolin|2013||||||A factor of how much physical activity a child gets could be determined by the level of mastery of fundamental movement skills that are needed for the establishment of skills used in many forms of adult physical activity. Children who master a number of fundamental movement skills are more likely to be physically active and they also may be more likely to take part in physical activity when being compared to peers with a lesser level of motor skill proficiency. Children who are considered overweight tend to engage less often in physical activities, which in turn may prevents them from acquiring fundamental movements skills. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and fundamental movement skills in children ages 5 to 7 in a rural school system. The following two research questions were formulated: Does the performance of locomotor and manipulative … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Furtado-Gallagher Movement Skill Assessment: Collecting evidence for content-related validity|Ovande Furtado|2004/12/15||||||The National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) emphasizes in its second edition of the National Standards for Physical Education the importance of linking instruction and assessment in physical education. NASPE standards reflect what students should know and be able to do as a result of a quality physical education (NASPE, 2004). This link is even more beneficial to students and teachers alike when assessment is aligned with the NASPE content standards. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a criterion-referenced assessment tool to test movement concepts and fundamental movement skills of children ages 3 through 10 and provide evidence for content-related validity. An attempt was made to develop an assessment tool that is tied closely to the postulates of the National Standards for Physical Education (NASPE, 2004). The gathering of evidence for content-related validity was accomplished through judgments of a panel of 20 content experts (professors = 8; and PE teachers = 12). An Internet-based item review form was used to collect information from experts. Experts rated content at item level (31 items divided in 7 categories) using a four point likert-type scale where 1 being 'not important at all' and 4 'very important'. Content was also rated at test level (7 questions) addressing the match between the test content and the test general characteristics (e.g., match between the proposed set of items and the test purpose). This set of questions were rated on a five point likert-type scale with 1 being 'poor' and 5 being 'excellent'. Many of the expert reviewers also provided written feedback on the content of the … 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |The relationship of movement skills with habitual and organized physical activity in seven and eight-year-old children|Oldemar Mazzardo, Fábio Eduardo Fontana, Ovande Furtado, Jere D Gallagher|2018/3/29|Pensar a Prática|21|1|||PURPOSE: To verify the association of motor skills with habitual and organized PA participation, and sedentary behavior for males and females. METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls. 
Ovande Furtado Jr. |Investigating expert-rater agreement and inter/intra-rater reliability of two fundamental movement skills for the locomotor subscale of the FG-COMPASS|Lino Perez|2018||||||The Furtado-Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS) is an observational rating scale using sequential decisions to assess fundamental movement skills. The current version of the test has 3 locomotor and 5 manipulative skills. This study aimed to assess expert-rater agreement and inter/intra rater reliability of two new scales to be added to the locomotor subtest. This study was divided into two phases. In Phase I, 60 children between the ages of 5 and 10 were filmed performing the skills of galloping and vertical jumping. An expert in motor behavior classified the videotapes using the newly created rating scales. Next, 8 video clips were selected for training purposes and 24 video clips for testing purposes. In Phase II, 30 undergraduate and graduate students served as raters and underwent a training session prior the testing session. Participants were instructed not to classify the video clips based on the apparent age of the children as skill levels were distributed across all age levels. Further, to avoid guessing, participants were not told how many videos of each level they would be rating. Unlike the training sessions, participants did not receive feedback during testing sessions. Weighted kappa (Kw) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were used to analyze data. Results suggested a “very good” agreement between expert and rater consensus for vertical jumping (Kw = .96) and galloping (Kw=.89) and an “excellent” agreement for vertical jump (ICC = .98) and galloping (ICC = .95). Inter-rater reliability resulted in “very good” agreement for vertical jumping (Kw=.92) and a “good …

Thus, the accurate and reliable measurement of FMS is of related importance. This article presents the results of two studies intended to assess expert-rater agreement and inter-/intrarater scoring reliability in the administration of a new observational FMS instrument, the Furtado–Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS).

Ovande Furtado Jr. |The Relative Age Effect and Academic Timing in College Baseball|Thomas Beals, Jr. Furtado, Ovande.|2012||||A32|Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|Background/Purpose Previous research has suggested that older athletes within the same age grouping are often perceived to be more talented simply due to advanced maturity. This perception leads to biased selection and skewed participation rates favoring the oldest participants within the group. This resulting skewed distribution is termed Relative Age Effect (RAE). Further, academic institutions often group their participants according to their academic status, not strictly by age. This factor, termed Academic Timing, can result in the ages of competitors spanning more than a single calendar year. Therefore, our purpose was to investigate whether RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants, and study whether Academic Timing influences the formation of RAE.

Andrew Linden |Disrupting dominant discourses:# HERESPROOF of interest in women's sports|Dunja Antunovic, Andrew D Linden|2015/1/2|Feminist Media Studies|15|1|157-159|Routledge|Feminist sport scholars have observed the underrepresentation and misrepresentation of women athletes and women’s sports in media with great concern (Cheryl Cooky, Michael A. Messner, and Robin Hextrum 2013). Scholars have attributed this drought to decision making: national surveys indicate that industry leaders in sports media operate under the assumption that their readers, viewers, and listeners are not interested in women’s sports (Marie Hardin 2005; Marie Hardin, Dunja Antunovic, Steve Bien-Aimé, and Roubing Li 2013). To challenge this assumption, in November 2013, the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota launched a social media initiative titled the# HERESPROOF Project. The Tucker Center encourages Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook users to post photos from girls’ and women’s sporting events and to attach the “HERESPROOF Seal” to … 
Andrew Linden |From Ladies' Days to Women's Initiatives: American Pastimes and Distaff Consumption|Jaime Schultz, Andrew D Linden|2014/1/22|The International Journal of the History of Sport|31|1-2|156-180|Routledge|American entrepreneurs have, for more than a century, sought to cultivate female consumers of national pastimes, specifically horse racing, boxing, baseball, football and basketball. Because these sports have been principally and historically associated with manliness and masculinity, it is more appropriate to think in terms of women's involvement and consumption, as opposed to their athletic participation when it comes to ‘pastime' status. Marketing campaigns aimed at women by the promoters of national pastimes reveal complex processes of commercialisation, bourgeoisification and hypercommodification. The ways in which major sports leagues and administrators appealed to women have long been based on essentialised feminine roles, treating women as moralising agents, wives and mothers, and consumers. These strategies represent the primary force in shaping women's inclusion in national pastimes. In … 
Andrew Linden |Revolution on the American Gridiron: Gender, contested space, and women’s football in the 1970s|Andrew D Linden|2015/12/12|The International Journal of the History of Sport|32|18|2171-2189|Routledge|Scholarship on the 1970s ‘women’s movement’ in the USA has grown in recent years. However, this area has yet to fully incorporate women’s athletic experiences. This paper brings together these two areas of scholarship through analysis of women’s experiences playing professional football in 1970s America. Women athletes articulated little connection between football and the larger feminist campaign for corporeal autonomy and equality and some pronounced a distinctly antifeminist identity. My intent is not to force the feminist mantle on these women or to contest their self-descriptions. Rather, I seek to locate their experiences within the larger women’s movement using historian Anne Enke’s idea of ‘contested space’ (Finding the Movement, 2007). Drawing on interviews with 13 women on three different teams during the 1970s, I argue that while women football players did not explicitly align with the feminist … 
Andrew Linden |Tempering the Dichotomous Flame: Social History, Cultural History, and Postmodernism(s) in the Journal of Sport History, 1974–2014|Andrew D Linden|2016/4/1|Journal of Sport History|43|1|66-82|University of Illinois Press|In the June 2014 issue of the Journal of American History, which includes a forum titled “State of the Field: Sports in American History,” Amy Bass argues that, as many humanities-based disciplines adopted tenets of cultural history, sport history did not. Based on over a decade of debate about social, cultural, and postmodernist paradigms, Bass's assertion illuminates continuing historiographical arguments about epistemology and theory in sport history. In this article, I respond to these discussions by analyzing 405 full-length articles in the Journal of Sport History from the first issue in 1974 through the end of 2014. Drawing on philosopher R. Scott Kretchmar's caution against “dualisms [and] dichotomies” in sport scholarship, I argue for a holistic understanding of sport history, rather than the dichotomous historiography present over the past decade. 
Andrew Linden |Heat-Related Deaths in American Football: An Interdisciplinary Approach|Jaime Schultz, W Larry Kenney, Andrew D Linden|2014/11|Sport History Review|45|2|123-144||As observers of American football turn their attention to the crises of concussions, subconcussive hits, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and attendant issues related to direct contact and collision, it may be easy to lose track of the too frequent occurrence of what experts refer to as a type of “indirect” fatality caused by “systemic failure as a result of exertion”: those associated with heat. 1 Typically brought about by engaging in intense physical effort in hot and humid conditions, the vast majority of these deaths need not occur. Despite the growing scientific understanding of the problem, however, heat-related deaths persist, often surging at different points in history. It is not just an issue of science, then, but also an issue of culture and one that necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. Physicians have documented heat-related deaths in football since the early twentieth century, but it was the 2001 death of the … 
Andrew Linden |Looking at Losing: Presentations of the Media's Narrative of the Cleveland Browns’ Relocation|Andrew D Linden|2012/12/1|The International Journal of the History of Sport|29|18|2575-2598|Taylor & Francis Group|On November 6, 1995, Art Modell announced his intention to relocate the National Football League's (NFL) Cleveland Browns to Baltimore following the season. After 4 months of civic activism from Cleveland's community and legal action from the city's politicians, Cleveland, the NFL and Modell agreed to a deal that allowed the long-time owner to honour his contract with Baltimore and simultaneously provided a NFL club to Cleveland to begin play in 1999. This settlement was unique because it allowed Cleveland to retain the naming rights, colours, logo and, most significantly, the history of the Browns. Media presentations of Modell's announcement during the 4-month period illuminated a complex symbiotic relationship between the press, the public and sports entrepreneurs. The local media castigated and vilified Modell for betraying Cleveland's community and disturbing the city's supposed ‘renaissance’, while … 
Andrew Linden |Writing sport online: An analysis of the pitfalls and potential of academic blogging|Andrew D Linden, Lindsay Parks Pieper|2017/7/1|Journal of Sport History|44|2|257-274|University of Illinois Press|Opportunities abound for scholars' digital engagement. Among the numerous available technologies, blogging has emerged as a medium that presents both opportunities and challenges for academics. Although scholars have reflected on the values and drawbacks of blogging in academia, few have specifically analyzed academic sport blogs. This paper uses a content analysis of six sport-specific online forums to examine the composition of contributors and the content of posts, as well as the pitfalls and potential of academic sport blogging. Our analysis suggests that, while blogging offers novel opportunities for scholars, the forum simultaneously reifies problems already present in sport scholarship and academia. 
Andrew Linden |Blue-Collar Identity and the" Culture of Losing": Cleveland and the" Save Our Browns" Campaign|Andrew D Linden|2015/10/18|Journal of Sport History|42|3|340-0360|University of Illinois Press|In November 1995, Cleveland football fans began the "Save Our Browns" campaign after owner Art Modell announced he would move the team to Baltimore after the season. By February 1996, the initiative influenced the National Football League's decision to allow Cleveland to keep the legacy of the Browns and offer the city a new team. Letters found at the Pro Football Hall of Fame show how the Save Our Browns campaign illuminated a "culture of losing"–the combination of a declining city, poor sports teams, and angst from social change–in the greater Cleveland community. I argue that Clevelanders' fight for the Browns represented their desire for a Cleveland of the past that included an idealized blue-collar identity consisting of expressions of heteronormative, white masculinity. These expressions show how some considered sports more important than other forms of social change in the Rust Belt city in the … 
Andrew Linden |Political Football: Social Movements and the Professional Gridiron in the United States, 1955-1979|Andrew David Linden|2016/8/26||||||Politics and political movements appeared in professional football since the sport emerged. However, because the National Football League (NFL) was not yet popular across the country, these issues had little effect on the broader culture. In the second half of the century, the NFL became the most popular consumer sport in the country. Conflicts between labor and capital, between men and women, between races and ethnicities, and between groups associated with the broader counterculture and liberation movements were brought by political advocates into the sport. Nonetheless, throughout this same time, the league had political priorities of its own and endorsed certain political issues while not engaging others. In this dissertation, I utilize a “multiple histories” approach to analyze the effect of social movements on the NFL and demonstrate the influence of political football in American culture. To do so, I examine how four social movements (Civil Rights, the New Left and counterculture, labor, and the women’s movement) intersected with professional football from the late 1950s through the 1970s. League representatives had varying reactions each time a social movement appeared on the gridiron. For example, some team owners and coaches supported black athletes fighting to desegregate the game and other areas of society through non-violent protest, but they reacted to the broader Civil Rights Movement by reaffirming notions of white supremacy. While league marketers promoted athletes who endorsed the Vietnam War and other “patriotic” efforts to defeat communism, they avoided engaging with critics (particularly if they were players …

Andrew Linden |LT: The Life & Times dir. by Peter Radovich|Andrew D Linden|2015||42|2|230-231|University of Illinois Press|In an era when controversy continuously casts a negative shadow over the National Football League, memories of past American football greats historicize a league that has grappled with athletes’ personal troubles and larger social issues. In LT: The Life & Times, Showtime Sports presents a narrative of one of the sport’s legends, who, like many players today, faced troubles off the gridiron. As former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor—colloquially known as “LT”—states at the beginning of the nearly two-hour documentary,“As easy as football is to me... is as hard as life is to me.” Indeed, LT was a dynamic gridiron star.

At age thirty-four he suffered a dislocated collarbone while wrestling. After the gymnasium trainers tried and failed, Galen properly diagnosed himself, treated himself for forty days and fully recovered. He also writes about a youthful wrestler injured by a blow to the sternum. When others could not help him, an abscess formed and the youth might have died, but Galen excised the diseased sternum and the youth survived. News of Galen’s expertise reached Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who appointed Galen personal physician to his heir Commodus. Galen also received an imperial salary for preparing Aurelius’ daily potion of theriac (a mixture of over sixty ingredients from viper flesh to opium), which supposedly helped the emperor sleep. Despite losing many of his writings in a fire in 192, Galen continued to write and treat patients well into his old age. Readers … 
Andrew Linden |A Brief Taxonomy of Sports that Were Not Quite American National Pastimes: Fads and Flashes-in-the-Pan, Nationwide and Regional Pastimes, the Pastimes of Other Nations, and Pan …|Jaime Schultz, Dunja Antunovic, Adam Berg, Justine Kaempfer, Andrew D Linden, Thomas Rorke, Colleen English, Mark Dyreson|2014/1/22|The International Journal of the History of Sport|31|1-2|250-272|Routledge|Several sports have served as American national pastimes over the course of the nation's history. Horse racing, hunting, prize fighting, baseball, football, and basketball have waxed and waned in a long series of debates over what constitutes ‘true' national pastimes. Unlike some nations that have declared national pastimes by governmental fiat, US national games emerge from organic and sometimes chaotic cultural processes. An alternative history of sports that have become popular and widespread national habits but have not quite become national pastimes sheds important light on what national pastimes are and how they have developed in American history. A variety of pretenders to the title of national pastime have come and gone. These challengers can be categorised as fads and flashes-in-the-pan, nationwide and regional pastimes, the pastimes of other nations, and pan-national pastimes. An … 
Andrew Linden |Sportista: female fandom in the United States|Andrew D Linden|2013/10/8||16|9|1213-1216|Routledge|Andrei S. Markovits and Emily K. Albertson’s Sportista: Female Fandom in the United States analyzes the often stereotyped female fan of big-time sports in the USA. Markovits has produced a considerable amount of scholarship on comparative sport culture in both the USA and Europe. Albertson, an undergraduate at the University of Michigan at the time of writing, clearly identifies herself as one of the female fans studied in Sportista. Together the two authors examine ‘the woman who not only loves her sports but also knows them’and who ‘distinguishes herself from most of her world by being immensely passionate and knowledgeable about sports’(p. 5). Coining the term ‘sportista’–from the feminine term ‘fashionista’–Markovits and Albertson argue that women have crafted a distinctive identity as fans of ‘the hegemonic sports cultures’ in the USA (p. 5). While sportistas know a plethora of sporting information, the … 
Andrew Linden |Money Games: Profiting from the Convergence of Sports and Entertainment by David M Carter|Andrew D Linden|2013||40|2|334-335|University of Illinois Press|The business of sports and entertainment rapidly expanded in the last half of the twentieth century. According to David M. Carter, the convergence of sports and entertainment “has been relatively contained” and primarily occurred “in and around sports venues”(p. 1). Today, this convergence is “borderless” and “pervasive,” and it “continues to create business challenges while simultaneously providing significant opportunities for those hoping to make money from it”(p. 1). In essence, Carter claims that sports have become synonymous with entertainment. For example, his analysis of the burgeoning “poker boom”(p. 150) astutely reifies the notion that there is a hazy demarcation point between sports and entertainment. Carter thus focuses on stakeholders, who have monetized the convergence, and offers recommendations for future entrepreneurs about ways in which to profit from the burgeoning industry. Carter … 
Andrew Linden |The Cultural Nexus of Sport and Business: The Relocation of the Cleveland Browns|Andrew D Linden|2012||||||On November 6, 1995, Arthur Modell announced his intention to transfer the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore after the conclusion of the season. Throughout the ensuing four months, the cities of Cleveland and Baltimore, along with Modell, National Football League (NFL) officials and politicians, battled over the future of the franchise. After legal and social conflicts, the NFL and Cleveland civic officials agreed on a deal that allowed Modell to honor his contract with Baltimore and simultaneously provided an NFL team to Cleveland to begin play in 1999. This settlement was unique because it allowed Cleveland to retain the naming rights, colors, logo, and, most significantly, the history of the Browns.

It is unknown how elderly individuals behave during prolonged standing and how demanding such a task is for them. We recorded the center of pressure (COP) position of 14 elderly subjects and 14 adults while they performed prolonged standing (30 min) and quiet stance tasks (60 s) on a force plate. The number and amplitude of the COP patterns, the root mean square (RMS), speed, and frequency of the COP sway were analyzed. The elderly subjects were able to stand for prolonged periods but they produced postural changes of lesser amplitude and a decreased sway during the prolonged standing task. Both the adults and the elderly subjects were influenced by the prolonged standing task, as demonstrated by their increased COP RMS and COP speed in the quiet …

Paulo Marchetti |Propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a biomechanical study|Andre Serra Bley, Joao Carlos Ferrari Correa, Amir Curcio Dos Reis, Nayra Deise Dos Anjos Rabelo, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucareli|2014/5/15|PloS one|9|5|e97606|Public Library of Science|Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF …

Paulo Marchetti |Effects of the pullover exercise on the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles as evaluated by EMG|Paulo H Marchetti, Marco C Uchida|2011/11|Journal of applied biomechanics|27|4|380-384||The aim of the current study was to investigate the EMG activity of pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles during the pullover exercise. Eight healthy male volunteers took part in the study. The EMG activity of the pectoralis major and that of the latissimus dorsi of the right side were acquired simultaneously during the pullover exercise with a free-weight barbell during both the concentric and eccentric phases of the movement. After a warm-up, all the subjects were asked to perform the pullover exercise against an external load of 30% of their body weight, during 1 set × 10 repetitions. The criterion adopted to normalize the EMG data was the maximal voluntary isometric activation. The present findings demonstrated that the barbell pullover exercise emphasized the muscle action of the pectoralis major more than that of the latissimus dorsi, and the higher activation depended on the external force lever arm …

We compared muscle fatigue and recovery time between 2 representative muscles: the middle deltoid and the quadriceps femoris. METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with COPD (FEV1 46.1 ± 10.3% of predicted) underwent maximal voluntary isometric contraction and an endurance test (60% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction, to the limit of tolerance). The maximal voluntary isometric contraction test was repeated after 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, and 24 hours for both the quadriceps femoris and middle deltoid. Surface electromyography was recorded throughout the endurance test. RESULTS: Maximal voluntary isometric contraction significantly decreased only for the middle deltoid between …

Ten physical active participants were evaluated during this study. All subjects were familiarized with the isometric squat position in all conditions: without and with knee wrap (hard and soft stiffness). The squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric squat contractions in 3 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with soft knee wrap (SKW) and with hard knee wrap (HKW). The peak of force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions WKW and HKW (P= 0.029, ES= 1.27, Δ%= 22%]) and WKW and SKW (P= 0.038, ES= 1.20, Δ%= 21%]). The use of the knee wrap under the presented conditions seem to increase the maximal isometric force during the squat exercise, independent of the level of stiffness of the knee wrap.

Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular. 
Paulo Marchetti |Muscle Activation Differs between Three Different Knee Joint-Angle Positions during a Maximal Isometric Back Squat Exercise|P.H. MARCHETTI, J.J. DA SILVA, B.J. SCHOENFELD, P.S.M NARDI, A.C. ALONSO, J.M.D GREVE, E.H. HARTIGAN|2016|Journal of Sports Medicine|2016||1-7||The purpose of this study was to compare muscle activation of the lower limb muscles when performing a maximal isometric back squat exercise over three different positions. Fifteen young, healthy, resistance-trained men performed an isometric back squat at three knee joint angles (20°, 90°, and 140°) in a randomized, counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography was used to measure muscle activation of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), and gluteus maximus (GM). In general, muscle activity was the highest at 90° for the three quadriceps muscles, yet differences in muscle activation between knee angles were muscle specific. Activity of the GM was significantly greater at 20° and 90° compared to 140°. The BF and ST displayed similar activation at all joint angles. In conclusion, knee position alters muscles activation of the quadriceps and gluteus maximus muscles. An isometric back squat at 90° generates the highest overall muscle activation, yet an isometric back squat at 140° generates the lowest overall muscle activation of the VL and GM only.

CORRÊA, G. MARTINS, G.B. VILELA JUNIOR, W.A. GOMES|2015|International Journal of Sports Science|5|1|16-18|SAP|The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects on maximal isometric force with two different techniques of knee wraps placement (spiral and X) during back squat exercise. Twenty-one physical active participants were evaluated during this study. The back squat exercise position was set up individually, guaranteeing their thigh parallel to the floor, the arms crossed on the chest, and the feet were kept always in the same position for all trials and conditions. All subjects performed three maximal isometric back squat contractions in 4 different conditions: without knee wrap (WKW), with spiral knee wrap technique (SKW), with X knee wrap technique (XKW) and tensor (T). The peak force was acquired at a 100Hz sampling frequency, during 3 seconds, 5 minutes of resting and all conditions were randomized. The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was evaluated after each trial and condition. The results shows significant differences for peak force between conditions SKW vs WKW (P= 0.044, ES= 0.55, Δ%= 10.8%), and XKW vs WKW (P= 0.009, ES= 0.62, Δ%= 13.6%). The use of different knee wrap techniques (spiral and X techniques) presented an effective carry-over effect, but without differences between techniques, and the RPE was similar in all conditions.

Paulo Marchetti |The Effects of Uni-and Bilateral Fatigue on Postural and Power Tasks|Paulo H Marchetti, Maria IV Orselli, Marcos Duarte|2013|Journal of Applied Biomechanics 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc|29|1|44-48|Human Kinetics, Inc|The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of unilateral and bilateral fatigue on both postural and power bipedal tasks. Ten healthy subjects performed two tasks: bipedal quiet standing and a maximal bipedal counter-movement jumping before and after unilateral (with either the dominant or nondominant lower limb) and bilateral (with both lower limbs) fatigue. We employed two force plates (one under each lower limb) to measure the ground reaction forces and center of pressure produced by subjects during the tasks. To quantify the postural sway during quiet standing, we calculated the resultant center of pressure (COP) speed and COP area of sway, as well as the mean weight distribution between lower limbs. To quantify the performance during the countermovement jumping, we calculated the jump height and the peak force of each lower limb. We observed that both unilateral and bilateral fatigue … 
Paulo Marchetti |Selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle during low-intensity and fatiguing tasks|Paulo H Marchetti, André F Kohn, Marcos Duarte|2011/6|Journal of sports science & medicine|10|2|322|Dept. of Sports Medicine, Medical Faculty of Uludag University|In order to understand the potential selective activation of the rectus abdominis muscle, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: the curl up (supine trunk raise) and the leg raise (supine bent leg raise) at low intensity (in which only a few motor units are recruited). In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a certain force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activities of the lower and upper portions of the rectus abdominis muscle during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG intensities of the upper and lower portions during the curl up exercise was significantly larger than during the leg raise exercise (p= 0.02). A cross-correlation analysis … 
Paulo Marchetti |Effect of Resistance Training Frequency on Neuromuscular Performance and Muscle Morphology after Eight Weeks in Trained Men.|Felipe Alves Brigatto, Tiago Volpi Braz, TCDC Zanini, Moisés Diego Germano, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Brad Jon Schoenfeld, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Charles Ricardo Lopes|2019|Journal of strength and conditioning research|||||The purpose of this study was to investigate the chronic effects of training muscle groups 1 day per week vs. 2 days per week on neuromuscular performance and morphological adaptations in trained men with the number of sets per muscle group equated between conditions. Participants were randomly assigned in 2 experimental groups: 1 session· wk per muscle group (G1, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained once a week with 16 sets or 2 sessions· wk per muscle group (G2, n= 10), where every muscle group was trained twice a week with 8 sets per session. All other variables were held constant over the 8-week study period. No significant difference between conditions for maximal strength in the back squat or bench press, muscle thickness in the elbow extensors, elbow flexors, or quadriceps femoris, and muscle endurance in the back squat and bench press performed at 60% 1RM was detected. Effect size favored G2 for some outcome measurements, suggesting the potential of a slight benefit to the higher training frequency. In conclusion, both G1 and G2 significantly enhance neuromuscular adaptations, with a similar change noted between experimental conditions.

Paulo Marchetti |Alongamento passivo agudo não afeta a atividade muscular máxima dos ísquiotibiais|AS Bley, PS Nardi, PH Marchetti|2012/12|Motricidade|8|4|80-86|Revista Motricidade/Edições Desafio Singular|The acute stretching may influence the force production in different tasks and sports performances. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of acute passive stretch on the electrical activity of the biceps femoris (BF) and hamstring muscle (HS) strength. Fourteen young adults, sedentary took part of this study. The subjects were asked to produce the maximal isometric contractions before and after a passive stretching protocol. The stretching protocol consisted of three attempts at 60 seconds and resting 15 seconds between each attempt. The subjects were analyzed using the following techniques: maximal isometric force (MIF), integrated electromyography (IEMG) and median frequency (Fmed) of the EMG signal of the BF before and after stretching. We performed the MIF, IEMG and Fmed of the EMG signal under these conditions and compared using a paired Student t test. The MIF of the biceps femoris (14.1 ± 4.9 e 13.1 ± 4.5 Kgf, respectively, p = .12), IEMG (208.4 ± 89.9 e 189.3 ± 75 V.s, respectively, p = .059), and FMed (22.7 ± 4 e 23.4 ± 5.5 Hz, respectively, p = .52) showed no significant differences between conditions before and after stretching. The acute effects of passive stretching did not significantly influence the pattern of electrical activation of the BF and the maximal isometric force produced by the HS. 
Paulo Marchetti |Influence of unilateral fatigue of lower limbs on the bilateral vertical jump|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|2011/12|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|17|6|405-408|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|It is common to observe bilateral strength deficit during the vertical jump. This is characterized by lower strength produced during bilateral contractions, when compared to the sum of the unilateral contractions of similar muscles. There is not much scientific knowledge about the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unilateral fatigue on bilateral deficit performance during bipedal vertical jump. Ten sedentary young adults unilaterally fatigued each lower limb and performed vertical jumps (bipedal and unipedal). We measured the vertical ground reaction force and myoelectrical activity to each lower limb and conditions (pre-fatigue, fatigue of the dominant limb (FD) and non dominant limb (FND)) were measured. Differences between tasks and conditions only on the pre-fatigue (p=0.030) were observed. Differences were observed for the bipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p=0.005), and unipedal vertical jump between pre-fatigue and FD (p<0.001) and FND (p<0.001). We only observed change on the performance of bipedal vertical jump during the FD condition. We observed a trend to the asymmetry index decrease for the muscular action of the fatigued contralateral lower limb by electromyography. The results suggest that there is a common command where the nervous system considers the muscles simultaneously activated as a unit, except in conditions of unilateral lower limb fatigue. 
Paulo Marchetti |Influência da fadiga unilateral de membro inferior sobre o salto vertical bilateral|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Marco Carlos Uchida|2011|Rev. bras. med. esporte|17|6|405-408||Em saltos verticais é comum a verificação do déficit de força bilateral. Essa é caracterizada pela menor força gerada em contrações bilaterais, quando comparada à soma das contrações unilaterais dos mesmos músculos. Pouco se conhece sobre o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre atividades bilaterais. O objetivo do estudo foi verificar o efeito da fadiga unilateral sobre o rendimento e o déficit bilateral durante saltos verticais bipedais. Dez adultos jovens sedentários fatigaram unilateralmente cada membro inferior e realizaram saltos verticais (bipedal e unipedal). Foram medidas a força de reação do solo vertical e a atividade mioelétrica de cada membro em cada condição (pré-fadiga, fadiga do membro dominante (FD) e não dominante (FND)). Houve diferença entre tarefas e condições apenas na pré-fadiga (p= 0,030). Verificaram-se diferenças para o salto bipedal entre a condição de pré-fadiga e FD (p= 0,005), e no salto unipedal, entre a pré-fadiga e FD (p< 0,001) e FND (p< 0,001). Apenas durante a condição de FD houve alteração no desempenho dos saltos bipedais, tendo maior influência no desempenho dos saltos. Observou-se tendência de diminuição do índice de assimetria para a ação muscular do membro contralateral fatigado, observado através de eletromiografia. Através dos dados sugere-se que exista um comando comum onde o sistema nervoso considere os músculos ativados simultaneamente como uma unidade, exceto em condições de fadiga unilateral.

Santos, Marcelo Saldanha Aoki, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2015|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|21|3|224-229||Introduction: Stretching exercises have been related to a performance deficit on strength-dependent activities. However, little is known about its effect on multiple sets of strength training. Objective: To determine the effect of an extensive stretching protocol on the performance of multiple sets and soreness in strength training. Methods: The sample was composed by 12 trained-men, experienced in strength training. The protocol consisted of three sessions. The first session was used as a familiarization and load determination to 10 maximum repetitions (T10RM). The second and third conditions were randomized between subjects, and the bench press exercise (BP) was evaluated without previous stretching protocol (SEMA), and with previous stretching protocol (COMA). The stretching protocol consisted of six sets of 45 sec of stretch with 15 sec of resting intervals to the pectoralis major muscle. The stretching intensity was kept between 70 and 90% of the subjective point of discomfort. The local soreness was evaluated before and after exercise by a brief stretching and palpation. The Analysis of Variance ANOVA (2x6) was used to compare the maximum number of repetitions. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the load of the first set of each condition (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). The Student t-test was used to compare the total load and soreness. Results: A decrease on maximum number of repetitions along the sets was observed in both conditions, without differences between them, for the load of the first set, total load and soreness. Conclusion: The number of repetitions in multiple sets was reduced in the same magnitude in the conditions with … 
Paulo Marchetti |Efeito da ordem dos exercícios no treinamento de força|Enrico Gori Soares, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2013|Revista CPAQV-Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|5|3|1-14||Diversos estudos demonstram que a ordem de execução dos exercícios influenciam a performance neuromuscular em uma sessão de treinamento, e conseqüentemente as suas respostas ao treinamento. O objetivo do presente estudo foi revisar a literatura científica quanto aos efeitos da ordem dos exercícios na performance neuromuscular durante o treinamento de força. Observa-se que o efeito da ordem dos exercícios durante uma sessão de treinamento pode influenciar a performance neuromuscular quando realizados no início da sessão de treinamento quando comparada à sua realização ao final da sessão de treino. A percepção subjetiva de esforço parece não ser afetada pela ordem de execução dos exercícios e o sistema nervoso central parece alterar o padrão de recrutamento dos músculos em exercícios multiarticulares quando precedidos por um exercício monoarticular, aparentemente aumentando a solicitação dos músculos sinérgicos. Intervalos de recuperação maiores parecem afetar menos a performance neuromuscular quando comparados à intervalos menores, independente da sequência dos exercícios. 
Paulo Marchetti |Aspectos neuromecânicos do exercício agachamento|Paulo H Marchetti|2013|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida–ISSN|5|2|2013||Actually the strength training has been widely used in different contexts and for different purposes: athletic, recreational, esthetic and therapeutic. Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions imposed on the squat exercise may result in changes in the action of muscles, kinematics and kinetic, and consequently increasing or decreasing their performance and/or efficiency.

Eleven male Parkour practitioners and 12 male physical educators participated in this study and performed: pull-up test, handgrip strength dynamometer test (HSDT), p lyo metric push-up test, maximal horizontal ju mp, and maximal bipodal and unipodal countermovement jumps (CMJ). We calculated limb asymmetry for HSDT and CMJs and the bilateral deficit for CMJs. Significant differences were found between groups for the pull-up test (P= 0.002), plyometric push-up test (P= 0.039), bipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), dominant unipodal CMJ (P= 0.008), nondominant unipodal CMJ (P< 0.001), maximal horizontal jump (P< 0.001), and bilateral deficit (P< 0.004). The Parkour group presented higher performance than the active group, except for HSDT. 
Paulo Marchetti |Investigações sobre o controle motor e postural nas assimetrias em membros inferiores|Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2009||||||Durante diferentes atividades cotidianas ou esportivas o ser humano é submetido a desafios unilaterais que podem estar relacionados à performance de uma tarefa específica ou a própria manutenção de sua postura. Portanto, é natural o desenvolvimento motor de um membro em relação ao outro para tarefas específicas, desde que estas sejam repetidas de forma não simétrica. Desta forma, pode-se supor que sujeitos que possuam maiores estresses físicos unilaterais apresentem maior probabilidade em desenvolver assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas. O presente trabalho apresenta três diferentes experimentos visando investigar as assimetrias funcionais e morfológicas relacionadas ao controle de movimento para tarefas dinâmicas e estáticas em diferentes condições e grupos. O primeiro experimento visou investigar as diferenças, entre os membros inferiores, no controle de movimento entre sedentários e atletas, utilizando para isto a postura ereta quieta e o salto com contra-movimento nas condições bipedais e unipedais. O segundo experimento visou investigar o efeito da fadiga neuromuscular unilateral e bilateral no controle de movimento, entre membros, durante o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta bipedal. O terceiro experimento objetivou investigar o efeito prolongado da temporada esportiva no controle de movimento, entre membros, de atletas, utilizando o salto com contra-movimento e a postura ereta quieta nas condições unipedal e bipedal. Inicialmente, o presente trabalho concluiu que não parece existir relação entre as diferenças antropométricas e funcionais. Indivíduos sedentários e atletas …

PEREIRA, J.O. SILVA, A.K. YAMADA, P.H. MARCHETTI, R. VERLENGIA|2015|Gazzeta Medica Italiana|174|1|1-7||Aim. The purpose of this study was to determine how the execution velocity of eccentric exercises affects postexercise muscle damage in resistance-trained males using free-weight exercises. Methods. Twenty young males were divided by maximum eccentric strength into two groups: slow eccentric velocity (SEV, N.= 10) and fast eccentric velocity (FEV, N.= 10). Both groups performed four sets of eight repetitions with 70% of their one repetition maximum eccentric in a bench press exercise with a 2-minute rest interval between sets. Each group lifted an equal total volume load. The eccentric velocity was controlled to 3 seconds for the SEV group and 0.5 seconds for the FEV group. The 1RM test, delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and creatine kinase (CK) activity were evaluated before and up to 96 hours postexercise. Results. A significant reduction (compared with baseline values) in 1RM test was observed up to 48 hours postexercise for the FEV group, while a significant reduction for the SEV group was only observed at 24 hours. The FEV group had a significant increase in DOMS up to 72 hours postexercise while the SEV group experienced an increase lasting up to 48 hours. The serum CK activity increased significantly only at 72 hours postexercise for both groups. There were no significant differences for any of the indirect analyses of muscle damage when the values were compared between groups. Conclusion. In conclusion, a six-fold differ-

Paulo Marchetti |Comparison of the Postural Control Performance of Collegiate Basketball Players and Nonathletes|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Erin Heather Hartigan, Marcos Duarte|2012|Athletic Training & Sports Health Care|4|6|251-256||Athletes who play basketball are at risk for ankle injuries. Whether athletes demonstrate different postural stability and limb asymmetry during a quiet standing task compared with nonathletes is unknown. Fifteen collegiate basketball players and 15 nonathletes performed 3 trials of bipedal quiet standing for 30 s with 60 s of rest. Postural stability measures were obtained for each limb: integration of the resultant of the center of pressure (COP) speed (anteroposterior [AP] and mediolateral [ML] directions); COP area; and frequency (AP and ML). An asymmetry index between lower limbs was calculated for COP speed (AP and ML), COP area, and weight distribution. Basketball players demonstrated less COP speed (ML)(P=. 039), decreased levels of asymmetry for COP speed (P=. 033), and reduced COP area (P=. 005) and COP speed in the ML direction, compared with nonathletes. Whether this reduction influences …

ISSN 2318-8111. http://dx. doi. org/10.5935/MedicalExpress. 2016.04. 04. OBJETIVO: Este estudo teve como objetivo investigar o efeito de um protocolo de alongamento por facilitação neuromuscular proprioceptiva de contração-relaxamento sobre o equilíbrio dinâmico. MÉTODOS: Vinte jovens saudáveis do sexo masculino realizaram duas sessões oredenadas aleatoriamente; uma sessão com protocolo de alongamento por facilitação neuromuscular proprioceptiva de contração-relaxamento, e uma sessão sem esse protocolo. O equilíbrio dinâmico bipedal foi medido nas direções ântero-posterior e médio-lateral antes e após a conclusão das duas sessões experimentais, com os olhos abertos e fechados. RESULTADOS: O estudo mostrou que não há diferença significativa entre as duas sessões (com vs sem o protocolo de alongamento) no sentido ântero-posterior. No entanto, na direção médio-lateral, o protocolo de alongamento aumentou significativamente o equilíbrio dinâmico, quando comparado com a condição de protocolo sem alongamento. CONCLUSÃO: Este estudo permite concluir que o protocolo de alongamento por facilitação neuromuscular proprioceptiva de contração-relaxamento pode ser eficaz para melhorar o controle de equilíbrio dinâmico.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are susceptible to early muscle fatigue. The objective of this study is to investigate the acute effects of LED on muscle function, exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory responses during isometric and dynamic exercise in patients with COPD. This study will assess 30 patients with moderate to severe obstruction (forced expiratory volume-one second,FEV1 ≤70% predicted). Isometric and dynamic protocols will be conducted in two visits each, for a total of four visits a week apart. First, venous blood will be taken from the patients. The isometric protocol will start with the determination of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MIVC) to determine the workload (60% of MIVC) for the isometric endurance test (IET). Patients will be randomized to receive either the placebo or LED application (each point will be irradiated for 30 s and the energy received at each point will be 41.7 J). Immediately after finishing this procedure, the patients will carry out the IET until the limit of tolerance or until a 20% fall of strength is observed. After the test, another blood draw will be taken. In another visit (one week later), the same order of procedures will be performed, except with the opposite (LED or placebo). For the dynamic endurance test (DET), the same procedures described above will be followed, except with 75% of the maximal workload obtained from the incremental cycle ergometer test used instead of the IET. The electromyography will be recorded during the isometric and dynamic protocols … 
Paulo Marchetti |Parkour: história e conceitos da modalidade|Ana Luiza Martins Stramandinoli, Jarbas Gomes Remonte, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2012/8/17|Revista Mackenzie de Educação física e esporte|11|2|||O Parkour é uma atividade física baseada em uma proposta do Método Natural (MN) e do Parcours Du Combattant (PDC). O objetivo do presente trabalho foi revisar aspectos históricos, além dos conceitos fundamentais da modalidade Parkour. George Hébert foi o criador do MN, antagônico à ginástica e à especialização esportiva. Publicou as bases do MN, utilizando gestos naturais e o desenvolvimento físico completo. O PDC, idealizado por Raymond Belle, foi adaptado do MN e do treinamento militar básico. David Belle continuou o legado de seu pai, baseado no conceito de que o treinamento deve ser aplicado à vida real e às situações extremas. Concluímos que os aspectos conceituais e históricos do Parkour são fundamentais para definir sua identidade dentro do contexto da área da Educação Física. 
Paulo Marchetti |The central and peripheric fatigue: a brief review of the local and non-local effects on neuromuscular system|Willy Andrade Gomes, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2016|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida|8|1|2||The fatigue can be defined as a gradual reduction of muscular efficiency in producing strength and power for extended periods, and it may occur in a peripheral and/or central system. Several mechanisms and systems can be affected by fatigue, so it is considered multifactorial. Fatigue can affect different locations through a variety of mechanisms, leading to reduced the performance in the specific activity, or subsequent task. Interestingly, the process of fatigue may involve both the fatigued limb (local fatigue) or not fatigued limb (non-local fatigue). Thus, the aim of this study was to perform a brief review of the effects of neuromuscular fatigue protocols on physical performance. Several mechanisms are related to neuromuscular fatigue, however, factors such as the type of muscle fiber, the gender, the experimental protocol, or the fitness level may influence the effects of local and nonlocal fatigue.

Schoenfeld|2015|International Journal of Sports Science|5|1|39-43||The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of static-stretching (SS) session with (intermittent) and without (continuous) rest intervals between sets on the bounce drop jump performance, with the same volume and intensity. The experimental protocol consisted of (1) a brief warm-up using sub-maximal jumps;(2) a pre-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for each lower limb);(3) ankle plantar flexors SS protocol (intermittent or continuous) was used only for a single-lower limb;(4) immediate post-SS evaluation (passive ankle ROM and three trials of maximal single-leg jumping task for the stretched lower limb). Then, subjects rest for 30 minutes and the topics 3-4 were repeated with the other lower limb and stretching protocol. The intensity used for both stretching protocols was between 70-90% of the point of discomfort. There were significant decrease in jumping height performance for both stretching protocols: continuous (P= 0.001) and intermittent (P= 0.006). There were significant increase in contact time only for the continuous protocol (P= 0.025). Our findings indicated that both stretching protocols (intermittent or continuous) were effective to increase the passive ankle ROM, and to decrease the single-leg jump height, however only the continuous SS protocol showed increases in the contact time.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a influência do tempo de permanência no exercício alongamento sobre o desempenho do drop jump unilateralmente (unipodal). MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta por 16 adultos jovens hígidos, com larga experiência em saltos. O protocolo de teste consistiu em realizar três drop jumps unipodais máximos a partir de uma plataforma de 15 cm sobre um tapete de salto (Hidrofit (r)), antes e após duas durações (ie uma série 3 min. de um lado, e 6 min. para outro, a escolha foi de forma aleatória) de … 
Paulo Marchetti |Effects of a full season on stabilometric Parameters of team handball elite athletes.|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Maria Isabel Veras Orselli, Lúcio M. S. Martins, Marcos Duarte|2014|Motriz|20|1|71-77||It is unclear whether athletes change their postural control over the course of a full sport season, or become more asymmetrical with respect to their neuromuscular performance over the same period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a full sport season on the postural control of team handball elite athletes. Ten healthy, elite male team handball players performed bipodal standing (BP) and right and left unipodal standing (UP) during 30s. We used the RMS and speed of the center of pressure to describe postural sway. For the BP task, the sway was lower at the end of the season (p<0.005). For the UP tasks, the sway was lower at the end of the season only for the non-dominant limb (p<0.001). Differences between limbs were observed only at the end of the season (p<0.03). In conclusion, a full team handball season did not lead to deterioration of the athletes' postural control, but by the end of the season, the athletes were more asymmetrical.

J Strength Cond Res XX (X): 000–000, 2018—The purpose of this study was to compare the effect a split training routine with muscle groups trained once per week (SPLIT) vs. whole-body split training routine with muscle groups trained 5 days per week (TOTAL) on neuromuscular adaptations in well-trained men. Eighteen healthy men (height= 177.8 6 6.6 cm; total body mass= 84.4 6 8.1 kg; age= 26.4 6 4.6 years) were recruited to participate in this study. The experimental groups were matched according to baseline strength and then randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 experimental groups: SPLIT (n= 9) or TOTAL (n= 9). Prestudy and poststudy testing included 1RM for bench press, parallel back-squat and machine close-grip seated row, as well as an ultrasound analysis of the muscle thickness (MT) of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and vastus lateralis. After 8 weeks of training, no significant difference between groups was noted for all 1RM tests (p. 0.05 AU2). TOTAL induced a significantly greater increase in MT of the forearm flexors and vastus lateralis (p, 0.05). In conclusion, muscle strength increment is similar regardless of the experimental conditions studied; however, TOTAL may confer a potentially superior hypertrophic effect.

Bras. Ciên. Saúde)|8|26|||Muitos são os exercícios utilizados para o desenvolvimento dos músculos que envolvem os membros superiores (particularmente o latíssimo do dorso, peitoral maior, redondo maior, deltóide parte espinal e bíceps braquial). Diversos são os fatores biomecânicos do exercício pulley que podem seletivizar atividades musculares e/ou a efetividade do programa de treino como o deslocamento da barra em relação ao tronco, os diferentes tipos de pegada (supinada e pronada) e as variações no comprimento da pegada na barra. O entendimento destas variações técnicas do exercício pulley podem influenciar a correta prescrição durante o treinamento de força. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo revisar aspectos anatômicos, cinesiológicos e biomecânicos do exercício pulley e suas variações. Poucos são os estudos que analisam as variações na técnica do exercício pulley, mas puderam ser observadas que diferentes alterações mecânicas realizadas podem acarretar em mudanças na ação dos músculos envolvidos neste exercício, aumentando ou diminuindo a performance e/ou sua eficiência.

Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21,9 ± 3,4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4,6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p < 0,005) no período preparatório (13,71 ± 1,30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14,68 ± 1,51) e competitivo II (14,63 ± 1,22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p < 0,005) no período competitivo II (3,59 ± 0,30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3,80 ± 0,36) e competitivo I (3,86 ± 0,26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p < 0,001) no período competitivo II (1,18 ± 0,43) em comparação com o preparatório (2,50 ± 2,01) e competitivo I (2,10 ± 1,61).

Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular.

Os objetivos do presente estudo foram investigar o déficit bilateral e a simetria entre os membros inferiores de sujeitos submetidos à reconstrução do LCA e comparar com sujeitos não lesionados. Vinte adultos jovens foram divididos em dois grupos (LCA e controle). A tarefa consistiu na execução do exercício Leg Press (unilateral direita e esquerda e bilateral). O número de repetições máximas (RM) foi quantificado e então o déficit bilateral e o índice de assimetria foram calculados. Os resultados mostraram assimetria no número de RM realizada entre membros no grupo LCA (p= 0,005) e apenas o grupo controle apresentou déficit bilateral (p= 0,004). Conclui-se que indivíduos que realizaram a reconstrução do LCA apresentaram assimetrias entre membros, sem a presença de déficit bilateral.

Paulo Marchetti |La Respuesta Morfológica y de Rendimiento en el Entrenamiento de Pilates en Mujeres Activas-Ciencias del Ejercicio|Ticiane Marcondes Fonseca da Cruz, Fernando de Oliveira Rosa, Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Natalia Mariana Silva Luna, Thiago Antonio Fedele, Julia Maria D’Andrea Greve, Marcelo Bordalo Rodrigues, Rozangela Verlengia, Charles Ricardo Lopes|2017|PubliCE|||||El propósito de este estudio fue investigar la activación muscular y la fatiga después del entrenamiento de Pilates de alto volumen y las implicaciones agudas en el rendimiento de la fuerza y las respuestas morfológicas relacionadas con el tejido muscular de los miembros inferiores. Doce mujeres jóvenes sanas y entrenadas realizaron una sesión de Pilates con una Silla Wunda. En dos momentos distintos (pre y post-intervención), se registraron las imágenes de resonancia magnética (RM) ponderadas por el tiempo de relajación transversal (T2) y las evaluaciones isocinéticas de las extremidades inferiores. Hubo aumentos significativos en la intensidad de la señal T2 post-intervención en el glúteo mayor y en toda la porción muscular (proximal, medial y distal) del vasto lateral y del recto femoral. Hubo disminuciones significativas en: el rendimiento de pre a post-intervención en el pico de torque, el trabajo total y la potencia media del momento de extensión. Sin embargo, en el momento de la flexión, no hubo diferencias significativas en el rendimiento entre la pre-y la post-intervención. Los resultados confirman que el método Pilates, cuando se aplica con el control de variables tales como series de tiempo, repeticiones e intervalos de descanso, promueve una modificación de la fuerza muscular y el volumen de los grupos musculares afectados. La capacidad de manipular variables de entrenamiento cuando se aplica al aparato de Pilates promueve cambios agudos similares como se informó en estudios de entrenamiento de fuerza.

Paulo Marchetti |EFEITOS AGUDOS E ADAPTAÇÕES NEUROMUSCULARES DECORRENTE DA MANIPULAÇÃO DE VOLUME E DENSIDADE NO TREINAMENTO DE FORÇA|Enrico Gori Soares, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2017|Revista CPAQV–Centro de Pesquisas Avançadas em Qualidade de Vida| Vol|9|2|2||A manipulação do volume e da densidade no treinamento de força é realizada através do gerenciamento do número de séries realizadas em cada grupamento muscular e como essas séries são alocadas na sessão e na semana de treinamento. A manipulação dessas variáveis altera as respostas agudas e as adaptações crônicas no sistema neuromuscular. Portanto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi revisar os efeitos agudos e adaptações neuromusculares decorrentes da manipulação diária e semanal do volume e densidade no treinamento de força. A combinação da ordem dos exercícios, sistemas de treinamentos e séries realizadas tem demonstrado ser uma estratégia eficiente para aumentar o desempenho e reduzir o tempo da sessão de treinamento. Estudos prévios sugerem que o aumento da sobrecarga pode ser realizado através da manipulação das séries na sessão do treinamento e do número de sessões ao longo da semana. Quanto à frequência de treinamento, a literatura parece ser clara ao sugerir ganhos superiores de força e hipertrofia muscular quando duas a três sessões por grupamento muscular são realizadas na semana. Entretanto, frequências de até 6 sessões na semana para o mesmo grupo muscular podem favorecer o anabolismo muscular. A presente revisão conclui que em uma única sessão de treinamento até 30 séries por grupo muscular podem ser necessárias dependendo do objetivo e da população treinada. O desempenho agudo da sessão (volume absoluto, força e potência) pode ser melhorado por meio de diferentes ordens de exercícios ou sistemas de treinamento quando essas estratégias …

Paulo Marchetti |Discinese Escapular: revisão sobre implicações clínicas, aspectos biomecânicos, avaliação e reabilitação|Andre Serra Bley, Paulo Roberto Garcia Lucarelli, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2016|assessment|8|2|||A discinese escapular é caracterizada pelo movimento desequilibrado da escápula durante os movimentos do membro superior, sendo então apontada como um dos fatores predisponentes às lesões no complexo articular do ombro. A presença ou ausência da discinese escapular deve ser determinada durante um exame clínico constituído por inspeção estática e dinâmica da posição escapular e baseada nesta avaliação, a reabilitação inclui exercícios de alongamento e fortalecimento da musculatura escapular. O objetivo deste estudo foi realizar uma revisão sobre as principais características abordadas na literatura sobre a discinese escapular. Foram selecionados os artigos de maior relevância para o objetivo do estudo, entre os anos de 1999 e 2015. A avaliação estática e dinâmica da escápula, apesar de ser baseada num exame qualitativo, é um meio eficiente de identificar as principais alterações biomecânicas da escápula e dessa forma, capaz de auxiliar no estabelecimento dos objetivos de tratamento para esta condição.

Paulo Marchetti |Acute effects on performance of the vertical jump after back squat with knee wraps|Willy Andrade Gomes, Josinaldo Jarbas da Silva, Enrico Gori Soares, Erica Paes Serpa, Daniel Alves Corrêa, Vilela Junior, Guanis de Barros, Charles Ricardo Lopes, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2015/8|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte|21|4|257-260|Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina do Exercício e do Esporte|INTRODUCTION: Knee wraps can affect the muscular performance during high-intensity exercises by reducing muscle activation, which may influence the effect of post-activation potentiation, which depends on high intensity for the following power exercise. Objective: To investigate the acute effects on the performance with counter-movement jump (CMJ) after high-intensity squat with and without the use of knee wraps in resistance trained subjects. METHODS: The study included 14 men (aged 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, weight: 81±11kg, 1RM: 107±30kgf) resistance trained (>3 years). Three SCM were performed before and after three back squats at 90% of 1RM with and without the knee wraps. During the CMJ muscle activation (IEMG) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), jump time (JT), and impulse (IMP) through the force of vertical ground reaction (FRSV) were evaluated. RESULTS: The results show statistically significant differences for JT between post-back-squat conditions (with and without wrap) (P=0.044, TE=1.02), whereas the highest values were observed without knee wrap. For IEMG of VL significant difference between pre and post-conditions after back squat (with knee wrap) (P=0.029, TE=1.68) was observed, and the highest values were observed for the IEMG with knee wrap. No significant differences between conditions were observed for IEMG of GM and IMP. CONCLUSION: After using the knee wraps during the squat exercise, there was a reduction in the involvement of the vastus lateralis during the jump with counter-movement, affecting the contact time, but not the production of impulse and consequent …

MÉTODOS: A amostra foi composta de 12 homens experientes com treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira serviu como familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos, sendo uma realizada com a avaliação do supino reto (SR) sem alongamento prévio (SEMA), e a outra com alongamento prévio (COMA). O protocolo de alongamento consistiu de seis séries de 45 seg de alongamento por 15 seg de intervalo visando o músculo peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após o exercício, a dor local foi avaliada por meio de breve alongamento e palpação. A Análise de Variância ANOVA (2x6) com medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar a carga da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). O teste-t de Student foi utilizado para comparar a carga total com a dor. RESULTADOS: Observou-se decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições, sem diferenças entre as mesmas, para a carga da primeira série, a carga total e a dor. CONCLUSÃO: O número de repetições em séries múltiplas é diminuído na mesma magnitude com e sem a realização do alongamento prévio, além de não alterar a carga total e a dor percebida.

Paulo Marchetti |Investigações sobre o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome|Paulo Henrique Marchetti|2005||||||O músculo reto do abdome é um importante músculo da parede abdominal, responsável pela estabilização e função da coluna, tanto em atividades atléticas quanto em atividades cotidianas. Entretanto, pouco se conhece sobre o controle neuromotor de tal estrutura em atividades voluntárias, como os exercícios abdominais, e como as diferentes tarefas agem na ativação segmentada das porções musculares do músculo reto do abdome. Em geral, a presente dissertação teve como objetivo investigar o controle neuromotor do músculo reto do abdome em diferentes tarefas voluntárias através de quatro experimentos. O primeiro experimento teve como objetivo descrever as características morfológicas do músculo reto do abdome, em particular sua área de secção transversa, ao longo do comprimento longitudinal do músculo, utilizando as imagens do projeto homem visível (NLM). O segundo experimento objetivou o mapeamento dos pontos motores para cada porção muscular. O terceiro experimento investigou o controle neuromotor das diversas porções musculares em tarefas isométricas de baixa intensidade. E por fim, o quarto experimento investigou o comportamento das porções musculares em diferentes tarefas isométricas em condição de fadiga neuromuscular. Baseado nos experimentos apresentados neste estudo pode-se concluir que o músculo reto do abdome é uma estrutura extremamente complexa em sua arquitetura, sendo caracterizada por diversas porções musculares que se interconectam através de aponeuroses tendíneas, onde, possivelmente nenhuma fibra muscular atravesse seus ventres. Devido a tal …

MARCHETTI|2018|PLoS ONE|13|12|1-11|https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0208834|Resistance training (RT) is performed at distinct levels of intensity from the beginning to the end of exercise sets, increasing the sensation of effort as the exercise progress to more vigorous levels, commonly leading to changes on the facial expression of RT practitioners. The objective of this study is to evaluate changes in facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and the activation of facial muscles by surface electromyography(sEMG) at two different levels of effort during resistance exercise and to investigate the correlation between facial expression and exercise intensity and fatigue. Eleven healthy male participants [23±6years; 1.77±6 m; 78±10kg] performed a set of arm curl exercise at 50% and 85% 1RM until muscle fatigue. The Surface electromyography (sEMG activity was recorded simultaneously in areas of the epicranius muscle (EM) and zygomatic major muscle (ZM). Facial expression was recorded and blindly scored by five experienced examiners. Scores (0–5) were based on the level of activity of the ZM (lip corner puller—Action Unit 12-FACS) during exercise. Facial expression and sEMG data were obtained during the exercise at the first repetition and at muscle failure. The root mean square (RMS) of the sEMG amplitude of the EM was significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.75; and 85%1RM:p = 0.002,d = 1.54). The RMS values for the ZM were significantly increased between the first and last repetition (50%1RM:p<0.001,d = 2.67; 85%1RM:p<0.001,d = 0.50). The RMS values for the ZM were also increased in 85%1RM compared to values obtained from 50 …

Marchetti, D.G Behm|2018|Applied Physiology Nutrition and Metabolism|||1-9||Crossover and non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) has generally focused on large muscle groups. It is unclear whether fatigue of a small muscle can result in NLMF of a larger muscle. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of small muscle (first dorsal interosseous; FDI) fatigue on the force and activation of contralateral homologous and larger heterologous muscles (biceps brachii, BB). Fifteen right-handed, male subjects performed three pre-test index finger abduction or elbow flexion maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) on the non-dominant side. Subsequently, they performed two 100s index finger abduction MVICs on the dominant side (experimental [fatigue] group) or rested for 5 minutes (control group). Afterwards, a single MVIC and a 12 repetition MVIC fatiguing protocol were completed with index finger abduction or elbow flexion on the non-dominant side. Force and …

P.H.|2018|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte.|24|4|295-299||Introduction: The elastic knee wrap (EKW) is a device used by powerlifters, weightlifters and subjects undergoing strength training with the aim of stabilizing the knee joint and increasing the development of strength (carryover effect). Objective: To compare the effects of elastic knee wrap use on muscular activity of the vastus lateralis (VL) and on knee extension force during maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) on the knee extensor chair. Methods: The study included 18 healthy male strength trained (>1 year) subjects (age: 25.56 ± 4.84 years, total body mass: 81.83 ± 8.73 kg, height: 176 cm ± 5.17). Three five-second maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the knee extensors were performed with a 10-second interval between attempts, for each experimental condition: control (C), with elastic knee wrap (EKW), and with tensor (T). The performance of the knee extensors and VL muscle activity were evaluated. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the dependent variables (carryover, peak force, IEMG and Impulse). Results: For carryover, the use of EKW presented a higher value (74.21%) than the control condition (p <0.001, d = 0.96) and was 79.37% higher than the tensor (p <0.001, d = 0.97). Peak force was 12.2% higher in condition C compared to EKW (p = .018, d = 0.71). For impulse, the control condition presented an increase of 8% compared to EKW use (p = .015, d = 0.62). No significant differences were observed for IEMG. Conclusion: Elastic knee wrap use increased strength production capacity during knee extension. The removal of the mechanical effect originating from carryover during MVIC …

MARCHETTI|2018|Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte.|24|4|291-294||Introduction: The elastic wrap is widely used by different types of athletes and recreational practitioners of strength training in order to improve weightlifting performance. Objective: The objective was to investigate the acute effects of elbow wrap on strength performance, absolute volume, and rating of perceived exertion/discomfort during the bench press (BP) exercise. Methods: The experimental protocol was divided into three laboratory sessions. At the first session, a bench press familiarization phase was performed with (EW) and without (WEW) elastic elbow wrap. During the second session, the 1RM test was carried out in the bench press exercise under both EW and WEW conditions. At the third session, the repetition maximum (RM) test at 70% of 1RM (EW and WEW) was performed until concentric failure. After each session, subjects were consulted about their rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and discomfort (PSD). A paired student t-test was used to compare the values of 1RM and RMs with and without elastic wraps. Descriptive analysis was used for RPE and PSD. Results: For the 1RM test, there was a significant increase for the EW condition when compared to WEW (p<0.05). In the RMs test and absolute volume calculation, there was a significant increase for the EW condition (p<0.05). RPE did not differ in any of the conditions tested (p>0.05). PSD presented a high degree of discomfort with elastic wraps in all conditions. Conclusion: Elastic elbow wraps increase the load lifted in the 1RM test, and the maximum number of repetitions during the BP exercise, and consequently, the absolute volume. The elastic elbow wrap does not alter …

GOMES, J.J. DA SILVA, L.E. BROWN, P.H. MARCHETTI|2018|International Journal of Sports Science.|8|4|128-135||The aim of the present study was to compare acute neuromuscular responses and muscle thickness of a resistance training session with continuous-vs. grouped-sets. The experimental procedures were performed across three sessions in a crossover and random fashion. During the first session, all subjects were familiarized and the 10RM load was determined for both exercises: biceps curl (BC) and triceps extension (TE). The following two sessions were randomized for continuous-or grouped-sets. For continuous-sets, 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise (BC and TE) were performed sequentially, while for grouped-sets, each exercise was alternated every 4 sets until 8 sets of 10RM for each exercise were completed. Two minutes of rest was used between sets and exercises. Volume load and muscle thickness (biceps brachii, MTBB, and triceps brachii, MTTB) were measured pre-and post-exercise. Peak force and myoelectric activity (iEMG) were measured for each exercise (BC and TE) and each muscle (biceps brachii and triceps brachii) during a maximal voluntary isometric contraction test. Results demonstrated that volume load was significantly greater in grouped-sets for both exercises (P< 0.001). MTBB and MTTB increased after both sessions (P< 0.001), however, there was a greater effect with continuous-sets when compared to grouped-sets (P= 0.001). Peak force decreased for both exercises and sets (P< 0.05). iEMG decreased only after continuous-sets for both muscles (P< 0.001). In conclusion, continuous-and grouped-sets resulted in specific neuromuscular responses and similar muscle thickness for prime movers. Continuous-sets …

AOKI|2018|Asian Journal of Sports Medicine|9|4|1-5||Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of different rest interval durations between sets during full-body resistance exercise sessions on total load lifted and blood lactate concentrations in resistance-trained individuals. Methods: Ten healthy young men (age: 23±6.5 years; total body mass: 82.8±10.6 kg, height: 177.3±0.1 cm) randomly performed 3 resistance exercise sessions with different rest intervals between sets (30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds). The resistance exercise sessions consisted of 6 full-body exercises (bench press; seated low row; shoulder press; back squat; leg press 45 and seated calf raise) performed with 4 sets of 10 repetitions maximum (RM). Total load lifted (sets× repetitions× load (Kgf)) and lactate blood concentration were determined for each exercise session. One way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test were used for multiple comparisons. Results: The total load lifted was significantly (P< 0.001) lower for 30 seconds (26382.0±4100.3 kg) rest interval compared with 60 seconds (28864.5±4139.7 kg) and 120 seconds (30064.4±3966.4 kg). The blood lactate response was not different among the 3 rest interval conditions investigated, with mean peak values of 7.05±1.69, 7.26±2.77 and 6.90±3.79 mM for 30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds, respectively. Conclusions: In conclusion, rest interval durations of 60 seconds and 120 seconds between sets favored a higher total load lifted in the exercise session when compared to the 30 seconds rest interval. The rest protocols implemented in the present study promoted a similar metabolic …

Keeping the drop height constant, the variation of the landing technique can modify the performance and the mechanical characteristics of the jump. Objective: To evaluate the effects of different landing techniques on the performance and the reaction force of the vertical component of the ground after drop jump. Methods: Twenty-five healthy and physically active men (age: 26±8 years, total body mass: 75±10 kg, height: 175±10 cm) performed four landing techniques after the drop jump: bounce drop jump (BDJ), drop jump with 90° of knee flexion (DJ90), drop jump with 135° of knee flexion (DJ135), and drop jump with 135° of knee flexion with hands resting on the ground (DJ135A). Three attempts were performed for each technique; the subjects performed the drop jump falling from a 40 cm high force platform. The measures of jump height, contact time and impact were determined by the force of reaction of the vertical component of the ground, measured by the force platform, at a frequency of acquisition of 2,000 Hz. The repeated measures by ANOVA were used to compare the different techniques. Results: The BDJ technique presented lower jump height, shorter contact time and greater impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). The DJ90 technique presented jump height similar to the DJ135 and DJ135A techniques and a short contact time (P<0.001) and a lower impact than the other techniques (P<0.001). Conclusion: The highest jumps were observed for DJ90, DJ135 and DJ135A. The lowest contact time was observed in the BDJ technique, followed by DJ90 …

Na terceira idade, é maior a pré-disposição para as doenças crônicas degenerativas, dentre elas a osteoporose, considerada um problema de saúde mundial. As mulheres são mais suscetíveis a esta doença pois, além de terem menor massa óssea que o homem, quando chegam na fase da menopausa, apresentam maior descalcificação óssea, aumentando o risco de fraturas. Neste sentido, o treinamento de força é um grande aliado na prevenção dessa patologia, proporcionando bem-estar físico e mental, aumento da massa muscular e proteção dos ossos quanto a possíveis lesões e, se associado com algum método farmacológico, auxilia diretamente no tratamento da osteoporose. A presente revisão faz uma abordagem sobre a importância do treinamento de força em mulheres menopausadas e a profilaxia no desenvolvimento da osteoporose, favorecendo uma melhor qualidade de vida. A prática do treinamento de força proporciona à mulher idosa e portadora da osteoporose, maior flexibilidade e mobilidade, permitindo maior independência nas atividades da vida diária.

MARCHETTI|2017|Motriz|23|3|1-5||Aim the aim was to investigate the influence of a maximal isometric muscle action of the elbow extensors on the contralateral dynamic task of the elbow flexors. Methods Seventeen recreationally trained men (23.3 ± 4.9 yrs, BMI: 24.8 ± 2.2 Kg/m²) underwent two randomized different testing sessions separated by one week. In the control session (CON) all subjects performed a maximum number of repetitions test (RMs) at 75%1RM using the right elbow flexors. The experimental session (EXP) was similar to the CON; however, all subjects were instructed to perform RMs at 75%1RM by using the right elbow flexors and maintaining the maximal voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors during the test. RMs, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and training volume (TV) were measured and compared between sessions. Results The EXP showed a significant 10.4% increase on the RMs (13.8 vs. 12.5, p < 0.001, d = 0.44) and 12.1% increase in TV (238.0 vs. 212.4 kg, p < 0.001, d = 0.43) than CON. No differences were observed for RPE between sessions. Conclusion The maximum voluntary contraction of the left elbow extensors increased the RMs of the contralateral elbow flexors, reflecting a higher TV, and no differences in the RPE. Our results suggest that the investigated method may be a viable and practical alternative to increase the acute strength performance of elbow flexors when using submaximal loads. 
Paulo Marchetti |Effects of Squat Amplitude On Pelvic Tilt and Tibial Inclination|P.H. MARCHETTI, G.Z. FIORAVANTE, J.J. DA SILVA, W.A. GOMES, E.G. SOARES, S.L. PECORARO, F.S. FREITAS, R.A. MAGALHÃES, M.M.S. MIYATAKE, L.E. BROWN|2017|MOJ Sports Medicine|1|1|1-3||Strength training is commonly performed at two different knee flexion amplitudes: partial (to 90 degrees) or total (to 140 degrees). During these amplitudes, both the pelvis and the tibia are moved to ensure control of the center of gravity and displacement of the external overload. Forward or backward movement of the pelvic tilt may indirectly influence the internal load on the spine. Objective: To measure the effect of squat amplitude on pelvictilt and tibia inclination. Eighteen male subjects (age: 26±6 years, height: 178±7 cm, total body mass: 81.3±11 kg, resistance training experience: 5±4 years) were evaluated. Pelvic tilt and tibial inclination were measured by a digital inclinometer (Max Measure, USA, accuracy:±0.02, resolution: 0.05) during isometric squatting at partial and full amplitudes. The digital inclinometer was fixed on the sacrum and on the tibia, with aneutral spine position. A paired student t-test and a significance of 5% were used. There were significant differences in pelvic tilt between partial and full amplitudes (+ 32.4±10.9 and-21.7±12.3, respectively, P< 0.001). Maximum tibial inclination values were not significantly different between partial and total amplitudes (19.1±6.6 and 20.1±7.4, respectively, P= 0.225). It was concluded that the partial squat position produces anterior pelvic tilt while the full squat produces backward pelvic tilt. Inclination of the tibia is similar in both amplitudes of the squat.

No entanto, os reais mecanismos da possível ação do KT no desempenho ainda não estão totalmente claros. Portanto, o presente estudo objetivou realizar uma breve revisão dos trabalhos científicos sobre os efeitos da técnica do kinesio taping no desempenho de força e na atividade mioelétrica. Foram selecionados, dentre os artigos nacionais e internacionais, aqueles publicados entre os anos de 2004 e 2015. O emprego do KT parece afetar o desempenho de força ou atividade muscular na maioria dos estudos, entretanto, tais resultados observados devem ser considerados de forma cuidadosa, principalmente quanto aos quesitos referentes à técnica de colocação, posição e grau de tração. Outro fator que merece destaque é a diferença metodológica encontrada entre os estudos como a utilização de grupo controle e placebo, o poder dos estudos (baseado principalmente em um número pequeno de sujeitos avaliados), além da análise do efeito do tamanho; e desta forma, resultando em complicações na interpretação e comparação dos resultados.

However this practice can be negative to strength improvement and muscular power. Consequently, jump performance can be reduced after stretching exercises, depending on its duration and intensity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effects of different long-term stretching times on single-leg drop jump performance. METHODS: The sample was composed of 16 healthy jump experienced young adult athletes. The experimental protocol consisted of performing three maximum unipodal drop jumps from a 15 cm high platform, and landing on a contact mat (Hidrofit(r)), before and after two stretching times of the triceps surae muscles (i.e. a series of 3 minutes on one side and 6 minutes on the other, with the sides being randomly chosen), using an intensity of 70-90% of their subjective perception of discomfort. An ANOVA (2x2) analysis was used to verify differences for the jump height, contact time and flexibility, using a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between pre and post-stretching times of 3 and 6 minutes (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). Contact time was higher only for the stretching time of 6 minutes (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: We conclude that stretching exercises of the triceps surae muscle, for 3 or 6 minutes, resulted in a decreased performance in the single-leg drop jump, a decrease in the vertical jump height (for 3 and 6 minutes) and contact time (for 6 minutes only), reinforcing the need for more debates in this area regarding stretching before power activities. 
Paulo Marchetti |Propulsion Phase of the Single Leg Triple Hop Test in Women with|AS Bley, JCF Correa, ACD Reis, NDDA Rabelo, PH Marchetti|2014||||||Asymmetry in the alignment of the lower limbs during weight-bearing activities is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), caused by an increase in patellofemoral (PF) joint stress. High neuromuscular demands are placed on the lower limb during the propulsion phase of the single leg triple hop test (SLTHT), which may influence biomechanical behavior. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to compare kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity in the trunk and lower limb during propulsion in the SLTHT using women with PFPS and pain free controls. The following measurements were made using 20 women with PFPS and 20 controls during propulsion in the SLTHT: kinematics of the trunk, pelvis, hip, and knee; kinetics of the hip, knee and ankle; and muscle activation of the gluteus maximus (GM), gluteus medius (GMed), biceps femoris (BF) and vastus lateralis (VL). Differences between groups were calculated using three separate sets of multivariate analysis of variance for kinematics, kinetics, and electromyographic data. Women with PFPS exhibited ipsilateral trunk lean; greater trunk flexion; greater contralateral pelvic drop; greater hip adduction and internal rotation; greater ankle pronation; greater internal hip abductor and ankle supinator moments; lower internal hip, knee and ankle extensor moments; and greater GM, GMed, BL, and VL muscle activity. The results of the present study are related to abnormal movement patterns in women with PFPS. We speculated that these findings constitute strategies to control a deficient dynamic alignment of the trunk and lower limb and to avoid PF pain. However, the greater BF …

METHODS: 9 male boxing athletes (18, 8±1, 75 years old) were submitted to 4 identical (structure and volume) training sessions (TS) as follows:(A) jump rope, punching drills, hanging bag (1 movement per sec);(B) jump rope, punching drills, hanging bag (3 movements per sec). These sessions were considered as low (A) and high (B) intensity and each of them was repeated twice. To determine the ITL, we used the Rating Perceived Exertion (0-10) after 30'post training, and the indicated number was multiplied by TS volume (Foster et al., 2001). BLC was checked before and after TS using Accutrend Lactate (Roche). Lactate concentration was compared between high and low trainings using the Wilcoxon statistic test. RESULTS: The delta of lactate …

METHODS: Ten healthy adult (mean age: 26±8years) performed isometric curl-up (supine trunk raise with feet free) and leg-raise (supine bent-leg raise) exercises. In order to understand the potential selective activation of the RA, we conducted two experiments. In the first, subjects performed two controlled isometric exercises: curl up and leg raise at low-intensity. In the second experiment, subjects performed the same exercises, but they were required to maintain a force level in order to induce fatigue. We recorded the EMG activities of the lower and upper portions of the RA during the exercises and used spatial-temporal and frequency analyses to describe muscle activation patterns. RESULTS: At low-intensity contractions, the ratio between the EMG … 
Paulo Marchetti |Atividade mioelétrica máxima dos músculos vasto medial oblíquo e vasto lateral em cadeia cinética aberta e fechada.|André Serra Bley, Diego Barbosa Fonseca, Marjori do Prado de los Santos, Adriano Rodrigues|2011|Terapia Manual|9|42|54-58||Introdução: O alinhamento patelar, por parte dos estabilizadores dinâmicos, está diretamente relacionado ao equilíbrio na atividade muscular do Vasto Medial Oblíquo (VMO) e Vasto Lateral (VL). Alterações anatômicas e biomecânicas do membro inferior são comumente relacionadas com a etiologia da Síndrome da Dor Femoropatelar (SDFP). Estudos constataram que o controle neural não apropriado do quadríceps está relacionado a esta condição, principalmente quando a magnitude e o início da atividade mioéletrica do VMO leva desvantagem em relação ao VL. Objetivo: Avaliar a ativação eletromiográfica do VMO e VL, em contração isométrica voluntária máxima, em ângulos articulares específicos de 80 em cadeia cinética aberta (CCA) e de 30 em cadeia cinética fechada (CCF). Método: Participaram 12 voluntários (24±4 anos), sendo 9 homens. Foi realizado um estudo transversal aprovado pelo comitê de ética da Instituição. Incluídos apenas voluntários hígidos, sedentários, sem histórico de lesão ou cirurgia nos membros inferiores. Foram submetidos a aquisições eletromiográficas do VMO e VL, durante contração isométrica voluntária máxima do quadríceps em CCA a 80 e em CCF a 30. O sinal elétrico foi analisado através da atividade eletromiográfica integrada (IEMG) e então foram comparadas as tarefas (CCA e CCF) e músculos (VMO e VL) através de uma ANOVA (2x2). Resultados: Durante a CIVM, a IEMG dos músculos VMO e VL apresentaram diferenças significativas quando comparados entre tarefas (CCA e CCF)(p= 0, 02 e p= 0, 08, respectivamente), entretanto, não foram verificadas diferenças entre músculos para … 
Paulo Marchetti |VALIDAÇÃO DO TAPETE DE CONTATO NA MENSURAÇÃO DA ALTURA DO SALTO EM JOGADORES DE BASQUETE DE ELITE VALIDITY OF CONTACT MAT FOR MEASURING JUMP HEIGHT IN ELITE BASKETBALL PLAYERS|Paulo Henrique Marchetti, Fábio Luiz Ceschini|2010/3/22|Revista de Atenção à Saúde (antiga Rev. Bras. Ciên. Saúde)|7|21|||O tapete de contato tem sido utilizado em diversos estudos e possui grande aplicação prática no treinamento e no controle esportivo. Embora a plataforma de força seja considerada o “padrão ouro” na avaliação da certas variáveis dos saltos verticais, ela requer um ambiente de laboratório, assim como um alto custo para aquisição e manutenção. Consequentemente, os testes realizados no tapete de contato constituem uma boa alternativa para a avaliação de atletas na condição esportiva, quando, muitas vezes, o acesso a um laboratório se torna impossível e inacessível. Desta forma, o objetivo do presente estudo foi mensurar os critérios de validade do tapete de contato (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0-Brazil), comparando-se tais cálculos com os resultados do “padrão ouro” na plataforma de força. Quinze atletas de basquetebol de elite, categoria sub-21, foram submetidos a três tentativas do SCM no tapete de salto (Ergojump Jump Pro 2.0) e na plataforma de força (OR6-1000, AMTI). A altura do salto vertical foi calculada utilizando-se ambos os equipamentos. Os valores de média (±1DP) para a altura do SCM, medidos pela plataforma de força, foram 32.3±5.1 cm e, para o tapete de contato, foram 32.44. 5cm. O teste t de Student pareado não apresentou diferenças significantes entre ambas as formas de mensuração (p= 0.90). O gráfico de Bland-Altman foi construído para fornecer uma interpretação visual aos dados. Portanto, o presente estudo sugere que os SCMs avaliados no tapete de contato apresentam confiáveis e consistentes medidas para a definição da altura de salto comparadas às obtidas por meio de plataformas de força, e que …

Paulo Marchetti |The effect of dominant first dorsal interosseous fatigue on the force production of|Yimeng Li, Kevin E Power, Paulo H Marchetti, David G Behm|||||||Crossover and non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) has generally focused on large muscle groups. It is unclear whether fatigue of a small muscle can result in NLMF of a larger muscle. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of small muscle (first dorsal interosseous; FDI) fatigue on the force and activation of contralateral homologous and larger heterologous muscles (biceps brachii, BB). Fifteen right-handed, male subjects performed three pre-test index finger abduction or elbow flexion maximum voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) on the non-dominant side. Subsequently, they performed two 100s index finger abduction MVICs on the dominant side (experimental [fatigue] group) or rested for 5 minutes (control group). Afterwards, a single MVIC and a 12 repetition MVIC fatiguing protocol were completed with index finger abduction or elbow flexion on the non-dominant side. Force and electromyography (EMG) were measured from both sides. The force and EMG (median frequency: MDF) of nonexercised index finger abductors (IFA)/FDI and elbow flexors (EF)/BB significantly decreased after the fatiguing protocol. Compared with the control condition, the non-exercised IFA (12.5% and 5.7%) had significantly greater force and MDF fatigue indexes than the EF (5.2% and 1.7%).

Undoubtedly, one of the most widely used exercises in strength training, aiming at the development of the muscles is the squat. The present study aimed to review several anatomical, biomechanical and kinesiological aspects of the squat exercise, as well as their possible variations as differences in lower limb positioning, the effects in the amplitude of the execution, differences between guided and non-guided exercise and the differences in positioning of the bar related to the trunk. The understanding of several variations can influence in the correct prescription, correction and orientation of this exercise for strength training or rehabilitation. In this way, after the review of several papers about this exercise, we can conclude that the different variations and conditions … 
Paulo Marchetti |EFEITO DO ALONGAMENTO PASSIVO EXTENSIVO NO DESEMPENHO DE SÉRIES MÚLTIPLAS NO TREINAMENTO DE FORÇA|Paulo H Marchetti|||||||Introdução: Recentemente, a prática de exercícios de alongamento tem sido relacionada a um déficit no desempenho de atividades força-dependentes. Entretanto, pouco é sabido sobre seu efeito ao longo de séries consecutivas no treinamento de força. Objetivo: Determinar o efeito do alongamento extensivo no desempenho de séries múltiplas no treinamento de força. Métodos: A amostra foi composta de 12 adultos jovens, experientes com o treinamento de força. O protocolo consistiu de três sessões. A primeira delas serviu de familiarização e determinação de 10 repetições máximas no supino reto (T10RM). A segunda e terceira condições foram aleatorizadas entre os sujeitos. A primeira delas avaliou a realização do supino reto sem alongamento prévio (SEMA). A segunda delas avaliou a realização do supino reto com alongamento prévio (COMA). O alongamento consistiu de 6 séries de 45” de alongamento com 15” de intervalo para o peitoral maior. A intensidade do alongamento foi mantida entre 70 e 90% da percepção subjetiva de desconforto. Antes e após ambas as condições foi avaliada a dor local por meio de um alongamento breve e palpação. Uma ANOVA (2x6) de medidas repetidas foi utilizada para comparar o número de repetições. One-way ANOVA foi utilizada para comparar o load da primeira série de cada condição (T10RM/SEMA/COMA). Teste t de student foi utilizado para comparar o load total e a dor. Foi adotada uma significância de 5%. Resultados: Foi observado decréscimo no número de repetições ao longo das séries em ambas as condições. Entretanto, não foram observadas diferenças entre as condições … 
Paulo Marchetti |CONTACT: willy_edfisica@ yahoo. com. br|Willy A Gomes, Lee E Brown, Enrico G Soares, Josinaldo J Silva, Érica P Serpa, Daniel A Correa, Guanis B Vilela Junior, Charles R Lopes, Paulo H Marchetti|||||||Fourteen trained-men with at least one year’s training experience volunteered to participate in the study (age: 24±4 years, height: 176±6cm, body mass: 81±11kg, BS 1RM: 107±30kg). The experiment was performed in two sessions. During the first session, the maximal BS strength (1RM) was evaluated (without KW), followed by a familiarization with the use of KW. In the session two, all subjects performed 1 set of 3 repetitions (self-selected cadence) under 4 different conditions in a random order: with KW and without KW (NW) at 60% and 90% 1RM. A rest period (10 minutes) was used between conditions. The descent phase was parallel to the ground (~ 90º of knee joint flexion). The spiral wrapping technique was used. For the muscle activation evaluation, the superficial electromyography (sEMG) technique was used on vastus lateralis (VL) and gluteus maximus (GM), only in a dominant lower limb. The IEMG was calculated from the sEMG data (normalized by maximum voluntary isometric contraction, MVIC) during each trial. A repeatedmeasured ANOVA was used for all dependent variables ((wraps x intensity). Post hoc comparisons were performed with the Bonferroni’s test. An alpha of 0.05 was used.

Normalmente, indivíduos treinados realizam entre 20 e 25 series para cada grupo muscular em uma única sessão. Adicionalmente a prática do treinamento de força, a fim aumentar a amplitude de movimento, a realização de alongamento passivo é frequente entre os praticantes. Entretanto, a literatura científica demonstra que a realização de alongamento passivo extensivo tem sido relacionada a um déficit no desempenho de atividades forca-dependentes (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011). os possíveis mecanismos responsáveis pela redução da força após a realização do alongamento são:(i) a inibição dos estímulos excitatórios do motoneurônios alfa, via estimulação das terminações nervosas III, IV e órgão tendinoso de golgi,(ii) aumento do atraso eletromecânico devido a maior complacência da unidade musculo-tendínea,(iii) alteração na relação comprimento--tensão da unidade musculo-tendínea, e (iv) isquemia local devido ao menor fluxo sanguíneo e acumulo de metabolitos (Behm e Chaouachi, 2011; Marchetti, oliveira Silva et al., 2014).

Paulo Marchetti |Acute effect of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching protocol on dynamic postural balance|Amine Ghram, Mohamed Damak, Fatma Rhibi, Paulo Henrique Marchetti|||||||This study aimed to investigate the effect of the contract-relax proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (CR PNF) stretching protocol on dynamic balance. Twenty healthy young male performed two sessions in a randomized order; a session with CR PNF stretching protocol, and a session without stretching protocol. Bipedal dynamic balance was measured in anterior-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions before and after the completion the two experimental sessions with eyes opened and closed. Results showed that there is no significant difference between two sessions in AP direction. However, in ML direction, the CR PNF stretching protocol enhanced significantly (p< 0.05) dynamic balance when compared with no stretching protocol. This study suggested that CR PNF stretching might be effective to improve dynamic balance control.

Effects of circadian rhythm on power, force, and hormonal response in young men. J Strength Cond Res 30 (3): 725–732, 2016—Circadian rhythms (CRs) persist in many physiological systems related to performance. The effects of circadian patterns on dynamic muscular power are minimal and conflicting. Furthermore, no study to date has investigated the effect of CR on bench press throws (BPTs) despite its popularity as a modality to increase muscular power. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of circadian variations on muscular power output and hormonal changes in men. College aged men (n= 7, age: 23.6 6 1.3 years, height: 179.9 6 5.4 cm, and body mass: 81.5 6 19.7 kg.) were recruited for this repeated measures study.

Healthy young boys and girls, ages 3- to 7-years old, were tested for one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength, and 70% of 1-RM to determine mean power and mean velocity on the chest press and leg press exercises. Adult weight machines were modified to accommodate the smaller size and lower strength levels of the children. A 2 × 4 (sex × age) ANOVA was used to determine age and sex differences in performance. No interaction or sex differences were observed for any variable at any age. 1-RM strength, mean power, and mean velocity significantly increased across ages (p ≤ .05). When adjusted for body mass, the changes were insignificant, with one exception. Relative mean power …

Noninvasive assessment of skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain expression in trained and untrained men. J Strength Cond Res 31 (9): 2355–2362, 2017—Numerous conditions and types of physical activity (eg, exercise, aging, and muscle-related diseases) can influence muscle fiber types and the proteins expressed. To date, muscle fibers can only be characterized by actually obtaining a tissue sample using the invasive muscle biopsy procedure. Mechanomyography (MMG) is the assessment of the vibration properties of contracting skeletal muscle and has been proposed as a possible noninvasive method for muscle fiber analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to examine the feasibility of using MMG and muscle performance measures to noninvasively assess muscle fiber characteristics. Fifteen men (5 …

The purpose of this investigation was to describe the long-term response of ERK1/2 following circuit weight training (CWT), recreationally weight training (WT), powerlifting (PL) and weightlifting (WL). Independent t-tests were used to determine differences in trained groups compared to sedentary controls. Total ERK1/2 content was lower in PL and WL compared to their controls (p ≤ 0.05). Specific trained groups displayed large (WL: pERK/total-ERK; d = 1.25) and moderate (CWT: total ERK1/2; d = 0.54) effect sizes for altered kinase expression compared to controls. The results indicate ERK1/2 expression is down-regulated after chronic RE in well-trained weightlifters and powerlifters. Lower expression of this …

Justin Nicoll |The skeletal muscle fiber: A mechanically sensitive cell|Luke A Olsen, Justin X Nicoll, Andrew C Fry|2019/2/6|European journal of applied physiology|119|2|333-349|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|The plasticity of skeletal muscle, whether an increase in size, change in metabolism, or alteration in structural properties, is in a continuous state of flux largely dependent upon physical activity. Much of the past research has expounded upon these ever-changing aspects of the muscle fiber following exercise. Specifically, endocrine and paracrine signaling have been heavily investigated lending to much of the past literature comprised of such endocrinological dynamics following muscle activity. Mechanotransduction, the ability of a cell to convert a mechanical stimulus into an intracellular biochemical response, has garnered much less attention. Recent work, however, has demonstrated the physical continuity of the muscle fiber, specifically demonstrating a continuous physical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM), cytoskeleton, and nuclear matrix as a means to rapidly regulate gene expression following a …

Justin Nicoll |Thyroid hormones, performance, and psychological changes on overtraining in female distance runners|Justin Nicoll|2014||||||Statement of the Problem: Overtraining (OT) is common in endurance sports. Perturbations in the hormonal milieu are common throughout OT literature. Thyroid hormones (TH) are altered by energy imbalances, and these imbalances are often present in female endurance athletes. Thyroid hormones also regulate metabolism, energy production, and therefore they may play a role in commonly cited symptoms of OT in these athletes. Alterations in TH status often occur slowly, and research investigating TH and their relationship in overtrained athletes is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships in TH and commonly cited symptoms of OT in collegiate track and field (T&F) endurance runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field middle (MD; n= 9; age: 20.21±1.49 yrs; height: 167.86±5.04 cm; body mass: 57.97±5.05 kg; VO 2MAX: 53.62±6.04 ml/kg/min) and long (LD; n= 7; age: 20.47±1.53 yrs; height: 162.48±6.11 cm; body mass: 56.15±5.99 kg; VO 2MAX: 61.94±3.29 ml/kg/min) distance runners participated in a 14 week descriptive study. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4), were collected at the beginning of the indoor T&F (PRE) and end of the outdoor T&F season (POST). Dietary intake and vertical jump power (VJP) were tested at PRE, MID, and POST season. A fatigue scale was administered weekly, and percent change (ΔRT) in race time (season best vs championship performance) was calculated. Wilcoxon-sign ranked tests were used to determine changes in hormonal, dietary, and performance measures over time. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was … 
Justin Nicoll |Skeletal muscle signaling responses to resistance exercise of the elbow extensors are not compromised by a preceding bout of aerobic exercise|Björn Hansson, Luke A Olsen, Justin X Nicoll, Ferdinand von Walden, Michael Melin, Anna Strömberg, Eric Rullman, Thomas Gustafsson, Andrew C Fry, Rodrigo Fernandez-Gonzalo, Tommy R Lundberg|2019/4/10|American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology||||American Physiological Society|The current study examined the effects of a preceding bout of aerobic exercise (AE) on subsequent molecular signaling to resistance exercise (RE) of the elbow extensors. Eleven men performed unilateral elbow-extensor AE (~45 min at 70% peak workload) followed by unilateral RE (4×7 maximal repetitions) for both arms. Thus, one arm performed AE+RE interspersed by 15 min recovery, whereas the other arm conducted RE alone. Muscle biopsies were taken from the triceps brachii of each arm immediately before (PRE), 15 min (POST1) and 3h (POST2) after RE. Molecular markers involved in translation initiation, protein breakdown, mechanosignaling and ribosome biogenesis, were analysed. Peak power during RE was reduced by 24% (±19%) when preceded by AE (P<0.05). Increases in PGC1a and MuRF1 expression were greater from PRE to POST2 in AE+RE compared to RE (18- vs. 3.5- and 4- vs. 2 …

Justin Nicoll |MAPK Signaling and Intracellular Hormone Receptor Phosphorylation at Rest and Following Resistance Training|Justin Nicoll|2018/5/31||||||Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK, JNK, and p38 are a family of signal transduction proteins that respond to diverse forms of physiological stress including exercise. MAPK appear to mediate several adaptations to exercise skeletal muscle however most of their data are limited to cell culture, animal or endurance training study designs. Increasing evidence suggests they mediate translational efficiency and capacity. Further, recent data indicates they can regulate the steroid androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors via phosphorylation. However, there are no data investigating AR and GR phosphorylation in humans or their response to resistance exercise (RE). Thus, understanding how MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation respond during resistance exercise will give us better insight to their specific roles in muscle adaptation. This dissertation investigated the activation of MAPK and epinephrine receptor signaling to a caffeine containing pre-workout supplement during resistance exercise. Further, we also described MAPK expression and phosphorylated AR and GR in resting skeletal muscle between males and females. Finally, we conducted a training study to determine differences in MAPK, AR, and GR phosphorylation following a period of stressful resistance training. The results of this dissertation indicates 1) pre-workout supplementation improves performance but does not enhance MAPK or epinephrine receptor signaling early after RE, 2) males and females express different expression of phosphorylated AR, GR, and p38 at rest, 3) MAPK and phosphorylated AR and GR are activated after acute RE and are …

Justin Nicoll |The Effect of Three Different Maximal Concentric Velocity Squat Protocols on MAPK Phosphorylation and Endocrine Responses.|Rebecca A Kudrna, Andrew C Fry, Justin X Nicoll, Phillip M Gallagher, Michael R Prewitt|2017/12/27|Journal of strength and conditioning research|||||The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of three different back squat protocols on 2 intra-cellular signaling, endocrine responses, and power fatigue. Nine recreationally trained 3 males (X±SD; age: 21.4±0.6 yrs; height: 177.8±5.1 cm; weight: 78.7±9.7 kg), completed three 4 maximal concentric velocity squat protocols in a randomized order. Testing protocols consisted 5 of 5 sets of 10 repetitions at 30% of 1RM; 5 sets of 5 repetitions at 70% of 1RM; and 5 sets of 3 6 repetitions at 90% of 1RM. Average system power for each set was obtained with a tethered 7 external dynamometer. Pre-and post-exercise blood draws were analyzed for lactate, 8 testosterone, hGH, and cortisol. Muscle biopsies assessed pre-and post-exercise extracellular 9 signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 phosphorylation via western blotting. Cortisol, 10 hGH, and lactate increased post-exercise (p< 0.05), but did not differ between protocols (p> 0.05). 11 Testosterone was unaltered (p> 0.05). Average power was lower for the 90% protocol than for the 12 30% protocol across all sets (p< 0.01). Average power was lower after the fourth and fifth set 13 compared to the first and second set in the 90% protocol only (p< 0.05). The ratio of 14 phosphorylated-to-total ERK1/2 was higher post-exercise after 90% protocol only (p< 0.05). The 15 ratio of phosphorylated-to-total p38 was unaltered post-exercise (p> 0.05). Resistance load 16 appears to affect power fatigue across the five sets of resistance exercise. This study found 17 modest changes in ERK1/2 and no changes in p38 phosphorylation following maximal 18 concentric velocity squats. Exercise volume …

Surface electromyography signals were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) during an isometric trapezoidal muscle action with the steady force plateau set at 50% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The signals were decomposed to yield MUAP sizes and RTs for each MU. The AP slope was calculated via the MUAP sizes vs. RT relationships for MUs recruited between 10 and 50% MVC for each subject. Few MUs with RTs< 10% MVC were observed in young or old and, thus, these MUs were excluded from the slope calculation. FDI cross-sectional area (CSA) and echo intensity (EI) were quantified using ultrasonography. Possible differences in AP slope, CSA and EI between groups were examined with independent samples t-tests. RESULTS: OG demonstrated significantly …

Justin Nicoll |Beta2-Adrenergic Sensitivity Prior to Training is Related to ERK MAPK Down-regulation Following Resistance Exercise Overtraining.|Justin X Nicoll, Adam J Sterczala, Andrew C Fry|2016/5/1||48|5|453-453|LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS|Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) basal excretion, and beta2-adrenergic (β2) receptor content are altered after overtraining (OT). Recent literature implicates β2 signaling in the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and phenotype. β2 signaling in skeletal muscle involves the signaling protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). To date, no study has investigated the E-β2-ERK signaling axis in OT humans. PURPOSE: To determine if basal sensitivity of epinephrine (E/β2) and norepinephrine (NE/β2) were related to changes in ERK activity following a period of resistance exercise OT. METHODS: Sixteen males were randomized into an overtraining group (OT: n= 8, age= 20.6±2.1 yrs, ht= 179±10cm, body mass= 78.6±12.1 kg) or control group (CON n= 8, age= 19.8±1.7 yrs, ht= 179±6cm, body mass= 76.7±9.7 kg). The OT group performed 10 X 1 at 100% 1 RM daily for 2 wks. CON performed normal training 2 days/wk. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle and nocturnal urinary E and NE were assessed before (pre) and after (post) overtraining. Biopsies were analyzed for total-ERK and ratio of phosphorylated ERK (pERK) via western blotting. The ratio of pERK was corrected for changes in total-ERK content between pre and post training. Multiple regression was used to determine if E/β2 and NE/β2 (independent variables) were significantly related to changes in pERK (dependent variable) after training. Significance was set at p<. 05. RESULTS: When groups were analyzed together, E/β2 and NE/β2 at pre explained 64% of variance in the change of pERK at post (F [2, 13]= 14.4, p=. 001, adj. R 2=. 641). When analyzed …

RESULTS: The mean 1RM bench press, 80% 1RM bench press, and 20RM cable rows was 124.2±23.5 kg, 99.8±19.3 kg, and 51.0±7.24 kg, respectively. A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant decreases in volume for both TRA (set 1: 1632.7±386.4 kg; set 2: 1190.0±209.2 kg; set 3: 930.1±172.4 kg) and APS (set 1: 1579.1±332.8 kg; set 2: 1172.0±269.6 kg; set 3: 909.1±232.4 kg) as the sets progressed through the exercise session (p<. 001). These decreases were similar between both methods (p=. 471). There was not a significant interaction of volume between the APS and TRA groups (p=. 772). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there were no differences in volume between TRA and APS resistance session. The APS training appears to be a time efficient alternative to TRA resistance training.

Justin Nicoll |THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP, BURN OUT, AND PERFORMANCE IN COLLEGIATE FEMALE RUNNERS.|David J Sanders, Disa Hatfield, Justin Nicoll, Kathleen Melanson, Christopher Nasin, Deborah Riebe|||||||Overtraining (OT) frequently occurs in collegiate athletes. Currently, energy imbalance is considered the primary mechanisms responsible for OT. However, there is little research concerning potential early OT identifiers that coaches and athletes can easily monitor, such as sleep habits and daily fluctuations in fatigue. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between fatigue, sleep, perception of burn-out, and performance change over a track season in female collegiate runners. METHODS: Sixteen female track and field mid and long distance runners (age: 20.34±1.47 yrs; height: 165.17±6.08 cm; body mass: 57.06±5.44 kg; VO2MAX: 58.24±5.92 ml/kg/min) participated in a 14-week descriptive study. Sleep (latency, quality, disturbance, daytime dysfunction), burn-out (reduced accomplishment, emotional/physical exhaustion, devaluation), and fatigue surveys were measured pre-, mid-, and end of-season. Percent change in race time (season best vs. championship performance) was calculated and Spearman rank order correlations were run to assess possible relationships among the variables. Significance was set at p≤ 0.05. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between sleep latency and burn-out exhaustion pre-and mid-season (r= 0.555 and r= 0.558), sleep latency and performance mid-season (r=-. 729), and sleep related daytime dysfunction and all characteristics of burn-out end of-season (reduced accomplishment: r= 0.574; devaluement: r= 0.666; and exhaustion: r= 0.672). CONCLUSION: Monitoring sleep patterns and burn-out during a competitive season may be of use to coaches in order to … 
Justin Nicoll |Testing Modality is Vital to Determine Performance Changes in Overreaching Resistance Exercise|Justin Nicoll, Andrew C Fry, Loren ZF Chiu, Brian K Schilling|||||||CONCLUSION: Resistance exercise performance decrements were similar to previous investigations (1, 3). However, only dynamic RE (barbell squat) was sensitive enough to detect decreased performance compared to isometric RE (knee extension) in overreached subjects. Similarly, it appears power and velocity are more adversely affected by OR than measures of maximal force. Immediate mechanisms are not clear why only dynamic exercise was impaired in this study. Decreases in performance in the barbell exercise may be due to the greater reliance on more elaborate systems of neuromuscular coordination and muscle activation. This may further be supported by the finding that components of muscle performance that required higher speed output (power and velocity) were decreased in the barbell exercise. Periodically assessing power and velocity on barbell squats at 70% of 1-RM might be a useful tool for strength and weightlifting coaches during various stages of periodized programs to assess the efficacy of the implemented overload period.

The test was graded on a scale of 1-5. Grades 1 and 2 dealt with basic supine hip abduction they were not relevant and were not used in the study. Grades 3 to 5 indicate the participant’s ability to hold the leg against gravity, gravity plus moderate resistance or gravity plus maximum resistance. Therefore all participants were graded from 3-5 on strength of GM. ▪ Side lying hip abduction (Grade 3)-Side lying hip abduction (bottom leg bent). Leg extended at the kneed joint, slightly extended at the hip joint. Participant can abduct leg at the hip joint through full range of motion without backward movement of the pelvis, flexion or internal rotation of the hip. Side lying hip abduction (Grade 4, 5)-Same as grade 3 except with resistance from tester applied to the lateral aspect of the knee

Oito atletas profissionais masculinos com idade de 21,9 ± 3,4 anos, todos participantes do Campeonato Paulista de Basquete, divisão especial, foram sujeitos deste estudo. O macrociclo analisado incluiu 19 semanas divididas nos seguintes períodos: preparatório, competitivo I e competitivo II (tendo 4,6 e nove semanas, respectivamente). Os autores avaliaram os atletas diariamente quanto à percepção subjetiva de cansaço e carga de treinamento e monitoraram a potência de membro superior dos atletas através da quantificação de sua capacidade de lançar uma bola medicinal. Os atletas apresentaram menos fadiga (p < 0,005) no período preparatório (13,71 ± 1,30) em comparação com os períodos competitivo I (14,68 ± 1,51) e competitivo II (14,63 ± 1,22). Sua habilidade de lançar a bola medicinal diminuiu (p < 0,005) no período competitivo II (3,59 ± 0,30) em comparação com os períodos preparatório (3,80 ± 0,36) e competitivo I (3,86 ± 0,26). Sua monotonia diminuiu (p < 0,001) no período competitivo II (1,18 ± 0,43) em comparação com o preparatório (2,50 ± 2,01) e competitivo I (2,10 ± 1,61). Os resultados revelaram a efetividade na monitoração da carga e cansaço dos atletas através do método proposto para auxiliar na organização do treinamento durante um macrociclo.

Treze voluntários participaram do estudo e foram submetidos a testes de FM e RF (70% 1RM) nos exercícios supino e agachamento precedidos ou não de EFlex. O teste T pareado foi utilizado para comparação das médias nas duas condições. Os EFlex diminuíram a FM no agachamento (141, 2±34, 2 vs 132±34, 9kg; p= 0,007) e no supino (77, 5±21, 7 vs 71, 7±17, 7kg p= 0, 04). A RF no agachamento não sofreu efeito dos EFlex (16, 2±5, 7 vs 16, 3±6, 8 repetições p= 0, 48), porém, no supino a RF apresentou diminuição significante (11, 7±4, 8 vs 9, 9±5, 1 repetições; p= 0,008). Portanto, os EFlex reduziram a FM nos membros inferiores e superiores e a RF somente nos membros superiores. Essa diferença na RF estaria relacionada ao volume de exercícios de flexibilidade pelo tamanho do grupo muscular.

Conclui-se que indivíduos que realizaram a reconstrução do LCA apresentaram assimetrias entre membros, sem a presença de déficit bilateral. 
Nanci Carr |Social media policies: Managing risks in a rapidly developing technological environment|Nanci K Carr, Steven P Maier|2013|Mustang Journal of Law and Legal Studies|4||||With ubiquitous social media and corporate websites as integral components of our professional and personal lives, businesses large and small leave themselves vulnerable to issues related to reputational risk, employer liability for intellectual property infringement, false advertising, regulatory breaches, defamation, unfair competition, NLRB complaints, employment law, public policy, harassment and disclosure of trade secrets. Enterprises ranging from local restaurants to large multinational corporations are susceptible to a wide spectrum of time-consuming and potentially expensive legal and management problems without having developed and implemented detailed and thoughtful policies regarding the use of and participation in social media by employees. These policies must then be incorporated into the fabric of the enterprise, regularly updated and communicated as part of a consistent program of training and compliance. 
Nanci Carr |Intellectual Property Issues Associated with Biorepositories: Current Practices|Nanci Carr|2014/8/1|Atlantic Law Journal|16||||As technological innovation over the last 20 years has offered ever more opportunity for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic inventions at the genomic and proteomic level, the leading edge of medical research today is increasingly found slicing through large collections of biospecimens held in government, university and private repositories. Specimens are collected from a variety of human sources for a particular purpose and then stored for future research and study. Beyond the ethical and regulatory considerations that are rich with conflicting public interests, the determination of who owns the potentially valuable intellectual property rights must be weighed against the unfettered need to promote further research and innovation that follows from data sharing and timely disclosure of results and inventions. With that in mind, what are the current practices regarding the disposition of intellectual property rights, or economic interests therein, that arise out of the study of human tissue specimens held in biorepositories and the use of the biologic information each of those specimens contains?

Stuart Pardau |Alternative Litigation Financing: Perils and Opportunities|Stuart L Pardau|2011|UC Davis Bus. LJ|12||65||Alternative litigation finance (" ALF") applies to situations where a claimant accepts funding for litigation from an unrelated third party. Although this arrangement provides relief to claimants who otherwise are unable to afford legal representation, it poses the possible danger of unfair influence exercised by ALF providers through the use of usurious interest rates and unconscionable terms of the agreement. Other legal issues that arise out of the context of ALF involve champerty, maintenance, and barratry, depending on the jurisdiction. The release of confidential client information to ALF providers may constitute waive of the attorney-client privilege. Attorneys even face conflict of interest issues between their clients and ALF providers, and as a result, they may lose independence in their professional judgment. Furthermore, ethical rules prohibit an attorney from splitting fees with non-attorneys. Despite these legal …

LJ|33||1||Hydraulic fracturing, or" fracking," is a polarizing topic, having earned both staunch advocates who see its possibilities for the domestic production of energy and ardent opponents who anticipate dire consequences resulting from its environmental impact. The practice has resulted in over one hundred lawsuits filed by private plaintiffs, none of which have gone to verdict prior to the recent jury decision in Parr v. Aruba Petroleum, Inc. 1 Because its result did not rest on a conclusion that the practice of fracking itself constituted a compensable wrong, Parr neither vindicated the oil and gas industry by exonerating it nor validated critics of fracking. Instead, the decision, based on a single cause of action of intentional private nuisance, demonstrated that juries were willing to find in favor of private plaintiffs even without a showing that fracking itself resulted in direct harm to the lives and property of those living nearby. The jury …

Indeed, while many fundamental aspects of Real Estate Law are consistent nationwide, the requirements imposed upon sellers to disclose a death or other psychological element affecting the property vary by state. The proliferation and success of websites, such as DiedInHouse. com, which, for a fee, will provide a report of all deaths that occurred on a particular property, suggest that consumers nationwide want to know whether there has been a death on the property.

Wage theft is “the illegal refusal by an employer to pay a worker the wages and benefits that he or she has legally earned.” In the United States, employer violation of wage and hour laws is a vast and enduring problem affecting as many as two-thirds of workers. In an attempt to combat this epidemic threat to hourly workers’ bottom lines, legislatures have fashioned numerous laws, some even invoking the power of “wage theft” terminology, such as New York’s Wage Theft Prevention Act. However, despite the pervasive usage of the term “wage theft” by the media, politicians, and pundits, a search of the term “wage theft” in legal libraries yields little precedent. This begs the question: can employers be liable for conversion for failing to compensate employees for time-spent working? The efficacy of conversion claims in wage-related lawsuits remains an unsettled question. However, if as a society, we are sounding the alarm in every incidence of possible wage and hour law violations, we ultimately misinform the population of potential plaintiffs regarding the viability of a claim for theft, or conversion, of earned yet unpaid wages.

Consequently, the shareholders priorities of return and risk continuously shift. However, their expectations of gaining value from the SoS are enhancing. One way of enhancing value from the SoS is by having the right amount of flexibility associated with it. Flexibility can be defined as the ability of a system to be able to adapt and cope with the changing environment. SoS flexibility means creating options at various levels, developing ways and means of change across the range of options. One possible way of creating enterprise flexibility is by outsourcing certain functions which would help affect the flexibility of an organization. The outsourcing done might also have an effect on each of the building blocks of SoS Flexibility. In this paper, we will look at how outsourcing could affect each of the …

Topics covered include the significance of historical context, a basic introduction to systems, and a discussion of foregoing works in System of Systems (SoS), Enterprises, and Complex Systems (CSs), along with their corresponding Engineering efforts. Chapter 1 emphasizes recent history through briefly introducing and listing importance of research, which, to the extent readers delve into some of the many references, will further enhance the understanding and heighten the appreciation of the subsequent material of the book. Chapter 2 focuses on the relevant aspects of complex systems and includes many additional references from that domain and complexity theory. In Chapter 3 the critical role of case studies in furthering the practice of systems engineering (SE) in all these forms, particularly for engineering leadership, management, and education, is advocated. The remaining book chapters contain the actual case studies. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Social Entrepreneurial Ventures: On the Edge of Chaos?|Colleen Robb, S Jimmy Gandhi|2016/1/1|Entrepreneurship Research Journal|6|1|111-133|De Gruyter|This paper proposes that social entrepreneurial ventures (SEVs) operate as systems of systems (SoS), a collection of complex systems working together to achieve an overall outcome in line with its mission. Previous literature shows that complexity theory is applicable to the unique structure of SEVs and the dual goals of creating economic and social value. We argue that not only are SEVs complex systems, but also operate as a SoS. As such, SEVs could greatly benefit from a general systemic risk management approach that is often applied to SoS. In order to explain our position, we consider an example of an existing SEV and apply these concepts to their operations. We also identify systemic risks in the example and show how the application of a systemic risk management approach can benefit SEVs. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|A case study: the New York city yellow cab system of systems|S Jimmy Gandhi, Alex Gorod, Brian Sauser|2011/6/27||||282-287|IEEE|In recent years there has been a significant increase in the amount of research done in the field of system of systems engineering. Despite many attempts, there is still a lack of a unified definition and standards for Systems of Systems (SoS). Case study research provides us with an opportunity to extract best practices from real life system of systems cases and set much needed guidelines for SoS governance. The yellow cab case is a well documented example of a System of Systems, which consists of multiple integrated complex systems working together to achieve the objective of transporting passengers in New York City in a safe and efficient manner. The best practices of the yellow cab SoS can be implemented in other SoS domains and the questions developed could be used for discussions in a class setting. Furthermore, these questions could be extended and applied to analyze other SoS cases in a similar … 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|A Systemic Approach to Adopting Effective Management Styles Based on Typology of Systems|Mo Mansouri, Alex Gorod, Brian Sauser, S Jimmy Gandhi|2009/10/14||||||Systems in today’s business environment have been categorized into certain forms based on their characteristics. The typology of systems based on flexibility is an example of such efforts in literature. However, more research on choosing effective styles for managing each category based on the right degree of freedom and level of control is required. In this paper, the spectrum of existing managerial approaches is described. Understanding available methodologies helps decision makers to select a more appropriate management style for the specific category of system. To do that, the four categories of systems based on flexibility are analyzed and mapped with the existing management styles, which are identified and described in this research. The proposed method can increase the overall effectiveness of management practices in the field of engineering management. The mapping approach proposed in this research can also decrease the complexity associated with management techniques in modern dynamic environment. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|On the importance and value of case studies|Brian E White, S Jimmy Gandhi, Alex Gorod, Vernon Ireland, Brian Sauser|2013/4/15||||114-122|IEEE|Case studies provide a means for highlighting and extracting practical principles and methods for shaping and accelerating progress in solving wicked real world problems. They inform burgeoning theories such as those associated with complex systems engineering where people are considered part of the system to be conceived, developed, fielded, and operated; or extant systems targeted for improvement upgrades. This paper advocates for the value of case studies and summarizes some important examples. Motivations and ideas for increasing the use of case studies in the world's most difficult present and future systems engineering environments are suggested.

Expo., ASEE, New Orleans, USA|||27136||Career Pathways is a Workforce Development (WFD) program that is supported by State government to instill specific skillsets in K-12 students. Career pathways generally consist of partnerships between K-12 school districts, community colleges, four-year universities and community-based workforce investment boards. The overall goal is to bridge the gap between industry-needed skills and those obtained through formal education. The expected outcome is the transition of students into industry after high school, transfer into a community college, or seek a four-year college degree. Regardless of the career pathway outcome, the WFD program inculcates hands-on, practical skills in participants. These skills were included based on industry feedback about the gap between current graduates’ skills and those expected in the field of practice. The skills were also echoed in the ‘Engineer of 2020’report by the National Academy of Engineering. As a result, the career pathways include programs and services that addresses aforementioned skill gap and increases the employability of students; particularly in the hightech industry. The overall emphasis of this effort is on the engineering profession, in which the responsibilities and expectations from an employee in the 21st century are significantly different from those required decades ago. At California State University Northridge, the authors have collaborated with a local community college, two local school districts and a local workforce development investment center to create two separate pathways focused on Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship as well as Digital Manufacturing.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|A comprehensive review of entrepreneurship course offering in engineering programs|S Gandhi, MB Jimmy, S Taghazadeh|2016|Proceedings|||||Entrepreneurship education is becoming increasingly important in engineering schools. This is a trend that started several years ago in the US and is also spreading internationally. This trend appears to be due to the fact that engineers are responsible for providing solutions to enhance the quality of life for people worldwide and for facing the challenges related to that responsibility. As society develops we face new challenges, which call for varied and innovative approaches to solve these problems. This is further confirmed by the National Academy of Engineers’ book titled “The Engineer of 2020”, which the clearly discusses the changing role of the engineer in 2020 7. This process of evolving as a profession cannot be achieved unless an entrepreneurial mindset is created amongst the engineers of 2020 and beyond. To foster this entrepreneurial mindset, engineering programs are undertaking various initiatives. However, there is no clear agreement regarding the entrepreneurship content that should be included for engineers.

This shiftof" economic resources" within geographical boundaries are usually influenced by factors" local" to the immediate environment of the economic activities. In addition, movement of resources to achieve" higher productivity and greater yield" requires a" natural" understanding of the interrelationship between capital and labor. Application of such understanding to solve a particular human problem is often referred to as innovation. The entrepreneur is a business leader who looks for ideas and puts them into effect thereby fostering economic growth and development of a region. And entrepreneurship is one of the most important inputs for the economic development of a country …

As part of this effort to instill innovation and creative thinking in engineers as well as update the entrepreneurship curriculum, the authors have implemented various topics on innovative thinking into the curriculum. These topics include Lateral Thinking as well as 6 Thinking Hats Applications. These topics were included in the Fall 2013 entrepreneurship syllabus and have received positive feedback from the students. In this paper, the authors will talk about what aspects were included in the curriculum and how they can provide value by being included in the curriculum. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Entrepreneurship Education: Engineering a Pracademic Approach|MD Wilson, Eric Holloway, S Jimmy Gandhi|2014||||||Innovation and entrepreneurship are becoming increasingly important as we rely on economies to create jobs around the globe. And yet, considering the myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21st century and ever increasing consumer power, the risk of entrepreneurial activity has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner and fundamentally change the teaching methods, curriculum, and research in entrepreneurship education. Applying the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) to entrepreneurship with similar rigor can increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. Still, faculty and administrators of engineering programs are hesitant to introduce courses into an engineering curriculum outside of engineering fundaments. The paradox, however, is that non-core engineering courses including leadership and engineering management can help students develop highly desired attributes that contribute to career and industry success. 
Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Curriculum design for sustainability of globally integrated manufacturing|Bingbing Li, S Jimmy Gandhi, Li Ding|2015|age|26||1||Integrating the scalable nanotechnologies into existing industrial systems is highly beneficial for improving the quality, capability and performance of almost all kinds of industrial sectors. However, significant sustainability issues and challenges exist in the practical integration and subsequent operations of the integrated macro-nano industrial systems, including increased waste generations, extra energy consumptions, additional greenhouse gas emissions, novel nanoparticle emissions for occupational and public exposure, etc. This paper will analyze which competence domains, a curriculum towards sustainable manufacturing should have and how a certificate program in “Sustainable Manufacturing” can be accomplished. This curriculum design is based on the experience of creating and teaching new graduate level courses “Sustainable Manufacturing” at Texas Tech University and “Energy Efficiency and Industrial Sustainability” at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. All segments of society must be educated to understand, environmental, economic and social connections within manufacturing systems engineering to facilitate sustainability. The innovations in technology and management play a fundamental role in solving the global challenge in economic development, while simultaneously preserving life, conserving natural resources and creation of social justice. This pilot study could be a pioneer for further countries in the world such as China, Indian, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, which would be interested in implementing sustainable manufacturing.

In fact, entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as national assets to be cultivated and motivated to the greatest possible extent. In today’s global economy, exciting opportunities for cross border trade exist like never before. As a result of this, international entrepreneurship and innovation have come to the forefront of discussions in recent times. International entrepreneurship can be defined as “… the process of an entrepreneur conducting business activities across national boundaries.” Alternatively, it can also be defined as,“… a combination of innovative, proactive and risk seeking behavior that crosses national borders and is intended to create value within organizations.” For international entrepreneurship, there are a slew of factors that have to be taken into consideration such as economics, type of economic system, political-legal environment, culture, acceptance to risk etc. In addition to understanding entrepreneurship in other countries, it is important for local entrepreneurs to understand the kinds of practices that lead to innovations in other countries.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|AC 2012-4002: APPLICATION OF CASE STUDIES TO ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING EDUCATION|S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||As engineering system complexity has increased over the years, numerous complex systems projects have failed due to the lack of an appropriate systemic perspective. Since the solution to this challenge is itself a complex system, educating and training our current and future technical leaders on these challenges, and providing suggested changes in their mind sets, is imperative. As an educational tool, case studies can be a platform through which the analysis, knowledge application, and drawing of conclusions can occur to facilitate coping with the most complex systems. Case study learning has proven successful in the training of business leaders with real life examples of the strategies and tactics used by leading businesses to succeed globally. A valuable characteristic of case studies is that they support a holistic understanding and interpretation of the systems of action or interrelated activities engaged in by the participants. However, case studies are not as broadly used in engineering management and systems engineering education. This paper describes the importance of case studies to engineering management and systems engineering education, discusses frameworks for their implementation, and presents a case study template that can be used as a guideline in engineering education.

And yet, considering myriad and dynamic business environments of the 21 st century and the increasing power the consumer controls, the risk of doing entrepreneurship has increased considerably. Consequently, we need to educate engineers in an innovative manner to be able to confront new-age entrepreneurship in a new light and thus increase the odds of being successful engineering entrepreneurs. In this paper, the authors will talk about a potential new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship education for engineers in the 21st millennium. This approach will focus on inclusive, key concepts from Quality Management, Systems Engineering, Globalization and Sustainability for the Entrepreneurship curriculum, as these are topics that need to be understood by potential entrepreneurs to be successful. A new curriculum that can be taught as a workshop or as courses in the entrepreneurship domain will be developed subsequently and presented as part of this paper.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|An Implementation of Continuous Improvement of The Engineering Man-agement Program at California State University, Northridge|S Jimmy Gandhi, Ahmad R Sarfaraz||age|24||1||More than two-thirds of all engineering professionals invest a significant portion of their career in managing and administering a wide range of technical engineering and research projects and budgets (CSUN 2012). As the engineering profession evolves, an increasing need has emerged for entry-level engineering professionals who have both a broad engineering background and the knowledge and ability to interface between the business and technical functions of organizations. It was to meet this demand that university X, introduced an EM program at the undergraduate level effective Fall 2009. Undergraduate engineering management majors learn engineering fundamentals, together with the art and science of planning, organizing, allocating resources, and directing and controlling activities in technological environments. The Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management equips entry-level engineers with knowledge of the business of engineering, making them valuable to their employers and ensuring future professional growth. For students who enjoy people and technology, the technical challenges of engineering, and the opportunity to integrate higher-level organizational considerations into technological decision-making processes, engineering management is an ideal program of study (CSUN 2014),(Becker, 2007).

This course curriculum design and research will include mapping engineering management courses between the Engineering Management Departments at Texas Tech University and California State University, Northridge and creating distributed project teams, by virtue of which the students would be compelled to work both traditionally (intra-university) and virtually (inter-university) and learn about managing partially distributed teams. Pedagogically, the researchers/professors will also be compiling information and lessons learned in coordination of this inter-university educational endeavor.

Shereazad Jimmy Gandhi|Evaluation of Intellectual Property Course Offerings for undergraduate engineering students in the Mid Atlantic Region|S Jimmy Gandhi|||||||For more than half a century the United States has led the world in scientific discovery and innovation. However, in today’s rapidly evolving competitive world, the United States can no longer take its supremacy for granted. The decline of the United States’ share of intellectual property (IP) is one indication of its loss of competitiveness. According to studies carried out by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004, the United States is losing its dominance in the fields of science and innovation. In January 2008 the NSF again noticed the decline in US technological dominance. Because innovative ideas tend to be developed by younger engineers or scientists, an area that cries out is the improvement of undergraduate engineers who are currently illiterate in IP, in general, and of the role of IP in innovation, in particular.

Bingbing Li|Life Cycle Assessment of Lithium Ion Batteries with Silicon Nanowire Anode for Electric Vehicles|Bingbing Li, Jianyang Li, Chris Yuan|2013|IEEE International Symposium on Sustainable Systems & Technology (ISSST 2013). doi: DOI|10||m9||While silicon nanowires have demonstrated great potential for application on lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles, their environmental impacts have never been investigated. For a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has to be used to evaluate the potential impact of the product from cradle to grave. In this paper, the LCA is carried out on the environmental impacts of a high performance lithium ion battery system with silicon nanowire anode. The LCA modeling is based on laboratory data, literature references and the Gabi 6 Professional Database on a 43.2 kWh battery system for an EV with 10 year life. The environmental impacts of lithium ion battery system are analyzed in the whole life cycle. Introduction: Electric vehicles (EVs) are more environmental friendly than conventional internal-combustion-engine powered vehicles and are expected to be used in large fleet vehicle applications in the following several decades worldwide. It has been predicted that the global market for EVs will expand from 1.2 m in 2010 to 6.1 m in 2015 and to 19.8 m in 2020 (Watabe, 2011). Current EVs are powered by lithium ion batteries. Current lithium ion batteries are made of graphite anode which has a relatively small specific capacity (372 mAh/g), and accordingly, can only power the EV for a limited driving range. In comparison, silicon has a high theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAh/g) and has been widely recognized as the ideal anode active material for next generation high capacity lithium ion batteries (Chan, 2008). Such novel lithium ion batteries, in theory, can power electric vehicles for up to 10 times the … 
Bingbing Li|Design and Analysis of Shape Memory Polymer snap-Fits for Active Disassembly|John Carrell, Hong-Chao Zhang, Derrick Tate, Chengcheng Fan, Bingbing Li|2009||||||Disassembly is becoming a mandatory step in the end-of-life processing for electronic products. More and more regulations call for the removal of hazardous materials and mandate the recovery of components and recyclable materials. It is then no surprise that research has continually looked for more efficient methods of disassembly. Of these methods, active disassembly is at the forefront. Active disassembly incorporates innovative fasteners, which under a special environmental condition will exhibit a disassembling or releasing action. The use of smart materials, more specifically shape memory alloys and shape memory polymers, has been extensively documented. For shape memory polymers, past research has shown innovative designs, such as thread-losing screws and deformable brackets. What has not been shown with shape memory polymers, however, is one of the most basic and common fasteners-the snap-fit. This paper examines the design and processing method for creating a shape memory polymer snap-fit and demonstrates its effectiveness as an actively disassembling fastener.

This paper mainly focused on effects of temperature field of preheating substrate on the cladding quality. Laser cladding process has the following experimental parameters: laser power, powder feeding rate and rotational speed. Three types of cladding powders were used: Ni60A, Cr12MoV and WC-Co. Experiments were conducted by using different substrate preheating temperatures and cladding materials, which affect the quality of cladding layers. Comparison and analysis of the three types of powders showed that under different preheating temperatures, the cladding layer is mainly affected by tensile stress. Besides that, the residual stress of cladding layer is always higher than that of heat affected zone and substrates. The best preheating temperature to test the residual stress for three types of powders are: 600℃, 400℃ and 300℃. For all three types of powders under different preheating temperatures, cladding layer and substrate have compact and uniform structures. However, when substrate is overheated the cracking will occur in the substrate. Under different preheating temperatures, the Vickers hardness is higher than that of heat affected zone and the substrate for all three materials. The preheating temperatures for getting the maximum hardness are respectively 300℃, 600℃ and 400℃.

Bingbing Li|An surplus asset management model for environmental impact analysis of EOL electronic products|Xueqing Qian, Hong-Chao Zhang, Bingbing Li|2009/1/1||||127-133|American Society of Mechanical Engineers|With increasing environmental regulations and waste management costs, environmentally conscious design and manufacturing (ECDM) and surplus asset recovery are becoming a more attractive approach to solve environmental problems. Any company that owns a collection of PCs, printers and other electronic accessories probably needs to manage these assets more effectively, but currently there is a lack of tools for effective management. Therefore, this paper discusses, from the viewpoint of an enterprise dealing with end-of-life electronic products, the recycling processes according to literature, and derives an integrated model on surplus asset management and environmental impact analysis. The primary objective of the model is to develop a certain tool for managing surplus asset within a corporate office and generate a decision making tool for those who are concerned with the environmental issues in the design or recycling phase. Based on this model, a prototype system is introduced in detail in this paper.

Bingbing Li|3D BIOPRINTING OF SCAFFOLD STRUCTURE USING MICRO-EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGY|Juan Xing, Xianli Luo, Juliana Bermudez, Matthew Moldthan, Bingbing Li|2017||||||Scaffold-based techniques are a vital assistance tool to support main structure and enhance the resolution of target structure. In this study, a custom-made micro-extrusion bioprinting system was built and utilized to fabricate different scaffold structures such as log-pile scaffold and two-ring scaffold. This approach showed tremendous potential because of its ability to produce microscale channels with almost any shape. We were able to fabricate these scaffolds by using a custom-made 3D bioprinter to print hydrogel solution, mostly composed of Pluronic F-127, then wash away hydrogen by phosphate buffer saline (PBS) after crosslinking of main structure. We were able to achieve the desired scaffold structure by feeding G-codes data into user interface (Pronterface) and then translating that model into a program that utilizes a customized programming language, which instructs the microfabrication printer nozzles to dispense the hydrogel at specific locations. This fundamental study will be used to print increasingly viable and complex tissue shapes with living cells.

Bingbing Li|Energy-saving Optimal Design Based on Transfer Function|Qingdi Ke, Hong-chao Zhang, Guangfu Liu, Bingbing Li|||||||Nowadays, in most of the product design, the designers have been emphasized with attention being given to the energy saving. Unfortunately, due to the diversiform and transformable energy, it is well know that energysaving designs are mostly depends on the experiments and experience which are time and money consuming. In the most product, since the efficiency of the energy sources and action mechanisms have been significantly improved, the energy consuming depends on the its transfer in the product. In this paper, the energy transfer between the energy source and action mechanism is analyzed and quantified, and the transfer function is established with the Band graphs theory. Then, informed by the control theory, the transfer function could be classified, and the important variable which is usually called “transfer parameters” in this function could be educed. Furthermore, with the adjusting the transfer parameters, the balance of input and output could be optimized for the least unwanted energy consuming in the energy transfer. Finally, the model and the method in this paper are validated by an instance of the typical mechanism.

Mark Rajai|Globalization of engineering curricula in the United States and abroad|Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Seyed M Allameh, Mark Rajai|2005|age|10||1||With globalization of corporations and multinational industrial complexes, engineering students need the expertise necessary to face the challenges presented to them as the result of globalization. Engineering curricula are affected as the result of globalization. Modern engineering needs to address new concepts in team management, communication skills, and problem solving. Outsourcing practices and NAFTA initiatives have further intensified the globalization of science and industry to unanticipated levels. A study will be conducted to examine innovative methods and practices undertaken by engineering schools across the United States and to create curricular paradigms such as the Global Engineering College (GEC) or virtual engineering college. The findings of this study will include the challenges these institutions face exploring and implementing the innovative concepts that they have undertaken.

These needs have created the opportunity for this proposed project. Here product teams must design and manufacture new products where the team members are not co-located in the same place at the same time [2]. It is important to introduce this into the classroom, because virtual interactions are becoming increasingly important as separated teams jointly develop products. Over the last few years, two problems have evolved in the teaching of new product development. First, one course was not enough to stimulate product creativity. The teams needed more instruction and experiential learning in order to develop innovative products with high market potential. Second, LMU's graduate students have had great difficulty meeting together in colocated teams due to their busy schedules, off-site travel in their jobs and driving long distances in traffic in order to meet with their teams. These problems could be solved by designing twosemester courses in new product development and entrepreneurship that utilized the internet for team collaboration. In this way the students would have more time to nurture creative products. Furthermore, the teams would be able to interact at their own convenience, which would enable them to save time by not having to meet as often as a co-located team. 
Mark Rajai|A survivability model for ejection of green compacts in powder metallurgy technology|Payman Ahi, Kouroush Jenab, Ahmad Ghasempoor, M Rajabi|2012|International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations|3|1|15-24||Reliability and quality assurance have become major considerations in the design and manufacture of today’s parts and products. Survivability of green compact using powder metallurgy technology is considered as one of the major quality attributes in manufacturing systems today. During powder metallurgy (PM) production, the compaction conditions and behavior of the metal powder dictate the stress and density distribution in the green compact prior to sintering. These parameters greatly influence the mechanical properties and overall strength of the final component. In order to improve these properties, higher compaction pressures are usually employed, which make unloading and ejection of green compacts more challenging, especially for the powder-compacted parts with relatively complicated shapes. This study looked at a mathematical survivability model concerning green compact characteristics in PM technology and the stress-strength failure model in reliability engineering. This model depicts the relationship between mechanical loads (stress) during ejection, experimentally determined green strength and survivability of green compact. The resulting survivability is the probability that a green compact survives during and after ejection. This survivability model can be used as an efficient tool for selecting the appropriate parameters for the process planning stage in PM technology. A case study is presented here in order to demonstrate the application of the proposed survivability model. 
Mark Rajai|Using database technology to improve STEM student retention: A total quality management approach to early alert and intervention|S Khoury, K Jenab, D Staub, M Rajai|2002|Management Science Letters|2|2|647-654||Students at risk of dropping out of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs often display signs that indicate they are at risk. A need exists to identify at risk STEM students early and to develop and implement effective intervention strategies that utilize the Total Quality Management (TQM) approach. Most of all, a database system is needed to track this early intervention process, if retention rates are to be improved. To address this need at a small community college in North Carolina, a system was developed and underwent a pilot study in Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. The two pilot groups were compared to the two control groups to identify differences in retention, course credit completion rates, and grade point averages (GPA). The first pilot group displayed no significant differences, while the second pilot group displayed significant differences in most of the areas analyzed in the study, indicating a database system can be used to improve STEM student retention. While the second of the two pilot groups displayed promising results, managerial and logistical issues, such as less than optimal instructor involvement, impeded success were identified. This paper will describe the design, implementation, and the preliminary results of this study and outlines the need for further research that confirms these preliminary findings. 
Mark Rajai|Operation and configuration-based analysis of dual-gripper robotic cells|Kouroush Jenab, Mehdi Foumani, Ahmad Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai, P Weinsierm|2012|International Journal of Agile Manufacturing|12|1|1-12||The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the cycle time in a robotic cell which is made up of several production machines and a hybrid robot with two grippers. The robot is used to load, unload, and move the parts. It can synchronously perform operations on parts and move forward between two production machines. Considering deterministic robot travel time, part processing time on robot/machines, and loading/unloading time elements, this study concentratedon examining the scenarios composed of the robot s moves in both inflexible and flexible robotic cells. Furthermore, each one of these scenarios was investigated for linear and circular configurations. First, the lower bounds of cycle time for such robotic cells were studied regarding varied structures, and then optimal cycle times were acquired. Finally, linear layout was compared with circular layout. 
Mark Rajai|Effects of Outsourcing and the State of Economy on Employers Hiring Practices of Engineering Graduates|Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Mark Rajai|2004|age|9||1||With the current sluggish world economy, manufacturers are resorting to several tactics to maintain lean budgets. Among these tactics are outsourcing engineering and scientific jobs to nations overseas. Another, is employing only those workers who can satisfy their immediate needs. These practices have economic implications for the employers since employment decisions are determined solely by the profit/loss calculations in a time economic exigency. It also has economic implications for engineering graduates in search for jobs with salaries commensurate to their education and skills. This paper will combine the results of a survey conducted by the authors on this subject with information from recently published studies. Literature and data gathered will be organized and tabulated to find correlations between manufacturing employers’ economic outlook and their hiring practices. The results will provide insight into the availability of jobs for students majoring in engineering-related degrees. 
Mark Rajai|“Student in the University”: A Format for Retaining Students in Engineering Technology|Keith V Johnson, Mark Rajai|2000/6|age|5||1||Student in the university is a freshman orientation course in the Department of Engineering Technology at East Tennessee State University (ETSU) that was developed during the summer of 1994. The course initially was an elective course that became very popular with our freshman students. Because of its popularity, it became a required course for all freshmen with less than thirty credit hours. The focus of the course was and is to foster relationships with students and faculty, help students verify their decision to choose engineering technology or help them at least make informed decisions centered on choosing a major. The course uses a variety of teaching strategies and innovative approaches of instructions to attract and retain students in the field. This manuscript details many of the approaches that are used in the course that has been proven successful. Due to the versatile content of this course, we believe other programs with similar orientation courses could benefit from our experience.

Mark Rajai|The economic efficiency analysis of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah Alkarashi, Mark Rajai, Kouroush Jenab|2014/1/1|International Journal of Business Excellence|7|5|565-576|Inderscience Publishers Ltd|In this study, the authors measured Saudi Arabia’s long-term economic efficiency in light of total factor productivity (TFP) using seven economic measurements. Measuring long-term input versus output in a country’s economy could provide sufficient data for measuring the efficiency in that economy in comparison to other economies. This study compared Saudi Arabia’s long-term economic efficiency versus Turkey, Malaysia, Israel and the USA, as a benchmark. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia falls behind other nations in all seven measurements, which is a significant inefficiency in the Kingdom’s economy. Analysing solutions such as improving energy efficiency, privatisation, education, governance and transparency are discussed in this paper. 
Mark Rajai|Development of microtesting systems: I. Tensile testing of metallic microsamples|Seyed M Allameh, Morteza Sadat Hossieny, Mark Rajai|2005|age|10||1||This paper describes procedures adopted for the development of microtesters, including microtensile and microfatigue testing systems. Small structures are known to exhibit superior mechanical properties attributed to their finer microstructure. This includes stress-life response at low and high cycle fatigue. The fatigue life of small structures involves crack initiation and crack propagation stages. While the crack initiation stage is known to be a significant component of fatigue life, experimental verification of its impact has not been performed. Using the compliance response of small LIGA Ni structures in load control mode and under cyclic loading conditions, the contributions of crack initiation and propagation to fatigue life were quantified. Instrumentation details of the development of microtesters, including the use of PID functions of Labview®, IMAQ Vision®, a piezoelectric actuator, and the results of fatigue tests will be discussed. 
Mark Rajai|Development of an integrated ergonomic CAD system for evaluating designs for human factors and safety|Mark R Rajai, Keith V Johnson|2002/10/1|Journal of Engineering Technology|19|2|14|AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION|This paper describes the integration of NexGen Ergonomics ManneQuin software with the industry standard AutoCAD, producing a system that provides designers with a powerful graphical tool to evaluate designs for human factors and safety criteria. Many researchers and designers have wanted a CAD-based ergonomic program for some time, and the absence of a truly integrated system was the motivating factor for program development. This paper explains the steps taken to integrate these two software packages. Designers now have an ergonomic CAD system to help design products according to the physical abilities and characteristics of end users. This integrated technology can potentially revolutionize the way products are designed and significantly reduce the alarming number of related injuries, thus saving millions of dollars.

Mark Rajai|Revenue and production management in a multi-echelon supply chain|Alireza Kabirian, Ahmad Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai|2013/12/8||||3330-3339|IEEE|This paper models a supply chain problem and employs simulation-based optimization to analyze it. The model represents a manufacturer of multiple products from multiple raw materials that has control over the price of the products. The decisions to be optimized in the model are ordering policies of raw materials, inventory control of finished goods, manufacturing capacity of each product, and prices set on the products. The uncertainties involved are lead times of ordering inventory and the demand of the products. We consider the case of periodic review of raw materials and finished goods inventories on discrete time. The objective is to find the best configuration of the system to maximize profit. We show how simulation-based optimization could find the best configuration through an example.

Mark Rajai|DEVELOPMENT OF AN AHP-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR SELECTING A PROJECT MANAGER|Seyed F Montazeri, Ahmad R Sarfaraz, Mark Rajai, Robert A Matthews|2011|TRY ACAMEDICS!|||83||Assigning projects to project managers is one of the most important activities in an organization. It can strongly affect the performance of organizations or the results of their teams. Most projects are normally assigned to project managers according to their expertise and experiences in organizations. In this study, the authors looked at a model based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to assign a project manager. It is based on the quantitative and qualitative managerial competencies of people who are candidates for becoming team leaders and project managers. This approach is more efficient when the scope of the project is broad and none of the functional departments take the lead over the project. In this case, the methodology can make the work of assigning a project to a project manager more scientific and fair. Also presented is a subject illustrated case for selecting the best project manager for a given project out of four candidates.

Mark Rajai|DEVELOPMENT OF A MODIFIED HEURISTIC METHOD TO OPTIMIZE A SINGLE MACHINE OPERATION|Mark R Rajai, Morteza Sadat Hossieney|2007|The International Journal of Applied Management and Technology|||6||This study is an extension of “A Heuristic Algorithm for Sequencing on One Machine to Minimize Total Tardiness” developed by JE Holsenback and RM Russell. They utilized a powerful theorem of Emmons to introduce a heuristic method, which uses Net Benefit of Relocation (NBR) analysis to determine which job should be placed in last position to reduce total tardiness of the schedule. Although their unique and simple algorithm resulted in optimal solution in many cases, it provided only sub-optimal solutions when the problem set possessed a multi-nodal earliest due date (EDD). We modified their algorithm by employing three new approaches in such a situations, resulting in average 15% improvement. we also extended their algorithm to include weighted factors (jobs with varying importance) associated with each job. The Modified Net Benefit of Relocation (MNBR) algorithm to minimize total tardiness on a single machine is introduced. Two examples employing the MNBR approach are also presented. 
Mark Rajai|Mass customization and its curricular implications for four-year degree programs in manufacturing technologies|Radha Balamuralikrishna, Kurt A Rosentrater, Mark Rajai|2006/10/20||||19-21||Mass customization is fast emerging as a popular business strategy which aims to also cater to individual expressed needs of end users at prices closely comparable to mass produced items. Companies are able to switch to this mode of operation by primarily making their own operations demand-driven, flexible systems and asking their suppliers to do the same. Customers by and large are delighted to be part of this new kind of supply chain and are willing to invest time to specify what exactly they want provided businesses are willing to keep their end of the bargain in terms of high quality, timeliness and prompt service. The probability of manufacturing technology graduates encountering demand-driven manufacturing systems that operate on a mass customization paradigm is very high per current indicators. This paper concludes with a synopsis of certain imperatives for inclusion in a detailed examination of the curricula in four year degree programs. Specifically, we suggest that students should be prepared to perform value stream analysis, work towards developing a firm’s core competency, and be able to analyze and improve supply chain operations. 
Mark Rajai|2006-2105: DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTER-UNIVERSITY ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION COURSE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY|Mark Rajai, Hank Javan, Seyed Allameh, Horold Wiebe|2006|age|11||1||Instrumentation is one of the most important courses of engineering curriculum. Almost all programs in engineering technology at undergraduate level offer labs and instrumentation. Also, most of the textbooks on instrumentation are written for undergraduate programs.

Mark Rajai|Cooperative Education-Innovative Approaches for Partnerships between Universities and Industries and High Schools|Ali Kashef, Mark Rajai, Akbar Eslami, Ali Setoodehnnia|2005|age|10||1||Over the last few years, continuous learning has become an essential element of job success, and workplace learning linked to career development has become part of the educational system of the future. Today, many industries are increasingly depending on cooperative education (co-op) and internship programs with universities, colleges and sometimes with high schools. However, they do not perceive how to start one or what is expected from them. In some cases, high schools aren’t aware of how to establish good relations and better communication with the industry. Some department chairs or administrators don’t recognize the role of co-op in the academy, or else they decide to overlook it. Therefore, co-op with a clear expectation and assessment should be part of student educational experience. Educators, students and industries will all gain substantial benefits from their involvement in this process. The objective of this paper is to make the university and high schools’ educators aware of the opportunities they could offer their students in industrial area. Students have the chance to experience the real world of industry with hands on experience simultaneously with the education they receive at school.

Mark Rajai|Development of a Virtual Center for Product innovation and Commercialization|Mark Rajai, Morteza Sadat-Hossieny, Robert Matthews|2003|age|10||1||It is estimated that nearly 90% of all new businesses fail within the first five years. Failure of these businesses is often contributed to poor planning and management of the company. Although there is help available for new businesses, it is often very basic and not enough to assist new companies to grow and survive in the competitive global marketplace of today. Therefore, a need exists for a comprehensive resource center to provide various assistance to new companies. The Virtual Center for Product Innovation and Commercialization (CPIC) is a proposed consortium between Northern Kentucky University, University of Kentucky, University of Louisville and Purdue University. Each university would provide technical assistance in the areas of their expertise. CPIC would be available for new entrepreneurs, start-up companies, and existing companies to use 24 hours a day. In addition to reaching a wider audience this virtual center would reduce overhead costs for the universities. From conception CIPC would offer a number of modules to assist new businesses, with additional modules and features added in the future. Another innovative aspect of CPIC is that it involves students from participating universities to work with faculty experts assigned to each module. Students, especially those majored in entrepreneurial fields will gain valuable practical experience in this process. In this article, we present the development of this unique virtual center in details.

Mark Rajai|Modifications of Engineering Management Program at California State Uni-versity Northridge|Alireza Kabirian, S Jimmy Gandhi||age|23||1||This paper discusses the structure, requirements, and teaching methods of a new Online Master of Science degree in Engineering Management (EMOL) to be offered through Tseng College, an extended learning wing of California State University-Northridge (CSUN). This new program is significantly different from the residential program currently offered by Manufacturing Systems Engineering and Management (MSEM) department of CSUN in a number of aspects. To come up with our ideas for restructuring the Engineering Management (EM) program, we first conducted a benchmarking effort, by reviewing various EM programs. In this paper, the authors have summarized the results of their research about similar programs offered in leading US schools. The authors are in the processes of implementing two categories of changes: first restructuring program requirements and then modernizing the teaching and delivery methods. These two together should modernize the statuesque to bring it to the state of the art education of EM. 
Mark Rajai|Conquering the hurdles of the tenure and promotion process for Junior Faculty Members|Keith V Johnson, Mark Rajai||age|6||1||The process of tenure and promotion can be a harrowing experience for faculty in higher education. A tenured faculty member is one whose job, with a few exceptions, is secured for life. These exceptions typically include the closure of the department,(although a good faith effort may be made to place them in a related department within the university), gross negligence, and sexual harassment. Tenure was designed to protect faculty from the volatile behavior and attitudes of administrators. The process generally occurs in the sixth year of employment and for many can be stressful. A candidate for tenure and promotion is evaluated in the areas of teaching, scholarship and service. This manuscript addresses tactics, strategies and approaches that were utilized by the author to overcome the tenure and promotion process.

The results of a survey and the role of Concurrent Engineering and latest technological innovations in enhancing US competitiveness in the world market are also presented. 
Mark Rajai|Development of an Integrated System for Design Evaluation|Mark R Rajai, Keith V Johnson, Robert Matthews||age|5||1||In this paper, two software packages (AutoCAD and Mannequin) are integrated to create an ergonomic CAD system. This developed system will provide designers with a powerful graphical tool to evaluate their design for human factors and safety criteria. An absence of a truly integrated ergonomic CAD system that has been desired by many researchers and designers was the motivating factor behind our efforts. Steps taken to integrate these two somewhat incompatible software is explained in this paper. Now designers have an ergonomic CAD system to assist them to design products according to physical abilities and characteristics of their human operators. Utilizing this type of technology could revolutionize the way products are designed and significantly reduce the alarming number of related injuries, thus saving millions of dollars. This integrated system could also substantially reduce the critical factor of time to market and lower overall cost of designing new products by allowing designers to test their products for human fit without having to build a prototype or using real subject.

Mark Rajai|LabView-Based Navigational Aids to Predict the Position of Automated Guided Vehicles with Ultrasound and Radio Frequency Sensing|Ravindra Thamma, Gregory Marshall, Hugo Cuervo Garcia, Mark Rajai|||||||This research develops a graphical LabVIEW virtual instrument (VI) ultrasonic distance measurement system based on time-of-flight theory to estimate AGV triangulation position. The distance measurement unit, or sub VI, communicates directly with the microcontrollers that contain ultrasound transmitters and RF receivers. The signal from the ultrasound receiver is processed via a custom-built circuit on the mobile unit. The sub VI generates a pulse of 40 KHz via a NI-6602 32-bit counter timer card. As the pulse is received and processed on the mobile unit, it then transmits an RF signal back to the RF receiver on the base unit. The counter timer card will repeat the signal to the sub VI to begin the distance calculation once the RF receiver captures a signal from the mobile unit.

This graphical representation, by incorporating associated socio-technical factors into an integrated framework, provides a big-picture to illustrate the context in which an accident occurred as well as the interactions between different levels of the studied system that resulted in that event. In general, analysis of past accidents within the stated framework can define the patterns of hazards within an industrial sector. Such analysis can lead to the definition of preconditions for safe operations, which is a main focus of proactive risk management systems. In the case of the Sewol Ferry accident, a lot of the blame has been placed on …

NPT, according to many credible references, is the primary step to ascertain well integrity during any offshore drilling. This paper introduces a three-layer, conceptual risk analysis framework to assess the critical role of human and organizational factors in conducting and interpreting a negative pressure test. This framework has been developed by generalizing the risk assessment model that was proposed by the authors for the analysis of the conducted NPT by the DWH crew. In addition, the application of the introduced framework in this study is not limited to NPT misinterpretation. In fact, it can be generalized and be potentially useful for the risk analysis of future oil and gas drilling as well as …

Reviewing the literature of the offshore drilling industry indicates that most of the developed risk analysis methodologies do not fully and more importantly, systematically address the contribution of Human and Organizational Factors (HOFs) in accident causation. This is while results of a comprehensive study, from 1988 to 2005, of more than 600 well-documented major failures in offshore structures show that approximately 80% of those failures were due to HOFs. In addition, lack of safety culture, as an issue related to HOFs, have been identified as a common contributing cause of many accidents in this industry.

One of the most populous and environmentally sensitive regions in the world, the (Persian) Gulf, is on the confluence of an exponentially growing number of two industries—nuclear power and seawater desalination plants—that is changing its land- and seascape. Method: Building upon Rasmussen’s model, a macrosystem integrative framework, based on the broader context of human factors, is developed, which can be considered in this context as a “meta-ergonomics” paradigm, for the analysis of interactions, design of … 
Maryam Tabibzadeh|An integrated system-oriented model for the interoperability of multiple emergency response agencies in large-scale disasters: Implications for the Persian Gulf|Najmedin Meshkati, Maryam Tabibzadeh|2016/9/1|International Journal of Disaster Risk Science|7|3|227-244|Beijing Normal University Press|Failures in complex technological systems could have multiple dire aftermaths, including many deaths and injuries. These events, such as nuclear accidents, pose serious threats and long-lasting health and environmental consequences to workers, the local public, and possibly the whole country and neighboring regions. Such failures, given interconnectivities and interdependencies, could also have spillover effects and threaten the integrity of other systems operating in the same area. There is an essential need for effective integration and interoperability among multiple emergency response agencies, possibly from different countries, in the case of an accident in a safety-sensitive industry that causes the release of hazardous materials or contaminants. This article proposes a generic integrated system-oriented model to address this urgent need. It has been applied to the Persian Gulf area and its waters …

Maryam Tabibzadeh|A proactive risk assessment framework to enhance patient safety in operating rooms|Maryam Tabibzadeh, Gelareh Jahangiri|2017/7/17||||263-274|Springer, Cham|Patient safety, as a main aspect of quality of care, has been a major issue over the last decades in the healthcare industry. The number of preventable medical errors in hospitals has been noticeably high. These errors are more likely to occur in intensive care units including Operating Rooms (ORs). Moreover, preventable errors such as operating on a wrong body part have serious consequences. This paper fills an important gap by proposing a framework for proactive risk assessment of operations in ORs through the identification and monitoring of appropriate Leading Safety Indicators (LSIs) to evaluate the safety of operations and generate warning/predicting signals for potential failures. These LSIs are identified across the six layers of the Rasmussen’s Risk Management Framework, which each represents a main group of involved decision-makers. These layers in our context, from top to bottom, are …

Maryam Tabibzadeh|A Signal Detection Model to Interpret Safety Tests in Offshore Oil Drilling|M Tabibzadeh, D von Winterfeldt, N Meshkati|2018|Proceedings of 2018 Probability Safety Assessment and Management Conference. Los Angeles, CA, September|||16-21||According to the findings of the US District Court on the BP Deepwater Horizon (DWH) case,“the misinterpretation of the negative pressure test was a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, fire, and oil spill.” It is noteworthy that the Negative Pressure Test (NPT) was not only specific to the Macondo well operations; rather it is a critical procedure to ascertain well integrity in offshore drilling in general. Therefore, the correct interpretation of this test and designing optimal responses is crucial for the safety of future offshore drilling. This paper uses signal detection theory and proposes a model to provide responses to warning signals in offshore drilling and, in particular, to optimally respond to the findings of NPTs. The structure and generic parametric equations of this model enable oil and gas practitioners to calculate a cut-off point value, as a threshold to accept or reject an implemented NPT, which is crucial in the …

However, with spot welding (1) structural performance of the joint may be degraded through heat-affected zones created by the high temperature thermal joining process, (2) achieving the double-sided access necessary for the spot welding electrodes may limit design flexibility, and (3) variability with welds leads to production inconsistencies. Selfpiercing rivets have been used before; however they require different rivet/die combinations depending on the material being joined, which adds to process complexity. In recent years the introductions of screw products that combine the technologies of friction drilling and thread forming have entered the market. These types of screw products do not have these access limitations as through-part connections are formed by one-sided access using a …

Tool wear plays an important factor in both machining uptime and quality, and since tool failure is related to the surface quality and the dimensional accuracy of the end product, it is essential to quantify and predict this phenomenon with the best possible certainty. One of the most common ways of tool wear prediction is through the use of low cost spindle current sensing technology which is used to measure spindle power consumption in CNC machines and relate power increase to tool wear. In this work, two methods of stochastic filtering (ie Kalman and particle filter) were used in predicting tool flank wear in machining difficult-to-machine materials through spindle power consumption measurements. Results show a maximum of 15% average error in estimation, which indicates the good potential of using stochastic filtering techniques in estimating tool flank wear. In addition, the particle filter was used for online estimation of a spindle power model parameter with uniform and Gaussian mixture models as the initial probability density functions, and the evolution of this parameter to the true posterior density function over time was investigated.

Modeling the residual stress profile is currently tedious and inaccurate. This study introduces a new method of understanding the residual stress profile in terms of quantifiable key measures: peak tensile stress at the surface, magnitude and depth of peak compressive stress, and depth at which residual stress becomes near-zero. Experiments in turning IN-100 and milling GTD-111 have been conducted and subsequent X-ray Diffraction measurements have been utilized to obtain residual stress profiles. Using a sinusoidal decay function fitted to measured residual stress profiles, these four key profile measures are extracted and then the effects of process parameters such as cutting speed, feed, cutting edge radius, and tool coating on these measures are investigated.

This feature makes these alloys a suitable candidate for power generation industry. However, high wear rate and tooling cost are known as the challenges in machining Ni-based alloys. The high wear rate causes a rapid failure of the tool, and therefore, fewer data will be available for model development. In addition, variations in material properties and hardness, residual stress, tool runout, and tolerances are some uncontrollable effects adding uncertainties to the currently developed models. To address these challenges, a probabilistic Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been used in this work. The MCMC method is a powerful tool for parameter inference and quantification of embedded uncertainties of models. It is shown that by adding a prior probability to the observation …

This study presents a new FE simulation-based methodology to determine the modified constitutive model parameters utilizing the force results from face turning experiments conducted for both Ti-6Al-4V and IN-100. In these simulations, material constitutive models have a great influence on the results and must be selected carefully to represent the correct material flow stress characteristics. Conventional modified constitutive material models with flow softening behavior are utilized and further modified to represent the thermal softening effect on the flow softening behavior, where the temperatures can be much higher than normal for machining these materials. Parameters of the temperaturedependent flow softening based material constitutive model for both materials have been determined by using an inverse methodology. Comparison of measured and simulated forces with the modified material models has shown close agreements.

They play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength, high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. Machinability suffers as a result of these properties and harsh machining conditions occur, resulting in high cutting forces and tool wear. To combat the difficulties in the machining of nickel-based superalloys, such as poor thermal diffusivity and high levels of abrasive wear, trochoidal milling was introduced as an alternative method of milling. This method of milling combines linear motion with uniform circular motion, reducing chip load in exchange for increased machining time. Industry is averse to its widespread adoption due to increasing cycle times when compared to conventional milling methods …

Syst|9|2|97-121||In this work, wavelet packet decomposition along with principle component analysis are utilised for feature extraction using two low cost sensing methods: vibration and power sensors, in end-milling of gamma prime-strengthened alloy. The high wear rate of this material induces a rapid transition from a sharp state to a dull state of the tool, and hence limits the number of available data for model establishment. To address this challenge, a neural network with Bayesian regularisation is designed and its performance is compared with regression and time-series models. A maximum of 4% estimation error for Bayesian regularisation neural network, compared to 33% and 17% estimation error of the latter models, shows the good potential of this technique when a limited dataset is available. In addition, the use of low cost measuring sensors in this paper aligned well with the industrial applications to detect and avoid unscheduled downtime in machining situations.

Low cost sensing technology for measuring spindle current is commonly deployed in the CNC machine to measure spindle power consumption for predicting tool wear. In this study, spindle power information was integrated into a Kalman filter methodology to predict tool flank wear in cutting hard-to-machine gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Results show a maximum of 18% error in estimation, which indicates a good potential of using Kalman filter in predicting tool flank wear. 
Durul Ulutan|An investigation of alternative path planning strategies for machining of nickel-based superalloys|Abram Pleta, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|2015/1/1|Procedia manufacturing|1||556-566|Elsevier|Nickel-based superalloys play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength and high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. These environments are largely found in the aerospace, nuclear power and gas turbine industries. Due to the properties that make them suitable for their end use they remain a challenge to manufacture. In the machining of nickel-based superalloys high cutting forces and tool wear occur greatly reducing their machinability. Although there have been multiple recent studies on the machining of such alloys, the field remains vastly unexplored. A limited amount of research has been done in tool path methods, as most previous research focuses on finding optimal machining parameters to curtail the difficulties in machining while keeping the tool path constant. An alternative tool path, trochoidal milling, has been identified to combat the difficulties in …

Researchers have been working on using assisted or augmented processes to overcome this challenge, with methods such as ultrasonically assisted, thermally assisted, vibration-assisted, magnetic field-assisted, and laser-assisted machining. Utilizing electrical assistance in manufacturing has not caught much attention due to its difficult-to-apply nature. However, it is possible to increase the ductility and machinability (through reduced flow stress) of certain metallic materials through the use of electricity. In this method, the electrical current resistively heats the material while aiding in deforming the material through the electroplastic effect.

However, these models usually cannot be generalized, due to the inherent uncertainties that exist in the process. These uncertainties may originate from machining, workpiece material composition, and measurements. A stochastic approach can be utilized to compensate for the lack of certainty in machining, particularly for tool wear evolution. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is a powerful tool for addressing uncertainties in machining parameter estimation. The Hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs algorithm has been chosen in this work to estimate the unknown parameters in a mechanistic tool wear model for end milling of difficult-to-machine alloys. The results show a good potential of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling in prediction of parameters in …

It requires no manual labor, can be applied on parts of any size, and produces no hazardous or polluting substances on many plastic parts. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing process in which parts are built by extruding thin layers of hot material through a nozzle. It has the advantage of producing complicated part geometries, and the possibility to change a design with no additional cost. This study investigates the use of laser polishing as an auxiliary post-process on Polylactic Acid (PLA) parts produced with FDM to improve the surface quality of final products.

Durul Ulutan|Wavelet based sensor fusion for tool condition monitoring of hard to machine materials|Farbod Akhavan Niaki, Durul Ulutan, Laine Mears|2015/9/14||||271-276|IEEE|Tool condition monitoring in modern manufacturing systems is gaining more attention due to the fact that excessive tool damage can cause workpiece surface deterioration and increase idle time. Therefore, monitoring tool condition from the initial to final stages of tool life is a task that is critical yet difficult, especially in hard-to-machine materials. In this work, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is used for extracting statistical features in the time-frequency domain of two low cost sensing technologies, i.e. vibration and power, in addition to Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. A Recurrent Neural Network is then trained with Bayesian regularization backpropagation method and the estimated tool wear is compared to the actual measured wear. Results show a maximum of 13% relative error in estimating tool wear which proves the effectiveness of implemented sensory data fusion … 
Durul Ulutan|Methodology to determine friction in orthogonal cutting with application to machining titanium and nickel based alloys|Durul Ulutan, Tuğrul Özel|2012/6/4||||327-334|American Society of Mechanical Engineers|Friction plays a very important role in machining titanium and nickel alloys. It is the source for the high amount of heat generation, and as a result, the excessive tool wear during machining these materials. The worn tool is known to create lower surface qualities with tensile surface residual stresses and machine-induced hardening at the surface, as well as high surface roughness. It is essential to create a method to determine how and to what extent the friction is built up on the tool. This study facilitates a determination methodology to estimate the friction coefficients between the tool and the chip on the rake face, as well as the tool and the workpiece on the flank face of the tool. The results are validated with experimental results from the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V and the nickel alloy IN-100.

Prior researchers have investigated the effects of cutting parameters on tool wear and as a result, tool life has seen significant improvement. However, these studies are not concerned with tool flank wear during machining; they instead focus on tool flank wear after a certain amount of cutting distance. This study proposes a new method of predicting tool flank wear during machining that has the capability of suggesting tool failure without directly measuring the tool. For this purpose, a detailed set of experiments on end milling of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V was conducted and analyzed. Then, the resultant force output, which can be monitored during machining, was used to establish a predictive …

Micro-milling is an effective process for direct fabrication of titanium components. This paper presents some experimental investigations on micromilling of Ti-6Al-4V alloy with uncoated and cBN coated micro-end mills. Micro-milling of straight channels are conducted and surface roughness, burr formation and tool wear are measured. A performance comparison of the micro-end mills is also provided. An experimental design is utilized to analyze the influence of process parameters on the quality of fabricated channels. Multi-criteria optimization studies are also conducted to identify the process parameters which minimize the surface roughness and burr formation concurrently.

Researchers mostly focus on energy conservation through increasing the efficiency of such facilities, optimizing energy supplies, and scheduling efficient production sequences. However, attention is seldom focused on holistic energy modeling at the level of process assembly lines. In this study, the problem of energy consumption during the automotive vehicle final assembly (FA) process is discussed. An energy classification in the final assembly department is generated to give more transparent understanding of the energy consumption in each category. Typical energy models of every energy category are presented to demonstrate the potential energy savings through a combined approach. Finally, considering the current status of most … 
Durul Ulutan|Predictive modeling and multi-objective optimization of maching-induced residual stresses: investigation of machining parameter effects|Durul Ulutan|2013||||||Description In the aerospace industry, titanium and nickel-based alloys are frequently used for critical structural components, especially due to their higher strength at both low and high temperatures, and higher wear and chemical degradation resistance. However, because of their unfavorable thermal properties, deformation and friction-induced microstructural changes prevent the end products from having good surface integrity properties. In addition to surface roughness, microhardness changes, and microstructural alterations, the machining-induced residual stress profiles of titanium and nickel-based alloys contribute in the surface integrity of these products. Therefore, it is essential to create a comprehensive method that predicts the residual stress outcomes of machining processes, and understand how machining parameters (cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, depth of cut, etc.) or tool parameters (tool rake …

An introduction to lightweight materials couples that of lightweight joining with a thermo-mechanical process, Flow Drill Screwdriving (FDS). This process is favored in terms of robustness, short installation time, and only requiring access to one side. The most significant challenge of this process is reducing the material sheet separation to minimize any possibility of corrosion buildup. Warm forming of aluminum has been shown to increase ductility and formability of the material and thus the process benefits from a reduced cycle time that leads to cost reduction. In this study, the effect of an auxiliary heat source on the flow of Al6063 is investigated for the FDS application. In order to accomplish this task, a …

For reliable results, CBM systems need early and reliable warning based on prediction models that use multiple types of sensors. In this study, tool flank wear during end milling difficult-to-machine alloys was measured using an optical microscope. Then, vibration data collected with an accelerometer was investigated for its relationship to tool flank wear. The developed relationship between accelerometer output and tool flank wear was validated with further experiments. It was observed from frequency domain responses of these outputs that specific harmonics of the tool pass frequency were dominant, and tool flank wear can be related to the amplitude of these harmonics during machining. This way, it was shown that through accurate online prediction of tool wear, premature interruption of the process …

Durul Ulutan|Prediction of Machining Induced Microhardness using Finite Element Simulations and Machine Learning in Titanium Alloys|YM Arisoy, D Ulutan, T Özel|||||||Titanium and its alloys are today used in many industries including aerospace, automotive and medical device. Ti-6Al-4V alloy is the most suitable because it offers favorable mechanical characteristics such as high strength-to-weight ratio, toughness, superb corrosion resistance and bio-compatibility. Titanium alloys are difficult-tomachine materials with considerable manufacturing problems such as machining induced surface integrity. In this study, the feasibility of predicting machining induced microhardness profiles by using finite element simulations and temperature-based machine learning predictive modeling has been investigated. 3D turning experiments are utilized to validate the FE simulation predictions. Predicted microhardness profiles are then utilized in understanding the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, tool material, coating and edge radius on the surface integrity. The study provides essential understanding in predicting machining induced microstructure alterations that are detrimental to fatigue life of titanium alloyed end products.

We compiled several fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sets to assess stock trends in the barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) in southern California, USA, evaluate the interaction between spawning aggregations and fishing activities, and test for hyperstability. Annual and seasonal trends from fisheries and population data indicate that regional stocks of both species have collapsed in response to overfishing of spawning aggregations and changes in environmental conditions. The aggregating behavior of fish and persistent targeting of spawning aggregations by recreational fisheries combined to produce a hyperstable relationship between CPUE and stock …

YOY halibut were most abundant in fully-protected waters; semi-protected waters contained one-half to one-quarter the number of YOY halibut. No YOY halibut were collected at the exposed coast site. Newly recruited halibut ranged from 8 to 12 mm SL and were approximately 20 to 29 days old. Gammarid amphipods, mysids, teleosts, and harpacticoid copepods were the major food items of YOY halibut. Recruitment was significantly greater in 1983 and 1984 than in 1985 (catch-per-unit-effort in 1983> 1984> 1985).

To address one aspect of this debate, a major fisheries management action, the removal of gill nets in 1994 from the nearshore arena in the Southern California Bight (34°26′30″N, 120°27′09″W to 33°32′03″N, 117°07′28″W) was analyzed. First, the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass (Atractoscion nobilis; Sciaenidae) in the early 1980s. From 1982 to 1997 catch remained at a historically low level (47.8 ± 3.0 mt) when compared to landings from 1936–1981, but increased significantly from 1995–2004 (r = 0.89, P < 0.01) to within the 95% confidence limit of the historic California landings.

Larry Allen|Bays and Estuaries|LARRY G Allen, MARY M Yoklavich, GREGOR M Cailliet, MICHAEL H Horn|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||119-148|University of California Press|Few habitats offer a more challenging environment to marine ﬁshes than bays and estuaries. These interfaces between land and sea at river mouths present highly variable physical and chemical conditions for marine ﬁshes most of which usually have narrow tolerances to these environmental gradations. Virtually all of the prominent physical and chemical characteristics of water, such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, change dramatically over space and time in these relatively shallow habitats. Tidal exchange, especially over the sometimes extensive mudﬂats and salt marshes, creates additional variability associated with strong currents, possible aerial exposure, and isolation in pools. Despite these dramatic environmental ﬂuctuations, bays and estuaries throughout the world are recognized as important ﬁsh habitats, serving especially as spawning and nursery sites, migration routes, and areas naturally supporting large populations of certain coastal ﬁsh species (eg, McHugh, 1967; Haedrich, 1983; Elliott, 2002). The complex and dynamic qualities of estuaries have fostered continuing discussion in the literature as to their deﬁnition and classiﬁcation and to their role as nursery grounds. Elliott and McLusky (2002) point out that the basic challenge of deﬁning and classifying estuaries stems from their prominence as habitats that represent spatial and temporal continua, for example, in the environmental variable of salinity and the biological variable of community structure. These authors argue for an “expert judgment checklist” that involves assessment of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics to help deﬁne, delimit, and …

Each quarter, four stations were occupied using a variety of sampling methods (large seine, small seines, square enclosure, purse seine, beam trawl, and otter trawl) designed to assess all components of the ichthyofauna. These samples yielded a total of 497,344 fishes belonging to 78 species and weighing 2,775 kg over the five-year period. Northern anchovy was the most abundant fish species comprising 43% of the total catch despite its virtual absence in 1997-98, followed by topsmelt, the slough anchovy and Pacific sardine. Round stingrays dominated in weight constituting almost 25% of the total biomass taken followed by spotted sand bass, and northern anchovy. Both numerical abundance and biomass were highest in the spring and summer months due largely to heavy recruitment of juvenile surfperches, topsmelt and northern anchovies. Large catches of northern anchovies, Pacific sardines, round stingrays, and spotted sand bass also contributed to the pronounced peaks in most July samples. Approximately 70% of all individual fish captured in San Diego Bay during this study were juveniles. The 40 most common species/recruits clustered into eleven, resident and seasonal groups. According to canonical correlation analysis, distance from the mouth of the bay, depth, temperature, and salinity accounted for nearly 88%(R2= 0.875) of the variance in species abundances. In general, the fish assemblages of San Diego Bay were found to be diverse, abundant, highly seasonal, and highly productive. The bay serves as a …

Mouth width of bays was the only significant variable accounting for variation of species numbers in stepwise multiple regression. Clustering based on presence or absence of fish species produced a southern and a northern group of bays. A two-way table (bay vs. species) distinguished three broad distributional categories of fish species.

Adults formed aggregations of three to > 200 individuals, and spawning occurred within subgroups of three to 23 individuals that contained a single female. The gonado‐somatic index (IG) of collected ripe males (mean = 5·8%, range = 0·5–13·1%) indicated a large investment in sperm production that is common in group‐spawning fishes characterized by intense sperm competition. Spawning occurred 32 min before sunset to 120 min after sunset, and both males and females were capable of spawning multiple times during a single evening. Behavioural observations of adults and estimates of spawning periodicity from the collection of females with hydrated oocytes suggested that spawning occurred continuously throughout the summer months and … 
Larry Allen|Temporal patterns of settlement in the temperate reef fish Paralabrax clathratus|Amy M Findlay, Larry G Allen|2002/8/8|Marine Ecology Progress Series|238||237-248||Variation in settlement of kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, from the pelagic to benthic environment was monitored daily during the summer 1998 on the leeward side of Santa Catalina Island, California. Settlement collectors were placed underwater on buoy lines at 5 to 7 m depth to provide a standardized form of spatial and structural refuge for settling larvae. SCUBA divers retrieved and replaced collectors each day for 58 d and totaled the number of kelp bass settlers found. Settlement of kelp bass occurred nonrandomly around the lunar cycle, suggesting a semi-lunar pattern of settlement just after the new and full moons, with peak settlement occurring approximately 5 d after the full moon. A high, positive correlation was found between settlement and tidal amplitude, and between settlement and onshore winds. A high negative correlation was found between settlement and sea surface temperature. This indicates a strong relationship between settlement of kelp bass and high amplitude tides, drops in sea surface temperature and strong onshore winds. These results suggest that internal tidal bores were a likely means of onshore transport, because bores produce near-bottom onshore flow and are prevalent during high amplitude or spring tides, but especially, they coincide with abrupt drops in sea surface temperature. Back-calculated spawn dates of successful settlers suggested a semi-lunar pattern of spawning just after the new and full moons, with peak activity occurring near the full moon. Kelp bass that settled at spring tides were significantly younger and smaller than kelp bass that settled at neap tides, thus suggesting that settlement of … 
Larry Allen|Abundance, diversity, and seasonality of cryptic fishes and their contribution to a temperate reef fish assemblage off Santa Catalina Island, California|Larry G Allen, Lucienne S Bouvier, Robert E Jensen|1992|Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences|91|2|55-69||The populations of cryptic fishes in a rock-cobble shoreline habitat within Big Fisherman's Cove, Santa Catalina Island were assessed in relation to the local conspicuous fish populations. Sampling was conducted bimonthly over a one-year period from October 1984 to October 1985. Five random, I m2 samples were taken from each of three depth strata (2.3-3.0 m, 4.2-5.1 m, and 6.4-7.6 m). Lythrypnus dalli was the most abundant fish (37% of total catch), followed by Paraclinus integripinnis (19%), Gibbonsia elegans (14%), Alloclinus holderi (12%), and Lythrypnus zebra (9%). The assemblage was markedly seasonal in terms of numerical and biomass densities with each being generally higher in warmer months. L. dalli were significantly more abundant in the deeper stratum while the density of Paraclinus integripinnis was greatest in shallower water. The numerical density of cryptic fishes was, on average, four-times that of the conspicuous fishes as measured by diver transects (283/1 00 m2 versus 71.5/100 m2). Inclusion of cryptic with conspicuous fishes increased the Shannon-Weiner Diversity (H') by an average of 41%(1.49 to 2.11) and increased the number of species by 50%(14 to 28 species). Cryptic fishes appear to make a substantial contribution to the abundance and diversity of fish assemblages inhabiting rock reef environments in southern California. The accurate censusing of reef fish populations has long been a problem for fish ecologists. Reef fishes are particularly difficult to sample because the assemblages consist of two main groups with radically different lifestyles. The first group, referred to as conspicuous fishes are generally … 
Larry Allen|Feeding mechanisms and trophic interactions|Michael H Horn, Lara A Ferry-Graham|2006/2/15|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||660|University of California Press|The composition of the present-day California marine ﬁsh fauna is largely a reﬂection of trophic interactions, as stated by Hobson (see chapter 2). The diversity and complexity of the fauna are at least in part a response to these interactions over evolutionary time scales. As such, many of the feeding behaviors and associated morphologies of ﬁshes in California waters have been shaped and honed in response to selective pressures specifically related to feeding performance. Whatever paths of evolution have resulted in this rich and varied ﬁsh fauna, the array of extant species represents much of the amazing dietary diversity seen among ocean-dwelling species in general. Fishes encounter prey that varies enormously in degree of mobility, habitat location, and in size, structure, digestibility, and nutritional content. Not surprisingly, ﬁshes including those living in the sea off California are generally opportunistic and exhibit a wide variety of ways to capture and process food to meet their energy and nutritional requirements. In this chapter, we ﬁrst organize the subject of food and feeding in ﬁshes into three parts and variously draw our examples from members of the California marine ﬁsh fauna. In the ﬁrst part, we discuss factors that determine diet including body shape and feeding behavior, identify types of food capture, and describe several kinds of feeding mechanisms.

Hom, Frank A. Edmands II, and Carol A. Usui, Bull. Southern California Acad. Sci., 82: 4 7-70, 1983. Eggs, larvae, and juvenile-adult fishes were sampled monthly over a one-year period (February 1979-January 1980) in the Cabrillo Beach area, a relatively little altered section of Los Angeles Harbor. Engraulis mordax was the most abundant species of juvenile-adult fish while sciaenid eggs and E. mordax larvae dominated the ichthyoplankton samples. Both the juvenileadult and egg and larval populations showed marked seasonal fluctuations in abundance. Quantitative clustering of juvenile-adult species in each sample produced five distinct groups ofresident and periodic species. Temperature and depth (ofcapture) accounteq for 76% of the variation in juvenile-adult abundances based on two canonical correlation axes. The Cabrillo Beach area contains a variety of habitats and supports a seasonally dynamic fish fauna characterized by a high proportion of juveniles.

Monthly cruises were made from May 1980-May 1981, at two (18-m, 30-m) depths in the region of San Onofre-Oceanside. The basic diel pattern found was of greater total numbers, total biomass, and species richness at night. Larger catches were made at night for 12 (numbers) and 9 (biomass) of the 20 most abundant species (total trawls). Average weight per fish (all species) and the length-frequency distributions of five of seven species, however, did not differ meaningfully between day and night samples.

Larry Allen|Ecology of fishes in upper Newport Bay, California: seasonal dynamics and community structure|Michael H Horn, Larry G Allen|1981|||45||California Department of Fish and Game|A total of 366 bimonthly (January 1978-January 1979) samples taken with six types of gear (otter trawl, gill net, bag seine, small seine, drop net, square enclosure - all with replication except the gill net) at four stations in upper Newport Bay, California yielded 51,816 fishes belonging to 46 species and weighing over 353 kg. Atherinops affinis (topsmelt) was the most abundant species accounting for 76% of total individuals. Seven species, all of low trophic levels, made up over 97% of the total catch. Mugil cephalus (striped mullet) ranked first in biomass (= 36% of the total) with six species accounting for more than 80% of the total biomass. The largest number of individuals (71%) was collected with the bag seine, the greatest number of species (35) was captured with the otter trawl and the largest percentage of the biomass (56%)was obtained with the gill net. Species richness, number of individuals and biomass were lowest in January (1978 or 1979) or March and highest in July (numbers, biomass) or September (species). Bimonthly diversity (H') values ranged from 0.48 to 2.17 (overall value 1.05) and tended to be inversely related to abundance levels. Species richness was greatest at Station 4 (the lowermost station) and least at Station 1 (the uppermost station). Numbers of individuals and biomass peaked at Station 2 and reached lowest levels at Station 1. Length-frequency analysis of six of the most abundant species indicated utilization of the upper bay by two or more stages in the life history of these species. More than 92,000 eggs belonging to seven taxa and an unknown category and 426 larvae from 20 taxa were collected with a 0.5 m … 
Larry Allen|Estimates of age, growth, and settlement from otoliths of young-of-the-year kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus)|Jan F Cordes, Larry G Allen|1997|BULLETIN-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|96||43-60|SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|Settled young-of-the-year (YOY) and older juvenile kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) were collected off the coast of southern California during the summers of 1989 and 1990. Daily rings on the sagittae of settled YOY kelp bass were used to determine age, estimate growth, and construct ring width profiles for each fish. Laboratory-reared larvae revealed that ring deposition began on the third day after hatching, and confirmed the daily periodicity of ring deposition. The combined 1989-90 growth curve could be described as a linear regression with the equation (length (mm))= 14.67+ 1.69 (age (days))(r=. 96), resulting in an average daily growth of 0.59 mm/day for the first 90 days of life. Backcalculated spawn dates suggested a possible lunar periodicity around the full moon. Settlement checks and otolith ring widths were used to determine the time of settlement and explore the possibility of delayed settlement in this species. The average age-at-settlement was calculated to be 30 days, with a range of 25-36 days. Only a single case of delayed settlement was evident from the incrementwidth profiles of 22 fish. The kelp bass Paralabrax clathratus is one of three congeneric species in the family Serranidae found off the coast of southern California. Traditionally a popular sport fish, local southern Californian P. clathratus populations fell off dramatically after heavy post-WWII fishing (Young 1963), but ranked second in the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) catch of 1992 (Oliphant 1993). The kelp bass is generally believed to be a long-lived, slow-growing species, and may reach an age of over thirty years and sizes up to 680 mm (Young … 
Larry Allen|Deep Rock Habitats|M Love, M Yoklavich|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||253-266|University of California Press|In this chapter, we discuss those fishes characteristically found on or over complex seafloor habitats comprising various amounts of cobble, boulders, and rock outcrops in water depths ranging from 30 to 500 m. This depth range encompasses the continental shelf and upper continental slope of California (Greene et al., 1999). We also discuss those fishes associated with such artificial structures as oil platforms off Southern California at similar depths. Because very little is known of fish assemblages associated with deep rock habitats off Baja California, we limit our discussion to California waters. See fig. 10-1 for a general depiction of bathymetry and place names of areas referenced in this chapter. Fishes that associate with complex benthic habitats below scuba depths (ie, greater than 30 m) are difficult and expensive to survey. Historically, fishing nets of various types, particularly trawl nets, have been used to make almost all assessments of deep-water fish communities. However, the rugged nature of many of these habitats renders trawl surveys less effective over low-relief structures, such as cobblestone and boulder fields, and virtually useless to assess fish assemblages accurately over high-relief rock outcrops. In addition, surveys conducted remotely from the sea surface using all types of fishing gear yield little or no information on the association among benthic habitats and fish assemblages.

In this project, 530 specimens of Gulf corvina were collected from commercial gill net fisheries in the Colorado River Delta region in Sonora, Mexico, to characterize population structure, age and growth patterns, age and size at sexual maturity and batch fecundity. Fish ranged from 145 mm to 1013 mm in total length and from 1 to 8 years of age. Von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were: L∞ = 1006 mm, k  =  0.255/yr, t0  =  0.616 years. Growth rates of Gulf corvina did not differ significantly between sexes, although females were predicted to reach a larger asymptotic length. Mean size (Lm50) and age (Am50) at sexual maturity from histological analyses of gonad tissues was 294.7 …

This mitigation effort consisted of the transplantation of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., in the western portion of the bay. In addition to the establishment of a new eelgrass bed, four enhancement reefs made of either quarry rock or concrete rubble were created to further enhance fishery stocks and the area's ecosystem. Two design criteria and a direct comparison between quarry rock and concrete reefs were examined in this 5-yr pilot program. The newly created eelgrass habitat quickly performed at the level of the existing eelgrass bed. The overall analysis found that the mitigation eelgrass habitat was not significantly different from the reference eelgrass habitat in terms of fishes. Neither reef material (quarry rock or concrete rubble) nor original reef design influenced fish utilization … 
Larry Allen|Morphologic and genetic variation among six populations of the spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatofasciatus, from southern California to the upper Sea of Cortez|Gregory J Tranah, Larry G Allen|1999|BULLETIN-SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|98||103-118|SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES|Spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatoJasciatus, were examined for 19 morphometric and 7 meristic characters to determine the extent of morphologic and genetic variation among six Pacific and Gulf of California populations. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) techniques were used to amplify and cleave the ITS region of the rONA in order to detect differences among these populations. The morphological and genetic lines of evidence demonstrate that significant differentiation has occurred between the most distant Gulf and Pacific regions. The three Baja California populations share significant morphological and genetic affinity and appear to be different from the three Pacific populations. There is no significant morphologic differentiation between the three Pacific populations although genetically they form two different groups. The northernmost Pacific population of San Diego is significantly different from the two southern-Pacific groups as well as the entire gulf sample. The results of this study indicate that geographically isolated populations of nearshore marine fishes, under the influence of strong selection pressures, do not require long periods of time for divergence. The last 15,000 years may have been sufficient to allow significant divergence to occur between upper Gulf and Pacific groups of the spotted sand bass. The spotted sand bass, Paralabrax maculatoJasciatus, is a serranid native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, having a historical range of San Francisco Bay south to Mazatlan, Mexico. Spotted sand bass rarely occur north of Santa Monica Bay (Love 1991) and are exceedingly …

To provide information critical to the management of this species, settlement patterns of white seabass within the Southern California Bight were investigated for 1988-89. Data were obtained from 16 stations sampled along the southern California coastline during June-October 1988, and at 12 stations sampled along the coasts of the mainland and four Channel Islands May-August 1989. At each station, four 5-minute tows were taken with a 1.6 m beam trawl at each of two depths, 5 and 10 m. Most young-of-the-year white seabass were < 10 mm SL and had settled within 2-3 weeks of capture. Density estimates for white seabass off southern California were low, ranging from 0.3 to only 37.8 individuals per hectare. In 1988, catch-per-unit … 
Larry Allen|The reproductive pattern of barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) from southern California|CHERYL BACA Hovey, Larry G Allen, Timothy E Hovey|2002/12/1|CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORT|||174-181|CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS|Sea basses of the genus Paralabrax are either gonochores or protogynous hermaphrodites. This study sought to determine which, if either, reproductive strategy prevails in barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer). A total of 436 specimens were collected from June 1996 through April 1997 from seven different locations along the southern California coast. Of these, only two (< 0.1%) transitional individuals were found. All males examined exhibited testes with a membrane-lined central cavity and a sperm sinus in the gonadal wall; our findings suggest that these individuals may have passed through a female-like juvenile stage prior to maturation. In addition, 52% of the males examined had atretic bodies. However, males and females were equally distributed throughout the age classes collected. Based on all evidence, we conclude that barred sand bass in southern California are functional gonochores that possess a latent, perhaps ancestral, ability to change sex.

Fish surveys on SCUBA were conducted at two reserve and two non-reserve sites from October 2002 to January 2004. Sites were similar in fish density, species richness and biomass of the entire fish assemblage. However, the adult densities of two important fishery species, California sheep-head (Semicossyphus pulcher; 7.6 ±0.5 and 5.5 ±0.4/100 m2 inside versus outside) and kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus; 3.6 ±0.4 and 2.9 ±0.4 inside versus outside), were significantly higher within the reserve. The reserve appears to be effective in increasing density and biomass of two impacted species that were readily observed and surveyed on SCUBA.

This study examined how the growth rate of juvenile white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, responded to changes in ocean temperature in an El Niño period (1997–1998) in the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, USA. Growth rates of juvenile white seabass during their first 4 years of life were estimated as the slopes of linear relationships between body mass and age (from otoliths) of 800 fish collected at 11 stations throughout the bight.

Larry Allen|The nearshore fish assemblage of Santa Catalina Island|Daniel J Pondella, Larry G Allen|2000|The proceedings of the fifth California Islands Symposium, Minerals Management Service and Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History|||394-400||The nearshore fish assemblage of Santa Catalina Island was monitored from 1996 to 1998 as part of the Ocean Resource Enhancement Hatchery Program (OREHP), California Department of Fish and Game. A stratified random design was used to sample fishes with overnight gill nets, set bimonthly from April-October. Fishes were surveyed on the East and West End of Catalina Island and in Catalina Harbor. Concomitant with this survey, seven coastal sites from Santa Barbara to Newport were surveyed as a comparison. Despite the proximity of the island to the mainland, an analysis of diversity, abundance, richness, and biomass of the nearshore fishes found Catalina Island's ichthyofauna to be functionally different from that of the mainland. This survey technique also found an increase in community importance for elasmobranchs based upon abundance and biomass; our results suggest that other sampling techniques are inadequate for estimating the importance of these large predatory and elusive fishes in nearshore communities. 
Larry Allen|Bomb radiocarbon dating and estimated longevity of Giant Sea Bass (Stereolepis gigas)|Larry G Allen, Allen H Andrews|2012/4|Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences|111|1|1-15|Southern California Academy of Sciences|In January 2010, a massive giant sea bass (500 lbs, 227 kg; near maximum reported size of 557 lbs, 253 kg) was captured off Santa Cruz Island by commercial gill-netters. This specimen presented a unique opportunity to estimate and validate of the potential longevity of the largest nearshore teleost of the northeastern Pacific. A transverse section of the sagittal otolith produced consistent counts of 62 opaque annuli along two different axes of the ventral sulcus region, translating into an estimated birth year of 1948. This age estimate was supported by measurements of radiocarbon (14C) in the other sagittal otolith core (within the first year of growth), relative to Δ14C reference records used for bomb radiocarbon dating. Two otolith core samples produced Δ14C values that were classified as pre-bomb (prior to ∼1958–59), indicating a minimum lifespan of 51 years. It is likely that giant sea bass can live more than 60 … 
Larry Allen|Surf zone, coastal pelagic zone, and harbors|Larry G Allen, DANIEL J Pondella II|2006/2/15|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters. University of California Press, Berkeley|||149-166||The nearshore zone off the Californias includes a number of other unique, primarily soft-bottom habitats. This expansive area spans the exposed, sandy beaches to the water column above the inner shelf along the entire coastline of California and south into Baja California. The fishes common to this area typically occur over the shallower portions of the shelf (see chapter 7) and the soft bottom surrounding rock reef and kelp bed environments (see chapter 8). The fish assemblages of this area tie all of the shallow water habitats closely together (Allen, 1985). In this chapter, three of the more distinctive fish assemblages within this general area will be discussed:(1) fishes of the surf zone and adjacent drift algal habitat,(2) the coastal pelagic fishes that occupy the water column above the shallow soft bottom and shelf, and (3) fishes of the numerous harbors that have been formed by breakwater construction within this general zone.

Larry Allen|Surface Waters|Larry G Allen, Jeffrey N Cross|2006|The ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters|||320-341|University of California Press|The epipelagic realm technically encompasses the upper 200 m of the ocean beyond the continental shelf, world-wide (Parin, 1968; Helfman et al., 1997). It is easily the largest habitat off California and the home of 40% of the species and 50% of the families of fishes. The water column that overlies the continental shelf comprises what we will call the coastal pelagic (neritic) realm (fig. 12-1). Because the continental shelf off most of California and Baja California is narrow, the fish assemblages of the epipelagic zone and those of the coastal pelagic realm overlap and interact on a seasonal basis (see Chapter 5). In fact, unlike most coastal areas, the highly productive waters of the major upwelling region off California are dominated by coastal pelagic species that spread into the open ocean environment well offshore (up to 300–400 km). The waters below the epipelagic zone include the Mesopelagic (approximately 200–800 m) and the bathypelagic zones (800–1000 m). These deep sea habitats are the main subjects of chapter 13 of this volume. About 200 species (70 families) have been collected in the California Current (Berry and Perkins, 1966), 79 species (30 families) have been collected in the coastal waters (Horn, 1974), and 124 species have been collected in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones (Lavenberg and Ebeling, 1967). Epipelagic fishes are relatively large, active, fast-growing, and long-lived fishes that reproduce early and repeatedly (Childress et al., 1980). Mesopelagic fishes are relatively small, slow-growing, and long-lived fishes that reproduce early and repeatedly. Bathypelagic fishes are relatively large, sluggish, rapid … 
Larry Allen|Color patterns and associated behaviors in the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus (Teleostei: Serranidae)|Brad E Erisman, Larry G Allen|2005/8|Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences|104|2|45-63|Southern California Academy of Sciences|Seasonal and ephemeral color patterns in the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, were studied on Santa Catalina Island, California from April 2000 to September 2002. Adults were monochromatic for part of the year (calico phase) and sexually dichromatic from April to October, with most adult males adopting bright orange snouts (OS phase). The seasonal occurrence of the OS phase in males overlapped with the spawning season, and the color was limited to ripe males. The OS phase in ripe males may function as a signal of sexual identity and sexual readiness to females. Both males and females exhibited distinct color patterns during courtship and spawning periods. During these periods, males were charcoal colored with dark black bars overlaying white spots (checkered phase), and females were often black with no visible spots (dark phase). Color patterns displayed by adults during spawning activities may …

Specimens ranged from 137 to 479 mm standard length and from 135 to 3,100 g. Sagittal otoliths were used to determine age. A von Bertalanffy model of growth for both populations combined was estimated as Lt = 474.4·(1 − e−0.115(t+ 2.093)), where Lt is fish length at age t. This model is comparable to those for other rock basses. The relationship between length and weight (W) followed the power function W = 0.00002·L3.0797 (r2 = 0.96) with no difference between males and females. The mortality rate was estimated as 49% per year for fish of age 5 and older. In our Bahía de los Angeles samples, the sex ratio was significantly skewed, with more males than females.

These samples were used to characterize the temporal and spatial patterns of the abundances and size and sex compositions of queenfish, Seriphus politus, in an unprotected, coastal environment. Stomach contents of sample queenfish were examined to aid our interpretation of these patterns. Adult queenfish of both sexes made diel, onshore, and offshore migrations, but immature fish generally did not. Both immatures and adults occurred in epibenthic, resting schools in shallow areas (—10 m or less depth, within—1.5 km of shore) during the day. At night, adult fish dispersed (to> 3.5 km) offshore. On average, a greater fraction of the adult males emigrated farther offshore at night than adult females. Immature fish remained inshore of 16 m …

Together, these and three other species of Seriola comprise an important component of global aquaculture production with an estimated annual value of $1.3 billion. As yellowtail aquaculture grows, the impact of unintentional releases on wild populations has become an increasingly important issue, particularly in light of international trade of hatchery seed. To create a genetic baseline, we examined spatial genetic structure in 260 specimens collected from seven locations over a wide geographical range using 15 nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial control region sequences. Overall genetic differentiation among locations, as revealed by microsatellite data, was highly significant (FST = 0.085, DEST = 0.382, P < 0.001), and pairwise estimates of divergence …

Among those species where little information on larval duration is known are the spotted (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) and barred (P. nebulifer) sand basses, two economically important species that have historically been the focus of marine recreational fisheries off southern California. PLD was determined by a count of the daily growth rings from the otolith core to the settlement check and age from the core to the otolith margin. Size at settlement was estimated by the size of the otolith from its core to the settlement mark based on the otolith size to body size relationship. Based on these significant relationships, mean size at settlement of our specimens was calculated to be 10.2 ± 1.6 mmSL for spotted sand bass and 9.1 ± 1.1 mmSL for barred sand bass …

Thirty-five species were observed or collected during the study period. The assemblage of cryptic fishes was composed primarily of a mix of Oregonian and San Diegan, species including snubnose sculpin (Orthonopias triacis), coralline sculpin (Artedius corallinus) and blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii). The species composition of conspicuous fishes was approximately equal between taxa from these two provinces. Blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), black perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) and kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) dominated the assemblage of conspicuous fishes. Species composition reflects the localized cool temperature regime of the area and the high relief kelp forest habitat.

To address questions of growth and longevity, 64 samples were obtained through collaborative efforts with commercial fish markets and scientific gillnetting. Sagittae (otoliths) were cross-sectioned and analyzed with digital microscopy. Age estimates indicate that S. gigas is a long-lived species attaining at least 76 years of age. over 90% of the variation between age (years) and standard length (mm) was accounted for in the von Bertalanffy growth model (R2= 0.911). The calculated von Bertalanffy growth function parameters (k= 0.044, t0=–0.339, l∞= 2026.2 mm Sl) for S. gigas were characteristic of a large, slow-growing, apex predator. 
Larry Allen|Ecological Classiﬁcation|LARRY G ALLEN, DANIEL J PONDELLA II|2006/2/15|The Ecology of Marine Fishes: California and Adjacent Waters|||81|Univ of California Press|The marine environment off the California coastline supports a diverse ichthyofauna consisting of northern, cold water (Oregonian) and southern, warm water (San Diegan) ﬁsh species as well as Panamic species primarily from Cortez Province (Horn and Allen, 1978). To a large extent, this high faunal diversity reﬂects the great variety of marine habitats that are available to ﬁshes within the expansive latitudinal range covered by California proper and Baja California (eg, bays and estuaries, nearshore soft bottom, shelf, slope, rocky intertidal, kelp beds, shallow and deep rocky reefs, as well as pelagic habitats)(Horn, 1980). Fortunately, the ﬁshes of these various California habitats have been the subject of numerous ichthyofaunal studies (see table 4-1) during the past 40 years. These studies allow us to ask and begin to answer one of the most fundamental questions of all,“Which ﬁshes occur where in California’s marine waters?” In the Californias, marine ﬁshes are readily quantiﬁable by various techniques and, in terms of taxonomy, are relatively well understood compared to other groups of organisms. Data from these ecological and ﬁshery surveys can be applied easily to models of numerical ecology. For these reasons, the descriptions of marine habitats and inferences about them can be made using data obtained from the study of these ﬁshes. In fact, the major biogeographical provinces in the tropical eastern Paciﬁc have been described using information from ﬁsh surveys (Hastings, 2000). More speciﬁcally, this chapter will seek to answer the following questions: 
Larry Allen|The life history and ecology of black croaker, Cheilotrema saturnum|LARRY G ALLEN, KEVIN T HERBINSON|2008/11/1||||||Results from spatial and temporal distribution analysis of 5,157 black croaker (Cheilotrema saturnum) collected by gillnet from 1995–2004 at stations from Newport to Santa Barbara, California, including Santa Catalina Island, indicated that peak catch per unit effort (CPUE) occurred along the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Annual gillnet CPUE was greatest in 2000. The highest black croaker abundance was recorded in 1997 using standardized impingement data from two Santa Monica Bay generating stations. Length-frequency analyses from both gill net and impingement sampling indicated that a large proportion of black croaker were small in size immediately prior to and during the 1997–98 El Niño Southern Oscillation, and then increased in size with time. Observed black croaker ages ranged up to 21 years old, with most fish less than 14 years old. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞= 237.7, k= 0.31, t0=–1.778, and N= 779, with no significant differences between the sexes. Gonosomatic indices peaked in June, followed by August, suggesting late-spring to summer spawning. Mortality adjusted hindcasting indicated that peak recruitment occurred in 1997.

Eight sites were surveyed on both the windward and leeward side of Santa Catalina Island every two weeks from June through August. Of the eight sites, three aggregations were identified at Goat Harbor, The V’s, and Little Harbor, CA. These three aggregation sites, the largest containing 24 individuals, contained a mean stock biomass of 19.6 kg/1000 m2 over both summers. Over the course of both summers the giant sea bass population was primarily made up of 1.2 - 1.3 m TL individuals with several small and newly mature fish …

As a consequence of this historic exploitation, populations collapsed throughout the region in the last century resulting in the listing of the species as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Recently, numbers of giant sea bass have been increasing within the region due primarily to the banning of the near shore gill net fishery in California waters in 1994. To assess population structure, the impact of historic exploitation on the genetic diversity and effective population size of the species, and to detect signs of recent population expansions, individuals from throughout the northeastern Pacific (n = 61; Northern Channel Islands, CA to San Quintín, Baja California) were sequenced at the mitochondrial control …

The development of hypotheses explaining how such a plastic (flexible) strategy has been maintained selectively has been hindered by a general lack of information on reproductive behavior in this species. Therefore, the spawning behavior of adult, wild-caught spotted sand bass were observed in captivity under a variety of densities. Three distinct spawning modes were observed: 1) pair spawning, 2) group spawning, and 3) spawning including a sneaker male. Courtship was characterized by the following sequence: 1) a male or males approach the females, 2) one or more males make contact with the ventro-lateral surface of the female and chase the female, 3) the male contacts the ventro-lateral surface of the female and pushes her through a vertical spawning rush …

Stomach contents of the salmon were more digested than those of the Pacific sandfish and may reflect differences in metabolism or time elapsed since the last meal. Mixed schooling of juvenile Pacific sandfish and pink salmon may be only an artifact of their similar size, swimming speed and feeding habits; however, both species may benefit from their association in nearshore areas. Schooling is generally believed to protect prey from predators by reducing the time a visually orienting predator has to align with an individual prey, and as size of prey schools increases, the percent of …

Larry Allen|Year-class strength predicts commercial catch 11 years later for white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, off southern California|Dwin Leung, Larry G Allen|2016/9/1|California Fish and Game|102|4|175-182||Fisheries in the past have undergone collapse due to over-exploitation of a target species beyond natural replenishment. White seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) has been a commercial fishery species in Southern California since the late 1800s and a popular recreational species since the mid-20th century (Hervas et al. 2010). A decline in their numbers was seen in the early 1900s and by 1982 caused the commercial white seabass fishery to move operations offshore and abide by management regulations. The change in white seabass recreational catch was dramatic and attributed to overfishing, declining from a peak of 64,000 individuals in 1949 to 284 in 1978 (Vojkovich and Reed 1983, Vojkovich & Crooke 2001). Over the last two decades, the population of white seabass along the coast of California appears to be rising. The Marine Resource Protection Act in 1994 imposed restrictions by limiting fishing depth along the California coast and Channel Islands in addition to the state wide ban in the use of gill and trammel nets, resulting in a significant increase in white seabass numbers between 1995-2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008). White seabass commercial take was low in 1997 with 26 t and in 1998 greatly increased to 70 t (California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations [CalCOFI] 1999). Recent reports indicate that the combined commercial and recreational catch during 2008 was 342 t (CalCOFI 2009), and increased slightly to 364 t in 2010 (CalCOFI 2011). Year-class strength is an index that uses measures of abundance, survivorship, or recruitment rates to summarize the success of a species for a given year (Landsman et al. 2011 …

Subsamples of mature oocytes from preserved ovaries were counted by eye to determine batch fecundity, which was best correlated to fish mass (R2= 0.40, df= 21, P= 0.001). Batch fecundity, as a function of mass, did not differ significantly from previously reported values (ANCOVA, F= 0.535, df= 1, 31, P= 0.470). For the first time, barracuda were aged using sectioned sagittal otoliths and data were fit to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Age classes 0-XVIII were represented and the growth rate was fast during the first year for both sexes. Females were significantly longer than males at every age class (ANCOVA, F= 3.934, df= 1, 402, P= 0.048). A subset of fish was also aged using scale analysis to facilitate comparison to previous studies. Scales were deemed unreliable as aging structures for fish older than 4 years, however, otolith-determined ages were not significantly different from scale ages for age classes 0 to IV (ANCOVA, F= 0.105, df= 1, 75, P= 0.746). The current study collected more young-of-the-year S. argentea than historical studies. Additionally, otolith analysis provided greater age class resolution … 
Larry Allen|Captive Breeding of Spotted Sand Bass, Paralabrax maculatofasciatus, in Southern California|Eric F Miller, Larry G Allen|2006/3/1|CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME|92|2|98|CALIFORNIA DEPT. OF FISH & GAME|Spotted sand bass, Para/abrax maculatofasciatus, ranges from Mazatlan, Mexico to Monterey, California including lhe Gulf of California, in depths out to 60 m (Miller and Lea 1972, Thomson et al. 2000). In southern California, spotted sand bass commonly inhabit shallow waan waters in embayments and harbors above bottom structure, predominantly eelgrass beds (Limbaugh 19551, Alleo 1985, AlleoetaJ. 1995, Hovey and Allen 2000). Unlike other members of the genus common to southern California (kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, and barred sand bass, P. nebulifer), spotted sand bass adults are generally restricted to coastal embaymeots, with little or no migration along lhe open coast as adults (LG Allen. personal observation). lt has been hypothesized that southern California populations are maintained only through the dispersal of planktonic larvae along the open coast, which can lead to years of depressed recruitment when oceanic conditions are not suitable to spotted sand bass larval development, ie sea surface temperatures in excess of20C {Allen etaL 1995). Throughout their range, spotted sand bass exhibit high growth rates and early sexual maturity {< I year of age; Allen et al. 1995). However, they areshon-lived, with most individuals dying well before their I 0111 year in the Sou them California Bight {Allen et al. 1995). A small, but increasing, recreational fishery for spotted sand bass exists in southern California, wilh landings ranging from 12,000 to over 500,000 individuals annuallyfrom I 976-1999 (Hovey and Allen200 I). The increased recreational fishing pressure and accompanying variability in spotted sand bass landings …

Larry Allen|Baby Giants are found at the heads of submarine canyons|Larry G Allen, Stephanie A Benseman, Michael Couffer|2019/1|Ecology|100|1|e02496||One of the age-old mysteries surrounding the Giant Sea Bass (Stereolepis gigas) has been “where are the baby giants?” For almost a century, we have known that their young-ofthe-year (= YOY or baby) do not look anything like the adults (Figure 1). However, where the YOY recruits could be found remained largely unknown until now. That mystery has now been solved courtesy of our three-year study on the distribution and ecology of their young-ofthe-year (YOY) off southern California. The main goal of that study was to determine the distribution and general ecology of the YOY of this rare, elusive, and endangered species

Body posture, vocalizations or the incorporation of bright coloration are typically used to establish dominance (Wiley 1973, Warner 1975, Clarke and Faulkes 1997, Peterson and Jacobs 2002) alert conspecifics of nearby threats or foraging opportunities (Godin and Morgan 1985, Beauchamp and Heeb 2001, Le Roux et al. 2009, Townsend et al. 2011) and for breeding purposes (Wiley 1973, Hagen et al. 1980, Christy 1983, Gibson 1989, DeMartini and Sikkel 2006). In many species females select a male based on their behavioral display of some desirable trait or their ability to express dominance or competitive superiority over other potential mates (DeMartini and Sikkel 2006). Such criteria are often not mutually exclusive in that particular features or actions may act to deter … 
Larry Allen|The genetic diversity and population structure of barred sand bass, Paralabrax nebulifer|Corinne Nichole Paterson|2014||||||Fishery management relies on aspects of the life history of a fished species to implement effective management strategies. One aspect that has been underutilized is molecular markers. The addition of these methods can lead to a better understanding of a fishery stock and thus better management strategies. This study looks at barred sand bass (commonly, sand bass), Paralabrax nebulifer, a commonly fished species in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Sand bass form large spawning aggregations in the summer months of June-August, which makes them highly susceptible to overfishing. In the last decade, populations of sand bass in southern California have experienced a severe decline in numbers and subsequently the recreational fishery has been seriously impacted. Large population declines, such as a fishery decline, can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and potentially a genetic bottleneck. This is a concern for barred sand bass populations; however, the population structure and genetic diversity of barred sand bass populations was previously unknown. This study looks at both aspects using the d-loop region of the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers for populations throughout California and Mexico. Samples of barred sand bass were collected between 1997 and 1999 and from 2010 to 2013. DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR for the mitochondrial DNA control region and for microsatellite primers developed for barred sand bass. Microsatellite primers were designed and tested for this study. Both markers show a high degree of genetic diversity indicating one large, panmictic population …

This study provides information on length-weight relationships, age, and growth of these two ecologically important species. Opaleye and halfmoon were collected from throughout the Southern California Bight to evaluate these life history characteristics. Length-weight relationships were described by the equations W5 0.00002 L3. 081 for opaleye and W5 0.000003 L3. 454 for halfmoon. Sagittal otoliths were used to age opaleye from ages 3–10 and halfmoon from ages 0–8. In addition, age classes 0-II for opaleye were determined from length frequency analysis of preserved specimens. Von Bertalanffy growth curves were fitted to mean standard length (mm) at age for each species. Opaleye were aged … 
Chhandak Basu|Plant terpenoids: applications and future potentials|Sam Zwenger, Chhandak Basu|2008|Biotechnology and Molecular Biology Reviews|3|1|1|Academic Journals|The importance of terpenes in both nature and human application is difficult to overstate. Basic knowledge of terpene and isoprene biosynthesis and chemistry has accelerated the pace at which scientists have come to understand many plant biochemical and metabolic processes. The abundance and diversity of terpene compounds in nature can have ecosystem-wide influences. Although terpenes have permeated human civilization since the Egyptians, terpene synthesis pathways are only now being understood in great detail. The use of bioinformatics and molecular databases has largely contributed to analyzing exactly how and when terpenes are synthesized. Additionally, terpene synthesis is beginning to be understood in respect to the various stages of plant development. Much of this knowledge has been contributed by the plant model, Arabidopsis thaliana. Considering the advances in plant terpene knowledge and potential uses, it is conceivable that they may soon be used in agrobiotechnology.

Gas-phase chemical reactions initiate the removal of these compounds from the atmosphere, which ultimately proceeds via deposition at the surface or direct oxidation to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. We performed ecosystem-scale flux measurements that show that the removal of oxygenated VOC via dry deposition is substantially larger than is currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up-regulation of various stress-related genes, leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding. A revised scheme for the uptake of oxygenated VOCs, incorporated into a global chemistry-transport model, predicts appreciable regional changes in annual dry …

Chhandak Basu|Weed genomics: new tools to understand weed biology|Chhandak Basu, Matthew D Halfhill, Thomas C Mueller, C Neal Stewart Jr|2004/8/1||9|8|391-398|Elsevier Current Trends|In spite of the large yield losses that weeds inflict on crops, we know little about the genomics of economically important weed species. Comparative genomics between plant model species and weeds, map-based approaches, genomic sequencing and functional genomics can play vital roles in understanding and dissecting weedy traits of agronomically important weed species that damage crops. Weed genomics research should increase our understanding of the evolution of herbicide resistance and of the basic genetics underlying traits that make weeds a successful group of plants. Here, we propose specific weed candidates as genomic models, including economically important plants that have evolved herbicide resistance on several occasions and weeds with good comparative genomic qualities that can be anchored to the genomics of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa. 
Chhandak Basu|The production of the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene in a transgenic strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis|Robert E Reinsvold, Robert E Jinkerson, Randor Radakovits, Matthew C Posewitz, Chhandak Basu|2011/5/15|Journal of plant physiology|168|8|848-852|Urban & Fischer|The plant secondary metabolite, β-caryophyllene, is a ubiquitous component of many plant resins that has traditionally been used in the cosmetics industry to provide a woody, spicy aroma to cosmetics and perfumes. Clinical studies have shown it to be potentially effective as an antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory agent. Additionally, there is significant interest in engineering phototrophic microorganisms with sesquiterpene synthase genes for the production of biofuels. Currently, the isolation of β-caryophyllene relies on purification methods from oleoresins extracted from large amounts of plant material. An engineered cyanobacterium platform that produces β-caryophyllene may provide a more sustainable and controllable means of production. To this end, the β-caryophyllene synthase gene (QHS1) from Artemisia annua was stably inserted, via double homologous recombination, into the genome of the … 
Chhandak Basu|Leaf proteome analysis reveals prospective drought and heat stress response mechanisms in soybean|Aayudh Das, Moustafa Eldakak, Bimal Paudel, Dea-Wook Kim, Homa Hemmati, Chhandak Basu, Jai S Rohila|2016|BioMed research international|2016|||Hindawi|Drought and heat are among the major abiotic stresses that affect soybean crops worldwide. During the current investigation, the effect of drought, heat, and drought plus heat stresses was compared in the leaves of two soybean varieties, Surge and Davison, combining 2D-DIGE proteomic data with physiology and biochemical analyses. We demonstrated how 25 differentially expressed photosynthesis-related proteins affect RuBisCO regulation, electron transport, Calvin cycle, and carbon fixation during drought and heat stress. We also observed higher abundance of heat stress-induced EF-Tu protein in Surge. It is possible that EF-Tu might have activated heat tolerance mechanisms in the soybean. Higher level expressions of heat shock-related protein seem to be regulating the heat tolerance mechanisms. This study identifies the differential expression of various abiotic stress-responsive proteins that regulate various molecular processes and signaling cascades. One inevitable outcome from the biochemical and proteomics assays of this study is that increase of ROS levels during drought stress does not show significant changes at the phenotypic level in Davison and this seems to be due to a higher amount of carbonic anhydrase accumulation in the cell which aids the cell to become more resistant to cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2. 
Chhandak Basu|Use of β-glucuronidase reporter gene for gene expression analysis in turfgrasses|Chhandak Basu, Albert P Kausch, Joel M Chandlee|2004/7/16|Biochemical and biophysical research communications|320|1|7-10|Academic Press|The β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene has been successfully used as a reporter gene in innumerable number of plant species. The functional GUS gene produces blue coloration in plants upon integration into the plant genome. Because of the ease it provides to analyze the gene expression (as no expensive equipment is needed), GUS gene is surely plant biotechnologist’s first choice as a reporter gene. The turfgrass family contains the world’s most economically important horticultural crops. There is a world-wide drive for genetic modification of grasses due to its huge economic importance. GUS gene can be transiently or stably expressed in grasses for the purpose of promoter analysis and to study tissue-specific and developmental gene expression. This paper summarizes the use of GUS gene for transient and stable expression studies in various turfgrass species.

Penn A4) following microprojectile bombardment. The constructs analyzed consisted of the uidA (GUS) reporter gene driven by four different promoters (ubiquitin 3-potato, ubiquitin corn, ubiquitin rice and CaMV 35S). The total number of GUS hits (or transient expression units; TEUs) were determined manually under a dissecting scope after histochemical staining for GUS. Results suggest that the ubiquitin rice promoter is most active in cells of turfgrass, regardless of the developmental stage or tissue-type. The ubiquitin corn promoter was the next best. Of the four promoter used, except for ubiquitin 3-potato, reporter gene activity was dramatically higher in mature leaves compared to young leaves. The relative …

In order to generate a marker to select between hybrids of glyphosate resistant (GR) and glyphosate susceptible (GS) horseweed, a GR horseweed accession from western Tennessee was transformed with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene. The GFP marker allowed for the simple and accurate determination of GR hybrid plants by visual observation. GR plants were shown to be transgenic via the green fluorescence under UV light, and resistant to glyphosate when sprayed with the field-use-rate 0.84 kg acid equivalent ha−1 of glyphosate (i.e. RoundupTM) herbicide. An in vitro screen for glyphosate resistance in seedlings was developed, and a 5 μM glyphosate concentration was found to reduce dry weight in GS seedlings but not in GR seedlings. The GR plants containing GFP … 
Chhandak Basu|Comparative analyses of plant transcription factor databases|Silvia R Ramirez, Chhandak Basu|2009/3/1|Current genomics|10|1|10-17|Bentham Science Publishers|Transcription factors (TFs) are proteinaceous complex, which bind to the promoter regions in the DNA and affect transcription initiation. Plant TFs control gene expressions and genes control many physiological processes, which in turn trigger cascades of biochemical reactions in plant cells. The databases available for plant TFs are somewhat abundant but all convey different information and in different formats. Some of the publicly available plant TF databases may be narrow, while others are broad in scopes. For example, some of the best TF databases are ones that are very specific with just one plant species, but there are also other databases that contain a total of up to 20 different plant species. In this review plant TF databases ranging from a single species to many will be assessed and described. The comparative analyses of all the databases and their advantages and disadvantages are also discussed.

The disease causes severe injury to putting greens and can kill large stands of turfgrass. For some time, however, both the bacterial origin of the disease and the causal agent were in doubt. In order to investigate the identity of the causal agent, isolation of the pathogen was undertaken and pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's postulates on P. annua. Additional pathogenicity trials then were undertaken to determine the host range of the causal bacterium. Ability of the bacterium to cause disease was restricted to P. annua var. annua and P. attenuata. However, the bacterium was able to survive asymptomatically in vascular systems of P. annua var. reptans and P. trivialis. Experiments to determine the optimal growth temperature of the organism demonstrated that the bacterial growth …

Terpenoids play a large role in plant development and stress response. The terpene synthase family comprises a diverse set of genes, all which contribute to production of terpenoids. We have used tools of bioinformatics and performed an in silico analysis of developmental and tissue specific terpene synthase gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as those expressed due to biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli. Using software tools from Genevestigator, a powerful microarray analyzer, we used multiple tool sets to better understand terpene synthase expression in Arabidopsis, which will hopefully open the genetic door to further wet laboratory investigations. The data can be used to predict roles of terpene synthase genes in plant cell division and growth. The data presented here can be used to model for terpene synthesis expression in …

The exact mechanism of stress tolerance during cryopreservation is unknown. Unavavailability of a detailed protocol for understanding the moelcular genetics of plant cryostress is a major obstacle in plant cryobiology research. This paper describes the methods of extraction of total RNA from cryogenically stored plant tissues accompanied by successful amplication of cDNAs by reverse transcriptase PCR. The whole process can be completed in two to three days. Through this protocol, several genes were indentified which were differentially expressed during cryostress. This protocol will help researchers to pursue further research in the field of molecular genetics of plant cryostress. Interesting genes identified via these processes can be cloned and plants can be transfomred for the purpose of trait enhancement and modification.

Chhandak Basu|Molecular physiology of heat stress responses in plants|Homa Hemmati, Dinesh Gupta, Chhandak Basu|2015||||109-142|Springer, New York, NY|Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that plants encounter. Heat stress causes billions of dollars in losses of agricultural crops worldwide. Here, we summarize the molecular and whole genome responses due to heat stress in plants. It has been reported that there are cascades of biochemical reactions that lead to heat stress. In most cases, heat stress is coupled with drought stress response. With the advancements in genomic tools, we have more information on genes, which are up- or down-regulated in plants due to heat stress. The heat-stressed plants may exhibit various physiological responses, including stomatal closure, suppressed photosynthesis, stunted growth, etc. Microarray and transcriptome sequencing gave us the tools to perform genome-wide expression profiling in heat-stressed plants. Understanding how gene expression in heat-stressed plants works will help us to discover …

MBO has a high energy content making it superior to ethanol in terms of energy output, and due to its volatility and lower solubility in water, MBO is easier to recover than ethanol. Pine’s MBO synthase enzyme utilizes the intermediate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) produced by the methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate isoprenoid pathway for the production of MBO. In this study, we performed metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli to express an alternate mevalonate dependent pathway for production of DMAPP, along with a codon optimized Pinus sabiniana MBO synthase gene. This heterologous expressed pathway carried out the conversion of an acetyl CoA precursor to DMAPP leading to production of MBO.

Considering climate change, the goal of this study was to investigate differential expression of proteins and lipids produced by this tree under heat stress conditions. Total lipid was extracted from heat stressed plant leaves and various sesquiterpenes produced by the tree under heat stress were identified. Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis were used to study lipid and volatile compounds produced by the plant. Several volatiles, isoprene, 2-methyl butanenitrile, β ocimene and a numbers of sesquiterpenes differentially produced by the plant under heat stress were identified. We propose these compounds were produced by the tree to cope up with heat stress. A protein gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) was performed to study differential expression of proteins in heat stressed plants … 
Chhandak Basu|An introduction to molecular genetic and genomic techniques|Chhandak Basu, Sam R Zwenger|2009/8/7|Weedy and Invasive Plant Genomics. Wiley-Blackwell, USA|||11-24||This chapter offers a list of molecular tools that should be useful to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis of weediness. A large majority of agriculturists and botanists alike seek to understand weediness traits on a molecular level, and perhaps, in some cases, even use the information to help control weeds in agriculture. Before one attempts to defeat an enemy, one should learn its characteristic strengths and weaknesses and use them advantageously. Toward that end, we list various molecular markers and tools such as map-based cloning and functional genomics that should help in determining these characteristics. 
Chhandak Basu|Transient reporter gene (GUS) expression in creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris) is affected by in vivo nucleolytic activity|Chhandak Basu, Hong Luo, Albert P Kausch, Joel M Chandlee|2003/6/1|Biotechnology letters|25|12|939-944|Kluwer Academic Publishers|Leaf and callus tissues of a creeping bentgrass cultivar (Penn A4) had high nuclease activities that degraded exogenously added plasmid DNA. When callus tissue was incubated for 24 h with heparin, spermidine, aurintricarboxylic acid or polyethylene glycol, only heparin and spermidine were effective as in vitro nuclease inhibitors, protecting exogenously added plasmid DNA from degradation. When β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene activity was evaluated in heparin-treated (0.6%), 14-month old callus following microprojectile bombardment, GUS activity increased 1000-fold compared to equivalent aged untreated Penn A4 callus. Similar enhancement from heparin pretreatment (0.6% or 1.2%) was not observed in 6-month old callus. This is likely due to much higher activities of nuclease in the younger callus. 
Chhandak Basu|Does an expressed sequence tag (EST) library of Salsola iberica (tumbleweed) help to understand plant responses to environmental stresses?|Sam R Zwenger, Rotana Alsaggaf, Chhandak Basu|2010/11/1|Plant signaling & behavior|5|11|1330-1335|Taylor & Francis|Weeds play an important role in agriculture and molecular techniques are useful to help understand traits that contribute to weediness and weeds’ interactions with the environment. A total of 377 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a modest library were arranged into 227 unique fragments and 61 contigs, which consisted of two or more ESTs. From blastx results, we mapped and annotated unigenes using the gene ontology vocabulary according to biological process, cellular component and molecular function. These were then compared to a reference set of Arabidopsis thaliana sequences for statistically significant over- or underrepresented genes. The sequences were also compared against multiple protein databases for similarity of functional domains. Overall, the S. iberica sequences showed high similarity to response to stress, which included salt-induced proteins, betaine aldehydehyde dehydrogenase … 
Chhandak Basu|Revisiting the dry depositional sink of oxidized organic vapors to vegetation|Thomas Karl, Peter Harley, Luisa Emmons, Brenda Thornton, Alex Guenther, Chhandak Basu, Andrew Turnipseed, Kolby Jardine|2010/5|Geophys Res Abstr|12||||Large quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOC) enter the atmosphere. The annual production of VOC (600-2000 TgC/a) likely exceeds that of methane and CO (~ 500 TgC/a each). Together these gases fuel tropospheric chemistry. Oxidation of VOC leads to the formation of aerosol (Hallquist et al., 2009) via complex organic chemistry (eg Atkinson and Arey, 2003; Paulot et al., 2009) in the gas and aerosol phase thereby modulating the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere (Lelieveld et al., 2008). Currently one of the biggest uncertainties in constraining budgets of VOC is the amount of dry and wet deposition to vegetation, which acts as a major source and sink for organic trace gases on a global scale. This has consequences for constraining secondary species produced in the gasphase, which will either oxidize to CO and CO2, condense on or form organic aerosol (OA) and be rained out, or directly deposit to the surface via dry and wet deposition. Two recent bottom-up assessments of the tropospheric OA budget (Hallquist et al., 2009, Goldstein and Galbally, 2007) were based on varying assumptions for wet and dry deposition of organic vapors (eg 130-200 TgC/a vs 800 TgC/a) and consequently derived significantly different global production rates for secondary organic aerosol (SOA). We present a synthesis of ecosystem scale flux measurements showing that the removal of oxygenated VOC (OVOC) via dry deposition is significantly larger than currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate that exposure to ozone, MVK or mechanical wounding can enhance the uptake of OVOCs. Since the general route …

In our study we evaluated the functional potential of the enzyme involved in ethylene biosynthesis of plants called ACC (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase which converts precursor ACC to ethylene. Studies on ethylene have proven that it is effective in improving the flood tolerance in plants. Thus our goal was to understand the potential of ACC oxidase gene overexpression in providing flood tolerance in transgenic plants. ACC oxidase gene was PCR amplified and inserted into the pBINmgfp5-er vector, under the control of a constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus promoter. GV101 strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing recombinant pBINmgfp5-er vector (referred herein as pBIN-ACC) was used for plant transformation by the ‘floral dip’ method.

Chhandak Basu|An overview of advances in plant genomics in the new millennium|Robert J Henry|2016/4/19||||37-59|CRC Press|The technologies available for genomics have continued to develop rapidly since 2000, accelerating their application in plant biology and plant breeding. These technologies are providing the tools to allow costeffective collection of much larger volumes of data on plant genomes. This, in turn, requires the development of bioinformatics capabilities to analyze these data and apply them successfully in plant improvement. Genomics, in a general sense, is advancing by improvements in technology at each of the levels from studies of DNA (genomics) and RNA (transcriptomics), which are often considered a core part of genomics, to proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics) and the phenotypes (phenomics)(Table 1). 
Chhandak Basu|Transcriptional analyses of an ethanol inducible promoter in Escherichia coli and tobacco for production of cellulase and green fluorescent protein|Homa Hemmati, Chhandak Basu|2015/11/2|Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment|29|6|1043-1052|Taylor & Francis|Cellulase is a widely used enzyme for saccharification of plant cell walls for the production of biofuels. In our work, we tested an ethanol inducible native alcA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and tobacco. The alcA promoter was fused with a cellulase gene and then the promoter was compared with other widely used promoters, namely, T5 and cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S in E. coli. We also tested the activity of alcA promoter in tobacco by transiently expressing a green fluorescent protein gene under the control of alcA promoter. We concluded from our quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results that when alcA promoter was expressed along with AlcR transcription factor, the alcA promoter was 11 times more active than the T5 promoter. The qPCR data suggested that there may be a direct correlation between AlcR concentrations and alcA activity, indicating a key …

We found over production of phytol in Nostoc punctiforme by expressing a 2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) synthase gene. MBO synthase catalyzes the conversion of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) into MBO, a volatile hemiterpene alcohol, in Pinus sabiniana. The result of enhanced phytol production in N. punctiforme, instead of MBO, could be explained by one of the 2 models: either the presence of a native prenyltransferase enzyme with a broad substrate specificity, or appropriation of a MBO synthase metabolic intermediate by a native geranyl diphosphate (GDP) synthase. In this work, an expression vector with an indigenous petE promoter for gene expression in the cyanobacterium N. punctiforme was constructed and MBO synthase gene expression was successfully shown using reverse transcriptase (RT … 
Chhandak Basu|Extraction of RNA from Recalcitrant Tree Species Paulownia elongata|Niveditha Ramadoss, Chhandak Basu|2018/7/20|Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|||||Isolation of pure RNA is the basic requisite for most molecular biology work. Plants contain polyphenols and polysaccharides, which can interfere with isolation of pure RNA from them. Especially hardwood tree species like Paulownia elongata have surplus amount of RNA-binding alkaloids, proteins and secondary metabolites that can further complicate the process of RNA extraction. Paulownia elongata is a fast-growing tree species which is known for its role in environmental adaptability and biofuel research. Here we describe an economical, efficient and time-saving method (2 h) to extract RNA from leaf tissues of the tree Paulownia elongata. Lack of DNA contamination and good RNA integrity were confirmed using RNA Gel electrophoresis. The purity of RNA was confirmed using Nanodrop spectrophotometer that revealed an A 260: A 280 ratio of about 2.0. The purified RNA was successfully used in the downstream applications such as RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription PCR) and qPCR (quantitative PCR). This method could be used for RNA extraction from several other recalcitrant tree species.

Chhandak Basu|Transcriptional Profiling|Sam R Zwenger, Chhandak Basu|2016/4/19||||460-482|CRC Press|Within the last decade, there has been rapid advancement in expression profiling of all organisms, including plants. The study of transcripts, primarily those of mRNA origin, has become one of many ‘omics’ characters to appear on the stage of molecular biology. Transcriptomics, the specific discipline, which aims to characterize organisms’ transcripts, is heavily involved in understanding the patterns of gene expression. These patterns are variable under certain environmental conditions, for example, during different life stages, or within a particular tissue. Research has come to show that although housekeeping genes may be constitutively expressed, other genes are not necessarily expressed all of the time (eg, stress-response genes). While one might only focus on an organism’s mRNA transcripts, other factors (promoters, cis-and transacting elements, transcription factors, enhancers, siRNA etc.) are necessarily …

The advancements in molecular tools such as expressed sequence tag (EST) library construction provide a novel opportunity for insight into the physiology of this tree. We generated a small set of ESTs for a young copaiba, sequencing and annotating a total of 613 unigenes. Of these, 84% showed similarity to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Annotation showed 70% of unigenes had at least one associated Gene Ontology (GO) term. We found a majority of ESTs to be associated with heat response genes. Based on these data, this EST library of C. officinalis represents a small but important step in helping to understand the general physiology and heat-response expression patterns. Additionally, this small collection of EST offers a modest starting point in helping to understand this enigmatic tropical plant.

Heat stress and insect wounding have been associated with an increase in the release of stored and de novo synthesized BVOCs. These BVOCs are released into the atmosphere, where they can interact with nitrous oxides to create ozone and alter cloud properties via the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). To determine the source of the BVOCs being released (stored vs. de novo), we subjected both species (Ponderosa and Hymenaea) to heat stress and methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment. The temperature in the growth chamber containing the trees was increased from 24 C to 40 C (Ponderosa) or 27 C to 42 C (Hymenaea), and BVOCs were collected using leaf …

Chhandak Basu|Gene flow and introgression from transgenic crops to weeds|Chhandak Basu, Matthew D Halfhill, Thomas C Mueller, C Neal Stewart|2004|Trends in Plant Science|8|9|391-398||In spite of the large yield losses that weeds inflict on crops, we know little about the genomics of economically important weed species. Comparative genomics between plant model species and weeds, map-based approaches, genomic sequencing and functional genomics can play vital roles in understanding and dissecting weedy traits of agronomically important weed species that damage crops. Weed genomics research should increase our understanding of the evolution of herbicide resistance and of the basic genetics underlying traits that make weeds a successful group of plants. Here, we propose specific weed candidates as genomic models, including economically important plants that have evolved herbicide resistance on several occasions and weeds with good comparative genomic qualities that can be anchored to the genomics of Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa.

This is likely due to superior ability of turfgrasses to absorb nitrate. No direct evidence for this theory has been reported. The present study quantified nitrate leaching under miniature turf and nitrate uptake by individual turfgrass plants, and established the relationship between nitrate leaching loss and nitrate uptake rate. Seedlings of six Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars, `Blacksburg', `Barzan', `Connie', `Dawn', `Eclipse', and `Gnome', were planted individually in polystyrene containers filled with silica sand. The plants were irrigated with tap water or a nutrient solution containing 1 mm nitrate on alternate days and mowed to a 5-cm height once each week for 25 weeks. Nitrate leaching potential was then determined by applying 15 to 52 mL of nutrient solutions containing 7 to 70 mg·L-1 nitrate-N into the containers and … 
Chhandak Basu|Characterization of Nitrate Uptake by Kentucky Bluegrass at the Whole-plant and Organ Levels|Yuexia Wang, Chhandak Basu, Zhongchun Jiang, W Michael Sullivan|2000/8/1|HortScience|35|5|829D-829|American Society for Horticultural Science|It has been suggested that shoot demand for nitrogen controls nitrate uptake in plant roots. In turfgrasses, shoots are partly removed by regular mowing, which may severely alter nitrate uptake ability. However, reported groundwater nitrate concentrations under intensively managed turf are well below the USEPA maximum contaminant limit of 10 mg·L-1 nitrate-N in potable water. We hypothesize that the turfgrass root can also exert significant control over its nitrate uptake ability. The present study was to test this hypothesis by comparing nitrate uptake rates of excised roots and intact, whole plants of six Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars. Three replications or cultures of each cultivar were grown in sand for 15 months. For whole-plant nitrate uptake, the roots were placed in a flask filled with 200 mL of a nutrient solution containing 0.125 mm nitrate. Nitrate depletion was monitored at 20-minute intervals …

The culture was done in glucose broth and, at the end of a week, a yellowish membranous growth was detected at the bottom. A small piece of-this growth was washed in saline and was planted on agar and incubated for 4 days, Two types of colonies were seen. One was a yellowish slimy colony and the other an orange coloured colony. The slimy colonies consisted of Gram-negative bacillary organisms, which on further incubation showed filamentous forms, while the orange coloured colonies showed a Gram-positive diph-theroid organism which is still being studied. In the present article a brief description of the filamentous organism is given.: 
Chhandak Basu|Measuring the dry depositional sink of oxidized organic vapors to vegetation using PTRMS|Thomas Karl, Peter Harley, Luisa Emmons, Brenda Thornton, Chhandak Basu, Alex Guenther, Andrew Turnipseed, Kolby Jardine|||||||In recent years PTR-MS technology has played a significant role for quantitative analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in environmental sciences. Due to its rapid sample analysis capability PTRMS has been particularly useful in combination with micrometeorological measurement strategies. Analysis of oxygenated VOC (oVOCs) fluxes from past measurement campaigns reveals a significant uncertainty in the dry depositional flux of oVOCs Large quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOC) enter the atmosphere. The annual production of VOC (600-2000 TgC/a) likely exceeds that of methane and CO (~ 500 TgC/a each). Together these gases fuel tropospheric chemistry. Oxidation of VOC leads to the formation of aerosol (Hallquist et al., 2009) via complex organic chemistry (eg Atkinson and Arey, 2003; Paulot et al., 2009) in the gas and aerosol phase thereby modulating the oxidation capacity of the … 
Chhandak Basu|Optimization of Parameters for Delivery of Transgenes to Turfgrass Cells|Chhandak Basu, Albert P Kausch, Joel M Chandlee|||||||Parameters for use of the PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad, USA) particle delivery system were optimized for routine delivery of transgenes into turfgrass cells in an attempt to standardize methods for routine and efficient genetic transformation of turfgrass species (creeping bentgrass, cv. Penn A4). Among various callus types produced on callus induction medium, embryogenic callus was identified using electron microscopy. Suspension cultures of Penn A4 were bombarded using a ubiquitin rice promoter-GUS gene construct. Based on the number of ‘GUS hits’, the following conditions were determined to be optimal for transfer of foreign gene constructs into turfgrass cells: 1.0 μm gold, 7 μl DNA/shot and 1100 psi rupture disc type. Transient GUS expression patterns in turfgrass suspension culture cells driven with three different promoters (PGEL1, ubiquitin rice-GUS and ubiquitin corn-GUS) were also evaluated. The … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-targeted Salmonella as a novel anticancer vector|John M Pawelek, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|1997/10/15|Cancer research|57|20|4537-4544|American Association for Cancer Research|There has been little investigation of bacteria as gene delivery vectors. Here, we demonstrate that genetically engineered Salmonella have many of the desirable properties of a delivery vector, including targeting of multiple tumors from a distant inoculation site, selective replication within tumors, tumor retardation, and the ability to express effector genes, such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV TK). When wild-type Salmonella were introduced into melanoma-bearing mice, the bacteria were found within the tumor at levels exceeding 109 per g, although as pathogens, they caused the death of the mice. However, when attenuated, hyperinvasive auxotrophic mutants were used, the tumor-targeting and amplification phenomena were retained, whereas their pathogenicity was limited. With such attenuated strains, the tumor:liver ratios ranged between 250:1 and 9000:1. When these auxotrophs were …

Genetic modifications of tumor-targeting Salmonella that alter lipid A and increase safety must, however, retain the useful properties of this bacteria. We report here that disruption of the Salmonella msbB gene reduces TNFα induction and increases the LD 50 of this pathogenic bacteria by 10,000-fold. Notwithstanding this enormous difference, Salmonella retains its tumor-targeting properties, exhibiting tumor accumulation ratios in excess of 1000: 1 compared with normal tissues. Administration of this bacteria to mice bearing melanoma results in tumors that are less than 6% the size of tumors in untreated controls at day 18. Thus, the antitumor activity previously demonstrated using … 
David Bermudes|Bacteria as tumour-targeting vectors|John M Pawelek, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2003/9/1||4|9|548-556|Elsevier|Live bacteria were first actively used in the treatment of cancer nearly 150 years ago, work that ultimately led to the study of immunomodulation. Today, with the discovery of bacterial strains that specifically target tumours, and aided by genomic sequencing and genetic engineering, there is new interest in the use of bacteria as tumour vectors. Bifodobacterium, Clostridium, and Salmonella have all been shown to preferentially replicate within solid tumours when injected from a distal site, and all three types of bacteria have been used to transport and amplify genes encoding factors such as prodrug-converting enzymes, toxins, angiogenesis inhibitors, and cytokines. In this review we provide a historical discussion of this area, and describe the development of the bacteria, which are currently being prepared for use in clinical trials in patients with cancer.

A cytarabine:daunorubicin molar ratio of 5:1 displayed the greatest degree of synergy and minimum antagonism in a panel of 15 tumor cell lines in vitro. Co-encapsulating cytarabine and daunorubicin inside liposomes maintained the synergistic drug ratio in plasma for 24 h post-injection. Liposome-encapsulated cytarabine:daunorubicin combinations exhibited drug ratio-dependent in vivo efficacy with the 5:1 molar drug ratio (designated CPX-351) having the greatest therapeutic index, despite using sub-MTD daunorubicin doses. CPX-351 exhibited superior therapeutic activity compared to free-drug cocktails, with high proportions of long-term survivors, consistent with in vivo synergy. The therapeutic advantage of …

Dense-granule exocytosis occurred in the apical area of the tachyzoite within minutes of invasion. Several exocytic events were found simultaneously in the same organism, both by serial sectioning and by freeze-fracture studies. Dense-granule contents were first found as a dense material trapped between parasite and vacuole membranes before either the vacuolar network or the vacuole membrane could be immunolabeled with specific antibodies. The vacuolar network was strongly labeled with dense-granule antibodies but not with the SAG1-specific probe, which suggests that the network is not enriched in membrane proteins. In addition to strongly labeling the vacuole membrane …

Several of the models showed improved survival times, but tumors eventually resumed growth, resulting in the death of the animals. The tumor site-related and systemic toxicities reported in preclinical studies of strictly anaerobic bacteria were not observed, although after a prolonged period, some subcutaneous tumors developed a central necrotic region. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis as a mechanism of evolution: status of cell symbiosis theory.|Lynn Margulis, D Bermudes|1985||1||101-124||Several theories for the origin of eukaryotic (nucleated) cells from prokaryotic (bacterial) ancestors have been published: the progenote, the direct filiation and the serial endosymbiotic theory (SET). Compelling evidence for two aspects of the SET is now available suggesting that both mitochondria and plastids originated by symbioses with a third type of microbe, probably a Thermoplasma-like archaebacterium ancestral to the nucleocytoplasm. We conclude that not enough information is available to negate or substantiate another SET hypothesis: that the undulipodia (cilia, eukaryotic flagella) evolved from spirochetes. Recognizing the power of symbiosis to recombine in single individual semes from widely differing partners, we develop the idea that symbiosis has been important in the origin of species and higher taxa. The abrupt origin of novel life forms through the formation of stable symbioses is consistent with certain patterns of evolution (eg punctuated equilibria) described by some paleontologists.

We have also isolated and sequenced cDNAs for NTP1 and NTP3; no cDNA for NTP2 was obtained. The two cDNA clones encode proteins that are more than 97% identical at the amino acid level but significantly differ within two small domains, indicating the presence of NTPase isoforms. Both possess N-terminal signal sequences and two regions with partial homology to certain known ATP binding motifs: the glycine-rich loop common to many ATP binding proteins and the beta-phosphate binding domain found …

The hydrophobicity of paclitaxel was increased by conjugating a succession of increasingly hydrophobic lipid anchors to the drug using succinate or diglycolate cross-linkers. The prodrugs were formulated in well defined block copolymer-stabilized nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to have an elimination half-life of approximately 24 h in vivo. The rate at which the prodrug was released from the nanoparticles could be controlled by adjusting the hydrophobicity of the lipid anchor, resulting in release half-lives ranging from 1 to 24 h. The diglycolate and succinate cross-linked prodrugs were 1−2 orders of magnitude less potent than paclitaxel in vitro. Nanoparticle formulations of the succinate prodrugs showed no evidence of efficacy in HT29 human colorectal tumor xenograph models. Efficacy of diglycolate …

Fusion hybrids were generated in vitro between weakly metastatic Cloudman S91 mouse melanoma cells and normal mouse or human macrophages. Hybrids were implanted s.c. in the tail and mice were monitored for metastases. Controls included parental S91 cells, autologous S91 × S91 hybrids, and B16F10 melanoma cells. Of 35 hybrids tested, most were more aggressive than the parental melanoma cells, producing metastases sooner and in more mice. A striking characteristic was heterogeneity amongst hybrids, with some lines producing no metastases and others producing metastases in up to 80% of mice. With few exceptions, hybrids with the highest metastatic potential also had the highest basal …

A quantitative relationship between the level of radioactivity accumulated and the number of bacteria in tumor and different tissues was demonstrated. The in vivo accumulation of [14 C] FIAU measured in tissue sample homogenates and sections were related to Salmonella number and to immunohistochemical bacterial staining, respectively. Quantitative autoradiography (QAR) revealed the relative intensity of [14 C] FIAU accumulation in a tumor cross-section, demonstrating that the peripheral region of the tumor …

The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration.

David Bermudes|Live bacteria as anticancer agents and tumor-selective protein delivery vectors.|David Bermudes, LM Zheng, Ivan C King|2002/3||5|2|194-199||The development of novel cancer therapies that are selective for cancer cells with limited toxicity to normal tissues is a challenge for oncology researchers. Microorganisms, such as viruses with selectivity for tumor cells or tumor micro-environments, have been investigated as potential arsenals for decades. Genetically-modified, non-pathogenic bacteria have begun to emerge as potential antitumor agents, either to provide direct tumoricidal effects or to deliver tumoricidal molecules. Attenuated Salmonella, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium are capable of multiplying selectively in tumors and inhibiting their growth, representing a new approach for cancer treatment. Because of their selectivity for tumor tissues, these bacteria would also be ideal vectors for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumors. VNP20009, an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, and its derivative, TAPET-CD, which expresses an Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD), are particularly promising, and are currently undergoing phase I clinical trials in cancer patients.

VNP20009 inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted B16F10 murine melanoma, and the human tumor xenografts Lox, DLD-1, A549, WiDr, HTB177, and MDA-MB-231. A single intravenous injection of VNP20009, at doses ranging from 1 × 104 to 3 × 106 cfu/mouse, produced tumor growth inhibitions of 57–95%. Tumor volume doubling time, another indicator for tumor growth inhibition, also significantly increased in mice treated with VNP20009. Using mice with immune system deficiencies, we also demonstrated that the antitumor effects of VNP20009 did not depend on the presence of T and B cells. In addition, VNP20009, given intravenously, inhibited the growth of lung metastases in mice. Only live bacteria showed the …

Rev.|58|3|387-400|American Society for Microbiology|In eukaryotic cells, microtubules are 24-nm-diameter tubular structures composed of a class of conserved proteins called tubulin. They are involved in numerous cell functions including ciliary motility, nerve cell elongation, pigment migration, centrosome formation, and chromosome movement. Although cytoplasmic tubules and fibers have been observed in bacteria, some with diameters similar to those of eukaryotes, no homologies to eukaryotic microtubules have been established. Certain groups of bacteria including azotobacters, cyanobacteria, enteric bacteria, and spirochetes have been frequently observed to possess microtubule-like structures, and others, including archaebacteria, have been shown to be sensitive to drugs that inhibit the polymerization of microtubules.

In vitro screening informatics on drug ratio–dependent cytotoxicity identified a consistently antagonistic region between irinotecan/cisplatin molar ratios of 1:2 to 4:1, which was bordered by two synergistic regions. Liposomal co-formulations of these two agents were developed that exhibited plasma drug half-lives of ∼6 hours and maintained a fixed drug ratio for more than 24 hours. Drug ratio–dependent antitumor activity was shown in vivo for these liposome formulations, and irinotecan … 
David Bermudes|Tumor-Targeted Salmonella|David Bermudes, Brooks Low, John Pawelek|2002||||57-63|Springer, Boston, MA|Genetically engineered Salmonella offer an intriguing new approach to selectively target solid tumors, including melanoma, lung, colon, breast, kidney and liver. These bacteria target tumors after systemic administration and selectively replicate within them. Specificity for tumors is often more than 1,000 times greater than for any other tissue. Auxotrophic mutations make these bacteria highly safe and form the basis for maintaining tumor specificity. An altered lipid greatly reduces the potential for septic shock yet also retains the antitumor properties of these bacteria. These bacteria have innate antitumor activity towards both primary and metastatic tumors and the ability to deliver proteins capable of activating chemotherapeutic agents directly within tumors. The delay in tumor growth results in mice that survive up to twice as long. These bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, allowing external …

Each treatment alone slowed tumour growth and prolonged survival, and the combined treatments produced supra-additive antitumour effects. That is, in dose–response studies with single doses of Salmonella and increasing doses of radiation, the two agents together caused suppression of tumour growth that was greater than that calculated for additivity. The results suggest that the combination of these genetically engineered Salmonella with radiotherapy could be a new and beneficial treatment for solid tumours.

Benzing, David H., Givnish, T.J. and Bermudes|1985|Systematic Botany|10|1|81-91||Brocchinia reducta, a tank-forming member of subfamily Pitcairnioideae (Bromeliaceae), possesses foliar trichomes capable of absorbing 3H-leucine as do those borne by other members of the same family (all Tillandsioideae and some species of Bromelioideae). In general, pitcairnioid trichomes have been considered incapable of participating in nutrient uptake. Other features of leaf anatomy and physiology, such as the presence of the C3 photosynthetic pathway, suggest that either 1) Brocchinia and tillandsioid tank shoots bearing absorptive hairs are a result of convergence or 2) both subfamilies acquired this feature from the same ancestor. All in all, Tillandsioideae and Pitcairnioideae share more vegetative features in common than either does with Bromelioideae and, thus, may be more closely related than was previously suspected. Tank deployment in Bromelioideae seems to have originated independently …

Following invasion and exocytosis of dense granules within the parasitophorous vacuole, GRA3 becomes associated with the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and extensions of the PVM which protrude into the cytoplasm. A partial cDNA encoding GRA3 was isolated from a Toxoplasma gondii expression library using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the mature GRA3 protein of tachyzoites. Antibodies affinity purified using the cloned fusion protein reacted with a 30-kDa band on immunoblots and recognized dense granules, the PVM, and PVM extensions by immunofluorescence staining of infected cells.

Experimental Design: We characterized CPG2 expression in vectors by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and enzyme activity. We assessed prodrug activation by high-performance liquid chromatography. Target human tumor cell and bacterial vector cell cytotoxicity was measured by flow cytometry and colony-forming assays. Therapy was shown in two human tumor xenografts and one mouse allograft with postmortem analysis of bacterial and CPG2 concentration in the tumors. Results: CPG2 is expressed within the bacterial periplasm. It activates prodrugs and induces cytotoxicity in human tumor cells but not in host bacteria. Following … 
David Bermudes|Upstream elements required for expression of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase genes of Toxoplasma gondii|Valerian Nakaar, David Bermudes, Kyong Ran Peck, Keith A Joiner|1998/5/1|Molecular and biochemical parasitology|92|2|229-239|Elsevier|Nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase is an abundant protein secreted by the obligate protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The protein has apyrase activity, degrading ATP to the di- and mono-phosphate forms. Because T. gondii is incapable of de novo synthesis of purines, it is postulated that NTPase may be used by the parasite to salvage purines from the host cell for survival and replication. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of NTP gene expression, we isolated from the virulent RH strain of T. gondii the putative promoter region of three tandemly repeated NTP genes (NTP1, 2, 3). Using deletion constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene, we defined an active promoter within the first 220 bp. Sequence analysis of this region reveals the lack of a TATA box, but the promoter region is associated with a sequence which resembles an initiator element (Inr) in the NTP1 and …

All anaerobic respiratory functions were restored by complementation of the mutants with specific cloned DNA fragments. Southern hybridization experiments revealed that the fragment that complements the MR-1 mutant was localized on the megaplasmids of both strains, while the fragment that complements the sp200 mutant was chromosomal. Neither of these fragments hybridized with the anaerobic regulatory genes of S. putrefaciens (etrA) or E. coli (fnr).

Hyphae were also common in and on nonorchid roots, but assignments of these relationships to known mycorrhizal morphologies was not possible in all cases. Evidence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) existed in a number of subjects while in Ericaceae and Campanulaceae a fungal association similar to the demateaceous surface fungi (DSF) described for alpine and prarie plants was usually present. Some associations were characterized by multicellular propagules on root surfaces. The significance of these findings and the factors likely to influence occurrence and consequences of root-fungus mutualisms in tropical forest canopies are discussed …

The culture was non-luminous growing submerged in defined liquid media with or without agitation. After a two- to three-day lag period on solid substrata, luminescence increased exponentially with a doubling time of 4 hours while the increase in colony radial growth was linear. On solid substrata, growth and total light emission were strongly correlated under most conditions studied. Optimal conditions included darkness; 28 C; pH 3.8; glucose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose or pectin as carbon source; and ammonia or asparagine as nitrogen source. Growth and luminescence were inhibited by ambient fluorescent light. Dark-grown colonies were brightest in the center while light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery …

A mutation that functions to constitutively activate pmrA [pmrA(Con)] suppresses msbB growth defects on EGTA-containing media. Lipid A structural analysis showed that Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains, compared to Salmonella msbB strains, have increased amounts of palmitate and phosphoethanolamine but no aminoarabinose addition, suggesting that aminoarabinose is not incorporated into msbB lipid A. Surprisingly, loss-of-function mutations in the aminoarabinose biosynthetic genes restored EGTA and polymyxin sensitivity to Salmonella msbB pmrA(Con) strains. These blocks in aminoarabinose biosynthesis also prevented lipid A phosphoethanolamine incorporation and reduced the levels of palmitate addition …

Genetically modified, nonpathogenic Salmonella offer a potential way to induce direct tumoricidal activity or to deliver tumoricidal agents to tumors. An attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium, called VNP20009, and its derivative TAPET-CD (which expresses Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase) are highly selective for tumor tissue and can deliver therapeutic proteins preferentially to tumors in preclinical models. Both VNP20009 and TAPET-CD have been investigated successfully in Phase 1 clinical trials in cancer patients.

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer-specific molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anti-cancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer... specific targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufficiently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce significant therapeutic effects. Recent findings suggest that the pathogenic bacteriumSallnonella, when genetically modified, can be used to …

Luminescence, varying among species, occurs in either the basidiocarp, the mycelium, the spores, or in combinations thereof (see O'Kane et al., 1990). Photometers have long been used to study bioluminescence (see Reynolds, 1972); however, perception ofluminescence in fungi has been largely by eye and/or documented photographically. Use of photometric measurements has generally been restricted to physiological studies of common species and examinations of the possible occurrence of bioluminescence in species suggested to be luminous (eg, Bermudes et al., 1990). Knowledge of the distribution of fungal luminescence, therefore, has been generally restricted by the detection limits of the human eye. Bioluminescence in fungi ranges …

David Bermudes|Symbiont acquisition as neoseme: origin of species and higher taxa.|D Bermudes, L Margulis|1987|Symbiosis (Philadelphia, Pa.)|4||185-198||We examine the hypothesis that, in the origin of species and higher taxa of eukaryotes, symbiont acquisition followed by partner integration has been equivalent to neoseme appearance leading to speciation. The formation of stable symbiotic associations involves partner-surface recognition, behavioral and metabolic interaction, and, in some cases, gene product (RNA, protein) and genic (RNA, DNA) integration. This analysis is applied here to examples of neosemes that define specific taxa and to neosemes in plants, fungi, and animals that involve the appearance of new types of tissue. If this hypothesis is correct--if the origin of major genetic variation leading to speciation and even higher taxa may occur through symbiont acquisition and integration--then the analysis of" origins of species and higher taxa" becomes analogous to the study of microbial community ecology.

It is hypothesized that mice would be more susceptible than other animal species to the toxic effects of VNP20009, because mice are the most sensitive natural host for the parental wild-type Salmonella typhimurium strain. These studies also compared the virulence of VNP20009 and the parental Salmonella in mice. In Cynomolgus monkeys and Yorkshire pigs (n = 2/dose), various doses (expressed as colony forming units [cfu] per animal) of VNP20009, or vehicle, were administered as a single IV injection (∼ 1 ml/min). The body weight, body temperature, clinical signs, clinical pathology (serum chemistry and hematology), and ophthalmic examinations (only in monkeys) were evaluated at various times.

David Bermudes|Intercontinental compatibility in Panellus stypticus with a note on bioluminescence|Ronald H Petersen, David Bermudes|1992|Persoonia-Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution of Fungi|14|4|457-463||Single-spore and polyspore cultures of Panellus stypticus from Japan were non-luminescent, while single-spore isolates from Illinois comprised both luminescent and nonluminescent strains. Luminous single-spore isolates exhibited varying levels of luminescence, and in some single-spore isolates, a delay in the onset of luminescence was observed. Japanese and eastern North American collections were universally sexually compatible, and thus belong to the same biological species. Nuclear migration beyond the contact zone between crossed single-spore strains was only occasionally observed, and was consistently accompanied by hyphal lysis of the receptor strain. Production of nuclei fit for nuclear migration appeared strain-specific, and not related to mating type genes.

Although the formulation demonstrated enhanced cisplatin tumor accumulation in preclinical models it did not enhance clinical efficacy, possibly due to limited cisplatin release from the formulation localized within the tumor. We have examined a series of liposomal formulations to address the in vivo relationship between cisplatin release rate and formulation efficacy in the P388 murine leukemia model. The base formulation of phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylglycerol: cholesterol was altered in the C18 and C16 phospholipid content to influence membrane fluidity and thereby impacting drug circulation lifetime and drug retention. Phase transition temperatures (Tm) ranged from 42–55°C. The high Tm formulations demonstrated enhanced drug retention properties accompanied by low antitumor activity while the lowest Tm formulations released the drug too rapidly in the plasma, limiting drug delivery to the tumor which also resulted in low antitumor activity. A formulation composed of DSPC : DPPC : DSPG : Chol; (35 : 35 : 20 : 10) with an intermediate drug release rate and a cisplatin plasma half-life of 8.3 hours showed the greatest antitumor activity. This manuscript highlights the critical role that drug release rates play in the design of an optimized drug delivery vehicle.

Long, hollow structures each comgosed of 13 protofilaments as revealed by electron microscopy, microtubules (240 A in diameter) are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes. These proteins have been the subject of intense biochemical and biophysical interest since the early 1970~’~ and are of evolutionary interest as well (eg, References 27 and 29). If tubulin-based structures (ie, neurotubules, mitotic spindle tubules, centrioles, kinetosomes, axonemes, etc.) evolved from spirochetes by way of motility symbioses, tubulin homologies with spirochete proteins should be detectable (see Reference 4). Tubulin proteins are widely thought to be limited to eukaryotes (eg, Reference 36). Yet both azotobacters’ and have shown immunological crossreactivity with antitubulin antibodies.

Numerous physical barriers exist in the delivery of therapeutic agents (including drugs, viruses, and liposomes) to solid tumors that can compromise the effectiveness (1), thus stimulating the search for alternative methods of delivery. Whereas it has been known for some time that spores of anaerobic Clostridium can germinate within the necrotic spaces of human tumors, they are limited to larger hypoxic tumors and are inaccessible to smaller metastases (2,3). The ability of motile, facultatively anaerobic Salmonella to target tumors following systemic administration, preferentially amplify within them, and express effector genes such as the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO 2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|Verena Karsten, Sean R Murray, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, David Bermudes|2009/12|BMC microbiology|9|1|170|BioMed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high osmolarity …

MsbB− salmonellae mutate extragenically to EGTA-tolerant derivatives at a frequency of 10−4 per division. One of these derivatives arose from inactivation of somA, which suppresses sensitivity to salt and EGTA. Here we show that a second mode of MsbB− suppression is a RecA-dependent deletion between two IS200 insertion elements present in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 but not in two other wild-type strains, LT2 and SL1344, which lack one of the IS200 elements. This deletion occurs spontaneously in wild-type and MsbB− strain 14028 salmonellae and accounts for about one-third of all of the spontaneous …

David Bermudes|Symbiosis inferred from the fossil record|David Bermudes, Richard C Back|1991|Margulis and Fester|||72-91||Fossil assemblages are notorious for their many biases. Notably, hard parts are more likely to be preserved than soft ones. The fossil record is largely a history of these hard parts from which past biology must be inferred. There is little direct evidence of symbiosis in the fossil record. Most microbial symbionts do not preserve well, and thus a host and a symbiont are seldom preserved together. Notable exceptions are the fungus-root associations found in Rhynie cherts dating to 400 million years ago (Kidston and Lang 1921; Boullard and Lemoigne 1971). These associations are sometimes interpreted as mutualistic mycorrhizae (Pirozynski and Malloch 1975; Malloch et al. 1980; Pirozynski and Dalpe 1989), although problems remain with interpretations of biological relationships based purely on morphology. Co-preservation insufficiently resolves the question of the influence of a biological relationship, and thus additional information must be sought. Actualistic assumptions have been applied to ecology (Mayr 1963) and genetics (Dobzhansky 1951) for the interpretation of the fossil record and, we believe, should be further extended to incorporate symbiosis. The field of symbiosis has long been a contributor to the understanding of biology (De Bary 1879; Mereschkovskii 1910; Wallin 1927), yet symbiosis remains largely peripheral to contemporary evolutionary theory. Several papers have already discussed the influence of symbiosis on evolutionary history (Taylor 1979, 1983; Cowen 1983; Margulis and Bermudes 1985; Bermudes and Margulis 1987). The purpose of this paper is to identify different ways in which symbiosis may have influenced …

We report here the development of nanoparticle delivery systems for hydrophobic drugs where plasma drug levels can be controlled in a manner that can be readily adapted to deliver drug combinations. Paclitaxel is a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug that is typically used in combination with other agents to treat breast, lung and ovarian cancer.

Compared with most other therapeutics, the effectiveness of tumour-targeting bacteria is not directly affected by the ‘genetic makeup’of a tumour. Bacteria initiate their direct antitumour effects from deep within the tumour, followed by innate and adaptive antitumour immune responses. As microscopic ‘robotic factories’, bacterial vectors can be reprogrammed following simple genetic rules or sophisticated synthetic bioengineering principles to produce and deliver anticancer agents on the basis of clinical needs. Therapeutic approaches using live tumour-targeting … 
David Bermudes|EGFR‐targeted Chimeras of Pseudomonas ToxA released into the extracellular milieu by attenuated Salmonella selectively kill tumor cells|David Quintero, Jamie Carrafa, Lena Vincent, David Bermudes|2016/12|Biotechnology and bioengineering|113|12|2698-2711||Tumor‐targeted Salmonella VNP20009 preferentially replicate within tumor tissue and partially suppress tumor growth in murine tumor models. These Salmonella have the ability to locally induce apoptosis when they are in direct contact with cancer cells but they lack significant bystander killing, which may correlate with their overall lack of antitumor activity in human clinical studies. In order to compensate for this deficiency without enhancing overall toxicity, we engineered the bacteria to express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐targeted cytotoxic proteins that are released into the extracellular milieu. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of the Salmonella strain VNP20009 to produce three different forms of the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ToxA) chimeric with a tumor growth factor alpha (TGFα) which results in its producing culture supernatants that are cytotoxic and induce apoptosis in EGFR positive … 
David Bermudes|A culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors|David Quintero, David Bermudes|2014/5/1|Journal of microbiological methods|100||105-110|Elsevier|We have developed a culture-based method for determining the production of secreted protease inhibitors. The assay utilizes standard proteolysis detection plates to support microbial growth followed by infiltrating the plate with a protease and subsequently detecting the remaining protein by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, or by bromocreosol green (BCG) or Ponseau S (PS) staining. The presence of a protease inhibitor can be observed in the form of a protected zone of protein around the protease inhibitor-producing strain. Using the protease inhibitors α-2-macroglobulin, aprotinin, leupeptin, and bestatin and the primary and secondary forms of Photorhabdus luminescens in combination with the protease trypsin, we were able to demonstrate that the assay is specific for the cognate inhibitor of the protease and for bacteria secreting protease inhibitors. In addition, when casein-containing plates were used … 
David Bermudes|Structure and function of the Toxoplasma gondii vacuole|Keith A Joiner, D Bermudes, A Sinai, H Qi, Vsevolod Polotsky, CJM Beckers|1996/10/1|Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|797|1|1-7|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that resides within a specialized vacuole inside host cells. The vacuolar space and surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) are the interface between the parasite and the host cell. Establishment and maintenance of the vacuole and PVM are dependent on temporally regulated secretion from three different secretory organelles, the rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules. Understanding the process of secretion and the localization and function of secreted parasite proteins provides important insights into the pathogenesis of infections with T. gondii. For this reason, we have been studying the structure and function of the PVM and of secreted parasite proteins in the vacuolar space and membrane. Our initial results showed that the newly formed PVM is fusion incompetent, being incapable of fusing with any vesicular organelle of the host … 
David Bermudes|Isolation and Analysis of Suppressor Mutations in Tumor-Targeted msbB Salmonella|K Brooks Low, Sean R Murray, John Pawelek, David Bermudes|2016||||95-123|Humana Press, New York, NY|Tumor-targeted Salmonella offers a promising approach to the delivery of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The Salmonella strains used, however, must be stably attenuated in order to provide sufficient safety for administration. Approaches to the generation of attenuated Salmonella strains have included deletion of the msbB gene that is responsible for addition of the terminal myristol group to lipid A. In the absence of myristoylation, lipid A is no longer capable of inducing septic shock, resulting in a significant enhancement in safety. However, msbB Salmonella strains also exhibit an unusual set of additional physiological characteristics, including sensitivities to NaCl, EGTA, deoxycholate, polymyxin, and CO2. Suppressor mutations that compensate for these sensitivities include somA, Suwwan, pmrA C , and zwf. We describe here methods for isolation of strains with compensatory …

The antitumor effect of TAPET-CD plus 5-FC against subcutaneously implanted colon tumors was also evaluated. TAPET-CD was given to tumor-bearing mice by a single bolus intravenous administration followed with 5-FC by intraperitoneal administration. TAPET-CD accumulated in tumors at levels 1000-fold higher than that in normal tissues and high levels of 5-FU were detected in tumors in mice treated with both TAPET-CD and 5-FC. No 5-FU could be detected in normal tissues. Inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with either TAPET-CD alone or TAPET-CD in combination with 5-FC (TAPET-CD/5-FC), but not with 5-FC alone. TAPET-CD/5-FC inhibited tumor growth by 88%-96%, compared to TAPET-CD alone, which inhibited tumor growth by 38%-79%. These data suggest that tumor-targeting Salmonella could be used to deliver prodrug-converting enzyme selectively to tumors and produced anti-tumor effects when the corresponding prodrug was also given.

We initially constructed chimeras of SFTI with N-terminal secretion signals from the Escherichia coli OmpA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ToxA, but only detected small amounts of protease inhibition resulting from these constructs. A substantially higher degree of protease inhibition was detected from a C-terminal SFTI fusion with E. coli YebF, which radiated more than a centimeter from an individual colony of E. coli using a culturebased inhibitor assay. Inhibitory activity was further improved in YebF-SFTI fusions by the addition of a trypsin cleavage signal immediately upstream of SFTI, and resulted in production of a 14-amino-acid, disulfide-bonded SFTI free in the culture supernatant. To assess the potential of the secreted SFTI to protect the ability of a cytotoxic protein to kill tumor cells, we utilized a tumor-selective form of the Pseudomonas ToxA (OTG-PE38K) alone and expressed as a polycistronic construct with YebF-SFTI in the tumor-targeted Salmonella VNP20009. When we assessed the ability of toxin-containing culture supernatants to kill MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, the untreated OTG-PE38K was able to eliminate all detectable tumor cells, while pretreatment with trypsin resulted in the complete loss of anticancer cytotoxicity. However, when OTG-PE38K was co-expressed with YebF-SFTI, cytotoxicity was completely retained in the presence of trypsin. These data demonstrate SFTI chimeras are secreted in a functional form and that co-expression of protease inhibitors with therapeutic proteins by tumor-targeted bacteria …

This drug ratio consistently displayed synergy in a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro whereas increasing or decreasing the drug ratio lead to decreased synergy and the appearance of antagonism based on median-effect analysis. CPX-1 has demonstrated markedly superior therapeutic activity over the free irinotecan:floxuridine drug cocktails in a range of preclinical solid tumor models and in vivo efficacy was also shown to be drug ratio dependent. Given the prevalent use of biological agents in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic CRC, we examined the effects of combining CPX-1 with BEV or CET in human CRC tumor xenografts with … 
David Bermudes|msbB deletion confers acute sensitivity to CO2 in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that can be suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in zwf|David Bermudes, Martina Ittensohn, Manvel Kondradzhyan, K Brooks Low, Sean R Murray, Verena Karsten, Jeremy Pike, Kimberly Troy|2009|||||Biomed Central|Pathogens tolerate stress conditions that include low pH, oxidative stress, high salt and high temperature in order to survive inside and outside their hosts. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations. We report here that msbB (or msbB somA) Salmonella are highly sensitive to physiological CO2 (5%), resulting in a 3-log reduction in plating efficiency. Under these conditions, msbB Salmonella form long filaments, bulge and lyse. These bacteria are also sensitive to acidic pH and high osmolarity. Although CO2 acidifies LB broth media, buffering LB to pH 7.5 did not restore growth of msbB mutants in CO2, indicating that the CO2-induced growth defects are not due to the effect of CO2 on the pH of the media. A transposon insertion in the glucose metabolism gene zwf compensates for the CO2 sensitivity of msbB Salmonella. The msbB zwf mutants grow on agar, or in broth, in the presence of 5% CO2. In addition, msbB zwf strains show improved growth in low pH or high osmolarity media compared to the single msbB mutant. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that msbB confers acute sensitivity to CO2, acidic pH, and high osmolarity. Disruption of zwf in msbB mutants restores growth in 5% CO2 and results in improved growth in acidic media or in media with high …

Drug effect and selectivity can be improved by increased understanding of molecular and cellular differences between cancer and normal tissues, thus enabling the design of drugs that potently affect cancer—speciﬁc molecular targets associated with malignant behaviour. Another approach is to improve the selective delivery of anticancer agents to tumours. One approach is to use carriers that bind to cancer~ speciﬁc targets, such as antibodies (Hall, 1995). However, most targeting approaches, even if selective, tend not to deliver sufﬁciently high concentrations of the agent to the tumour to induce signiﬁcant therapeutic effects.

Tumor volume doubling time, another indicator for tumor growth inhibition, also significantly increased in mice treated with VNP20009. Using mice with immune system deficiencies, we also demonstrated that the antitumor effects of VNP20009 did not depend on the presence ofT and B cells. In addition, VNP20009, given intravenously, inhibited the growth of lung metastases in mice. Only live bacteria showed the antitumor effect.

This selectivity occurred in subcutaneously implanted murine tumors, including Bl6FIO melanoma, M127 lung carcinoma, and colon 38 carcinoma. The preferential accumulation was also manifested in animals bearing human tumor xenografts, including Lox, C8186, DLDl. SW620, HCT l l6. HTB 177, DU145. MDA-MB-231, and Caki. Four to five days after a single IV injection of l x lO' colony-forming unit (cfu)/mouse, we routinely detected VNP20009 proliferation and accumulation at levels ranging from l x 10" to 2 x to'' cfu/g tumor. The amount of VNP20009 accumulated in the liver ranged from 3 x 10' to 2 x 10" cfu/g. The distribution of Salmonella in tumors was homogenous; YS72l2 cnuld he detected from the periphery to the interior portion of the tumors. Using mice with various immunodeficiencies. we also discoverd the same preferential accumulation of Salmonella in tumors implanted in these mice. The use of Salmonella as a protein delivery vector was shown by IV administration of the bacteria expressing either green f1uorescent protein (GFP) or cytosine deaminase (CD) into tumor-bearing mice. GFP and CD were detected in tumors, but not in livers, taken from mice inoculated with Salmonella carrying these genes. Bacteria accumulation and CD expression persisted in the tumors for up to 14 days after a single bolus IV administration of bacteria to tumor- bearing mice.

Controls included parental S91 melanoma cells, S91 S91 autologous hybrids, and highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells. Cells were implanted s.c. in the tail, and mice were monitored for metastases over 6 months. A striking characteristic of the hybrids was heterogeneity among individual cell lines, with metastases generated in mice ranging from 0- 100% of animals, and basal melanin content from amelanotic to supermelanotic. Heterogeneity was further augmented in vivo in that hybrids stably melanotic after repeated passage in culture occasionally produced amelanotic metastases in mice. With few exceptions, hybrids had elevated basal tyrosinase activity and were much more responsive to MSH compared to parental controls. The most aggressive hybrids were supermelanotic and also markedly more motile than parental cells in vitro. Autologous S91 S91 hybrids were even less metastatic and less motile than parental cells. Histologically, the metastatic hybrids demonstrated vascular invasion and spread to distant organs similar to that of metastatic melanomas in mice and humans. The hybrids resembled natural melanoma metastases so closely that they should serve as useful new models for this complex phenomenon.

In order to better understand this phenomenon, we carried out analyses of 30 separately isolated melanoma/macrophage hybrid lines, focusing on expression of differentiated functions characteristic of macrophages or melanocytes. Findings were as follows. 1) Hybrids contained DNA sequences from both parental lines. 2) Hybrids were supermelanotic and highly responsive to MSH compared to parental Cloudman cells. 3) Hybrids expressed fluoride-sensitive non-specific esterase activity characteristic of monocytes and macrophages. 4) EM studies revealed that the hybrids had melanosomes with organized lattice structures, reminscent of those in normal melanocytes, whereas melanosomes in the parental cells were typically amorphous. 5) Western blotting studies revealed that in many of the hybrids the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2, as well as the LAMP-1 protein migrated more slowly on electrophoretic gels than the analagous proteins expressed by parental melanoma cells. Further, LAMP-1 in hybrids migrated at an identical rate to that of macrophage LAMP-1. These differences were consistent with differences in protein glycosylation, as if a macrophage-like protein glycosyltransferase were expressed in the hybrids. In summary, hybrids formed between Cloudman melanoma cells and normal macrophages form highly aggressive tumors in mice, are supermelanotic, have normal appearing … 
David Bermudes|Macrophage characteristics of metastatic melanoma.|John Pawelek, Michael Rachkovsky, Stefano Sodi, Jean Bolognia, Ashok Chakraborty, Jennifer Madison, David Bermudes|1995|Journal of Investigative Dermatology|4|104|605||Since first proposed by Aichel (1911), expression of lymphocytic/monocytic traits has often been suggested as a mechanism for metastasis. Abilities to invade basment membranes and to home to lymph nodes, bone marrow, and distant organs are characteristics shared by lymphocytes, monocytes, and metastatic cancer cells alike. Previous studies showed that in vitro hybridization between normal lymphocytes or monocytes and transformed lymphoid cell lines resulted in increased agressiveness of the hybrid cells in vivo. However, such experiments had not been carried out with cells of solid tumor origin. Accordingly, we isolated clones of hybrids between normal mouse macrophages from DBA/2J mice and Cloudman S91 melanoma cells, using standard cell fusion and HAT selection techniques. Five hybrid clones were examined for their metastatic potential compared to the S91 parental cell line. First, in a Matrigel @ invasion assay, macrophage x melanoma hybrids showed increased abilities to cross an artificial biomatrix compared to S91 parental cells. Further, biomatrix invasion was dramatically increased in the hybrid clones but not in the parental S91 cells following exposure to MSH and IBMX. Second, in two separate experiments parental S91 cells and 5 macrophage x melanoma hybrids were inoculated s.c. into the tails of 20 DBA/2J mice. Mice inoculated with parental S91 cells did not die during the experiment and showed little or no evidence of metastases over 5 months.

David Bermudes|Microbial contributions to the Precambrian Earth|L Margulis, D Bermudes, R Obar|1986/5/1||||||Life has existed on Earth for approximately 3.5 billion years. For most of this time, prokaryotic communities provided the major biological forces changing the Earth. Many changes in atmospheric gas composition occurred during the Archean and Proterozoic eons as a result of microbial activity. Extant microbial communities were used to help understand the dynamics which contributed to these atmospheric changes. The microbial mat communities were characterized according to the organismic constituents. Symbiosis in microbial communities is recognized as a major force in cell evolution. Among the evolutinary enigmas investigated is the problem of the origin of the undulipodia. Undulipodial microtubules are still deployed for major cellular processes such as mitosis and meiosis. Several prokaryotes were tested for the presence of the S1-type protein, so far only spirochetes were found to possess it. The S1-type protein is being sought in cyanobacteria reported to contain microtubules.

Microbial processes of primary production and initial degradation at the most active zone of the microbial mat were analyzed. 
David Bermudes|Glutathione in cyanobacteria|David Bermudes|1985/7/1||||||The effects of light and O2 on glutathione production were determined. Results of light and dark studies under normal and reduced oxygen tensions were compared to determine the effect of reduction in oxygen tension on glutathione levels. The growth rate of Anacystis nidulans and concurrent production of glutathione is presented. The generation of time of Anacystis nidulans was approximately 12 hours. Results of light and dark incubation of Aphanothece halophytica dominated planktonic microbial community from Pond 4 and Anacystis nidulans under high and low oxygen tension is also presented. It appears that light grown Anacystis nidulans cells have equal amounts of glutathione while dark grown cells produce more glutathione in the presence of increased O2. 
David Bermudes|Planetary biology internship program|David Bermudes|1985/3/1|Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|16|1|93-93|Springer Netherlands|Earth is the last planet in our solar system to be studied as a planet. Since their origins, these bodies have undergone major surface and atmospheric changes. Unlike the changes on Mars and Venus, many of the surface changes on Earth are due to the effects of life. Not only are atmospheric gases such as O 2 and CH 4 biological products (from photosynthesis and methanogenesis, respectively), but many other atmospheric constituents are biogenic. The understanding of how Earth gave rise to life, how life has changed the planet, and the role that life plays in maintaining the present conditions on Earth as a whole are the concerns of Planetary Biology. The integrated study of Earth and its history as a planet involves not only space exploration and remote sensing techniques by satellite and airplane but also direct study of the origin~ and fossil record of life. Furthermore, an integrated understanding of our planet involves, among other … 
David Bermudes|Abstract C114|PG Tardi, TO Harasym, SA Johnstone, N Zisman, LD Mayer, D Bermudes|||||||CONCLUSIONS In vitro screening of irinotecan and cisplatin for median-effect combination indices (CI; Chou and Talalay 1984, Adv. Enzyme Reg. 22: 27-55) based on molar drug ratios. CI screening a human tumor cell line panel results in a fixed-ratio matrix “heat map” shown for drug concentrations resulting in an 80% fraction of cells affected (ED= 80). Green (CI< 1), synergy; yellow (CI~ 1), additivity; red (CI> 1), antagonism. Plasma levels of irinotecan and cisplatin were determined at five time points after iv administration in female CD-1 nude mice. A. Following injection of CPX-571 at an irinotecan dose of 60 μmoles/kg (41 mg/kg) and a cisplatin dose of 8.6 μmoles/kg (2.6 mg/kg), mouse plasma was isolated at the indicated times and assayed for irinotecan (●) and cisplatin (○) by HPLC. B. Based on the plasma drug levels, the molar ratio of irinotecan: cisplatin was calculated for each time point. All data points represent the mean values obtained from three mice per time point, and the error bars represent the SE.

The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was …

Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global context to DNA sequence data and a … 
Robert Espinoza|Recurrent evolution of herbivory in small, cold-climate lizards: breaking the ecophysiological rules of reptilian herbivory|Robert E Espinoza, John J Wiens, C Richard Tracy|2004/11/30|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|101|48|16819-16824|National Academy of Sciences|Herbivory has evolved in many groups of vertebrates, but it is rare among both extinct and extant nonavian reptiles. Among squamate reptiles, (lizards, snakes, and their relatives), <2% of the >7,800 species are considered to be herbivorous, and herbivory is restricted to lizards. Here, we show that within a group of South American lizards (Liolaemidae, ≈170 species), herbivory has evolved more frequently than in all other squamates combined and at a rate estimated to be >65 times faster. Furthermore, in contrast to other herbivorous lizards and to existing theory, most herbivorous liolaemids are small bodied and live in cool climates. Herbivory is generally thought to evolve only in reptile species that are large bodied, live in warm climates, and maintain high body temperatures. These three well known “rules” of herbivory are considered to form the bases of physiological constraints that explain the paucity of …

Liolaemus species form two well-supported monophyletic groups of subgeneric status, Liolaemus and Eulaemus. These subgenera appear to have separated at least 12.6 million years ago based on the amount of molecular evolutionary divergence between them.

Robert Espinoza|The importance of phylogenetic scale in tests of Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules: lessons from a clade of South American lizards|FB Cruz, LA Fitzgerald, RE Espinoza, JA Schulte Ii|2005/11|Journal of Evolutionary Biology|18|6|1559-1574|Blackwell Science Ltd|We tested for the occurrence of Bergmann's rule, the pattern of increasing body size with latitude, and Rapoport's rule, the positive relationship between geographical range size and latitude, in 34 lineages of Liolaemus lizards that occupy arid regions of the Andean foothills. We tested the climatic‐variability hypothesis (CVH) by examining the relationship between thermal tolerance breadth and distribution. Each of these analyses was performed varying the level of phylogenetic inclusiveness. Bergmann's rule and the CVH were supported, but Rapoport's rule was not. More variance in the data for Bergmann's rule and the CVH was explained using species belonging to the L. boulengeri series rather than all species, and inclusion of multiple outgroups tended to obscure these macroecological patterns. Evidence for Bergmann's rule and the predicted patterns from the CVH remained after application of phylogenetic … 
Robert Espinoza|Methods in comparative phylogeography, and their application to studying evolution in the North American aridlands|Robert M Zink|2002/11/1|Integrative and Comparative Biology|42|5|953-959|Oxford University Press|Historical biogeography and comparative phylogeography have much in common. Both seek to discover common historical patterns in the elements of biotas, although typically at different tiers of evolutionary history. Comparative phylogeography is based on phylogeographic analyses of multiple taxa, usually widespread species. By comparing the phylogeographic structures of numerous widespread sympatric species, one can infer whether the current fauna has been historically stable, as evidenced by the relative frequency of geographically congruent reciprocally monophyletic groups. Alternatively, if species distributions are ephemeral over evolutionary time, a mixture of phylogeographic structures is expected. Coalescence analyses contribute information about history irrespective of whether haplotype phylogenies are structured or not. In the aridlands of North America, several isolating events are evident … 
Robert Espinoza|A critical review and systematic discussion of recent classification proposals for liolaemid lizards|Fernando Lobo, Robert E Espinoza, Sebastian Quinteros|2010/7/26|Zootaxa|2549|1|1-30||We provide a critical review of a recent taxonomic revision of Chilean Liolaemus lizards (Iguania: Liolaemidae) by Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) and a recent paper (PincheiraDonoso et al. 2008), which proposed several new taxonomic and phylogenetic arrangements. We document fundamental problems with many of the proposed taxonomic revisions in both publications, which if followed, could lead to serious taxonomic confusion. In Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) a subgeneric classification is erected, which was produced by outdated methods (phenetic analyses), cannot be replicated (no matrix is presented), and is taxonomically untenable (some of the subgenera are nested within other subgenera). Most of the taxonomic groups that are proposed have been previously proposed, albeit differently constituted, yet often previous research is not given attribution; when findings are different, the research of others is either overlooked or dismissed without comment. The diagnoses of species and subspecies (including several newly proposed taxa) are often written in an authoritative manner (without supporting data or information), making them insufficient for distinguishing the focal taxon from others belonging to the same group, finally leading to uncertainty regarding the validity of several of the newly proposed taxa, combinations, or synonymies. We also describe less egregious errors of omission and commission. In Pincheira-Donoso et al.(2008), most of the proposals follow the Pincheira-Donoso and Núñez (2005) revisions, some species are allocated to groups without consistent cladistic support and other proposed relationships …

Recently, a few populations of L. alticolor from northwestern Argentina were reported to be reproductively bimodal-having both oviparous and viviparous females at the same locality. We reexamined lizards from these putatively bimodal populations and found evidence that these populations include two sympatric yet distinct species-one oviparous, the other viviparous. These species can also be distinguished from L. alticolor sensu stricto from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia). Here we describe the two new species, L. ramirezae and L. pagaburoi, from the province of Tucumán, Argentina. Liolaemus ramirezae differs from L. alticolor in having distinct neck folds, precloacal pores in females …

The desert tortoise was listed under the Endangered Species Act largely due to a newly recognized upper respiratory disease thought to cause mortality in individuals and severe declines in populations. Numerous hypotheses about the threats to the persistence of desert tortoise populations involve acquisition of nutrients, and its connection to stress and disease. The nutritional wisdom hypothesis posits that animals should forage not for particular food items, but instead, for particular nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus used in building bones. The optimal foraging hypothesis suggests that, in circumstances of resource abundance, tortoises should forage as dietary …

The new species were previously considered conspecific with either Liolaemus walkeri in northeastern Chile or L. alticolor in northwestern Argentina and adjacent Chile. However, the new species differ from these taxa, and all other members of the alticolor group, in a number of characteristics. Liolaemus chaltin n. sp. differs from L. alticolor from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia) in the following ways: this new species has a larger body size; a fragmented vertebral stripe; and a pigmented subocular (white in L. alticolor), and is one of just three members of the alticolor group that is oviparous. Liolaemus puna n. sp. differs from all other members of the alticolor group in that male L. puna lack paravertebral markings and dorsolateral and vertebral stripes. Females …

Both new species are saxicolous and inhabit rocky hills in the Puna regions of northwestern Argentina. One occurs in the Cerro de la Virgen, Nevados de Cachi and Nevados de Palermo of Salta Province. The other is known only from its type locality in the Cerro El Pichao of Tucumán Province. 
Robert Espinoza|Liolaemus heliodermis, a new lizard from northwestern Argentina with remarks on the content of the elongatus group (Iguania: Tropiduridae)|Robert E Espinoza, Fernando Lobo, Félix B Cruz|2000/12/1|Herpetologica|||507-516|Herpetologists' League|We provide a diagnosis for the Liolaemus elongatus group which currently includes six species (including the species described herein) of midsized, long-tailed, primarily saxicolous lizards. Most of these species are distributed along the Andean Cordillera of western Argentina where they principally occur at elevations above 1000 m. Here we describe Liolaemus heliodermis, a new species belonging to this group from the region where the Cumbres Calchaquíes and the Sierra del Aconquija mountain ranges converge in northwestern Tucumán Province. The new species differs from all other members of the elongatus group in several meristic characters and in the distinct coloration of the males: black heads with vibrant yellow torsos. Liolaemus heliodermis is the most northerly distributed member of the elongatus group and is the only member of the group known to occur in Tucumán Province. Preliminary …

Crotaphytid sperm differ from those of polychrotids in several respects, including: the structure of the perforatorium, the size of the epinuclear electron‐lucent region, aspects of the acrosome complex, the arrangement and structure of intermitochondrial dense bodies, and in the distance the fibrous sheath extends into the midpiece. The sperm of C. bicinctores, G. wislizenii, and A. carolinensis are most similar to those of the agamids and phrynosomatids examined to date.

Robert Espinoza|Herbivory imposes constraints on voluntary hypothermia in lizards|C Richard Tracy, Kevin M Flack, Linda C Zimmerman, Robert E Espinoza, Christopher R Tracy|2005/2|Copeia|2005|1|12-19||Animals that are unable to meet their metabolic needs should adopt compensatory behaviors to mitigate their energetic deficits. Voluntary hypothermia is one such energy-saving strategy. Physiological constraints associated with the digestion of plant tissues, however, may limit the thermoregulatory options of herbivorous ectotherms. In this laboratory study, selected body temperatures of Desert Iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), subjected to two different rations of a carnivorous and a herbivorous diet, were measured in a laboratory thermal gradient. Lizards fed a carnivorous diet and rationed to 50% of their daily energetic requirement selected significantly lower body temperatures than did lizards in the other diet/ration treatments. Lizards fed a herbivorous diet selected higher body temperatures than did the same lizards fed a carnivorous diet regardless of ration. Our study indicates that selected …

Robert Espinoza|Physiological benefits as precursors of sociality: why banded geckos band|Jennifer R Lancaster, Paul Wilson, Robert E Espinoza|2006/7/1|Animal Behaviour|72|1|199-207|Academic Press|Aggregating has been widely studied in a variety of animals and found to have important benefits in terms of sociality, courtship, predator avoidance and physiology. Several species of nocturnal geckos form diurnal aggregations; however, little is known about the benefits of these groupings. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the benefit of aggregation for the desert-dwelling western banded gecko, Coleonyx variegatus. We found that banded geckos benefit from aggregation by a reduction in evaporative water loss (EWL). No social or mating benefits were detected, and geckos did not group to avoid predators. Geckos did not select diurnal retreat sites based solely on the scent of conspecifics, although they aggregated readily when conspecifics were present. Thus, C. variegatus appear to achieve physiological but not social benefits from grouping. Banded geckos belong to an ancestrally tropical …

The new species shares the apomorphies of the P. palluma group including a fragmented subocular, square nonimbricate superciliaries, rugose and strongly mucronate dorsal caudals, and a midvertebral band of enlarged scales. Within the P. palluma group, the new species can be assigned to the Puna clade, with which it shares a dorsal pattern of small, dispersed brown spots and lack of black reticulations. The new species differs from other members of the Puna clade in several aspects of squamation and body pattern and color. Most notably, the new Phymaturus has a conspicuous yellow scapular spot, lacks a vertebral stripe, and has incomplete dark pigmentation over the dorsal neck. The new species is known only from the region of the type locality, the southernmost (and geographically isolated) extent … 
Robert Espinoza|A hot knot of toads: aggregation provides thermal benefits to metamorphic Andean toads|Robert E Espinoza, Sebastián Quinteros|2008/2/1|Journal of Thermal Biology|33|2|67-75|Pergamon|We tested the thermal benefits of aggregation (“knotting”) for a high-elevation (>4300 m) population of metamorphic Rhinella spinulosa. Fewer knots were recorded when the sun was low on the horizon and aggregating toads dispersed under cloudy skies or when experimentally shaded. Body temperatures of sun-exposed toads averaged 2.3 °C higher when in knots than when solitary. Proximity to water and similarity in body size between aggregating and solitary toads suggest that grouping is not imposed by a need for reducing evaporative water loss. Aggregation apparently provides thermal benefits, which should translate into faster growth. 
Robert Espinoza|Responses to prey and plant chemicals by three iguanian lizards: relationship to plants in the diet|Robert Espinoza, Jason Habegger, William Cooper|2001/1/1|Amphibia-Reptilia|22|3|349-361|Brill|We examined responses of three iguanian lizards, the phrynosomatid Sceloporus poinsettii and the tropidurids Tropidurus hispidus and Phymaturus punae, to prey chemicals and plant chemicals. When chemical stimuli were presented on cotton swabs or on ceramic tiles, neither S. poinsettii nor T. hispidus discriminated among prey, plant, and control stimuli. In contrast, an individual of P. punae discriminated both prey and plant chemicals from control stimuli in swab tests, typically biting swabs bearing prey or plant cues. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plant chemical discrimination evolves in herbivorous iguanians such as P. punae. Sceloporus poinsettii, which appears to be entirely insectivorous at some times, but eats substantial quantities of flowers at others, did not discriminate among the stimuli. Because all previously tested herbivores and omnivores responded strongly to prey and … 
Robert Espinoza|Diet quality does not affect resting metabolic rate or body temperatures selected by an herbivorous lizard|KE Nussear, RE Espinoza, CM Gubbins, KJ Field, JP Hayes|1998/4/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology B|168|3|183-189|Springer-Verlag|Diet quality can influence many aspects of digestion, but the links between diet quality and resting metabolism are poorly understood. In nature, it might be beneficial to reduce energy expenditure when only poor quality diets are available. Alternatively, animals might increase the processing capacity of the gut to more thoroughly extract energy. If maintaining the processing capacity of the gut is energetically expensive, then increasing gut size or function might result in higher resting metabolism. In ectotherms, most digestive functions are temperature dependent, thus another strategy to maintain energy balance might be to alter selected body temperatures. We tested whether differing concentrations of dietary fiber affected the resting metabolic rate or body temperatures selected by chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus) – lizards that naturally experience marked variation in dietary fiber. Resting metabolic rates … 
Robert Espinoza|Lizards on ice: Comparative thermal tolerances of the world's southernmost gecko|Denita M Weeks, Robert E Espinoza|2013/7/1|Journal of Thermal Biology|38|5|225-232|Pergamon|(1) We measured thermal tolerances (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and panting threshold, Tpant) for four populations of Homonota darwinii spanning most of the latitudinal range of the species. (2) CTmin differed across populations, but not latitudinally as predicted, likely because latitude was not as good a proxy for operative temperatures (Te). (3) Some populations had subzero CTmin indicating supercooling or freeze tolerance—the first time either phenomenon has been reported for a gecko. (4) Tpant did not differ significantly among populations. (5) The thermal tolerance breadth appears to be correlated with thermal variability in the environment. (6) Annual Te data indicate gecko retreats play a crucial role in surviving extreme surface temperatures (<0 or >50 °C).

Institutional challenges to field studies include decreasing financial resources and increasing regulatory concerns. These are coupled with changing student interests, in particular the growing misconception that field study is not relevant to many biological careers. Collectively, these factors contribute to a significant decline in field-study opportunities for students and lack of pedagogical guidance for instructors interested in conducting field courses. Nature and culture are inextricably linked, and we all benefit from including diverse backgrounds and perspectives in field experiences. We suggest expanding the definition of “the field” to include human-influenced ecosystems, as well as more … 
Robert Espinoza|Herbivory in Liolaemus poecilochromus, a small, cold-climate lizard from the Andes of Argentina|María Soledad Valdecantos, Federico Arias, Robert E Espinoza|2012/6/27|Copeia|2012|2|203-210|The American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists|Herbivory is generally thought to be restricted to reptiles with large body sizes that live in warm climates. We show that Liolaemus poecilochromus is primarily herbivorous (>80% plants in diet) even as juveniles, making them the smallest herbivorous reptile known. We detected relatively few differences in diet between the sexes, despite male-biased sexual dimorphism in head and body size. Adults consumed more mites and flowers than juveniles, and we detected a weak ontogenetic shift from omnivory to herbivory that is attributable to the lower volumetric consumption of plants by juvenile males. We discuss the abiotic and biotic conditions that likely selected for herbivory in this and other small-bodied, high-elevation Liolaemus.

At least 23 vertebrate families have unisexual lineages. Within squamate reptiles, >40 uniparental species have been described from five major lineages: acrodont iguanians, Gekkota, Serpentes, Scincomorpha, and Varanidae. Pleurodont iguanians include >1100 species, all of which have gonochoristic reproduction. Here we report the discovery of a new unisexual lizard from the liolaemid genus Liolaemus, a species-rich (∼260 species) clade distributed over most of southern South American. The new species, Liolaemus parthenos, is the only known all-female triploid pleurodont iguanian. The structural chromosome heteromorphisms of the karyotypes support the hypothesis that L. parthenos is the product of a hybrid origin. Based on morphology, the new species is … 
Robert Espinoza|A new Cyrtodactylus Gray, 1827 (Squamata, Gekkonidae) from the Shan Hills and the biogeography of Bent-toed Geckos from eastern Myanmar.|L Lee Grismer, PLJ Wood, Myint Kyaw Thura, Evan SH Quah, Marta S Grismer, Matthew L Murdoch, Robert E Espinoza, Aung Lin|2018/7|Zootaxa|4446|4|477-500||A phylogenetic taxonomic analysis indicates that a newly discovered population of Cyrtodactylus from the vicinity of Ywangan Town in the Shan Hills, Shan State, Myanmar is a new species (C. ywanganensis sp. nov.) and the earliest diverging member of the linnwayensis group within the previously defined Indochinese clade. The DIVALIKE+ J model of a BioGeoBEARS biogeographic analysis indicates that the Indochinese clade evolved in the Shan Hills and Salween Basin of eastern Myanmar and dispersed into Indochina on at least three separate occasions from 18.6-13.4 mya. Once there, uplift of the Tenasserim Mountains and Thai Highlands created the intermedius group, the oldhami group, and C. tigroides of western and southern Thailand which form sister lineages to the linnwayensis group, yathepyanensis group, and the sinyineensis group, respectively, of eastern Myanmar. Diverging lineages within the Indochinese clade highlight the importance of the Thai Highlands and Tenasserim Mountains in that group's evolution and speciation. The discovery of C. ywanganensis sp. nov. in karstic habitats in the Shan Hills continues to underscore the unrealized karst-associated herpetological diversity of this vast, relatively unexplored, upland region and the need for additional field studies.

Robert Espinoza|Body size, temperature, and the evolution of herbivory in reptiles.|Robert E Espinoza|2003||||4438-4438||I critically review the literature on the biology of Recent herbivorous reptiles to explain why it so few herbivorous reptiles have evolved (<1% of >8000 living species) and to identify the conditions that favor the evolution of herbivory. Despite their divergent evolutionary histories, most herbivorous reptiles live in warm climates, and have converged on a common suite of morphological, physiological, and life-history characteristics. Herbivory appears to evolve from omnivory, primarily in seasonal climates, and possibly results from an energetic deficit caused by switching between an herbivorous and a carnivorous diet. The mechanistic basis of this cost is hypothesized to be the consequence of changes in the community structure of fermentative endosymbionts that are responsible for digesting plant fiber and releasing energy and nutrients into their host''s gut. Most aspects of the biology of herbivorous reptiles have been poorly studied. Liolaemid lizards …

Newly collected samples from the type locality of C. peguensis and other localities indicate that this clade is endemic to central Myanmar and contains at least seven species, four of which are undescribed. Three species, including C. peguensis occur in the low hills of the Bago Yoma Range within the central portion of the Ayeyarwady Basin. Two of these, C. myintkyawthurai sp. nov. from the northern and central Bago Yoma and C. meersi sp. nov. which is syntopic with C. peguensis in the southern Bago Yoma are described herein. As more lowland hilly areas bordering, and within the Ayeyarwady Basin are surveyed, more new species of this group are likely to be discovered. These discoveries continue the recent surge of descriptions of new species of Cyrtodactylus that are being discovered in Myanmar. 
Robert Espinoza|Description of the female of the enigmatic lizard, Liolaemus heliodermis (Iguania: Liolaemidae)|RAYMOND A Hernandez, Robert E Espinoza|2004/9/1|Herpetological Review|35|3|227-228|Lawrence, Kan.: Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, 1967-|The lizard genus Liolaemus has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. In the past decade an average of four new species has been described each year and dozens more await description (Etheridge and Espinoza 2000). Given this trend, and recent estimates of cryptic diversity in some clades (eg, Lobo and Espinoza 1999; Morando et al. 2003), Liolaemus may someday surpass even Anolis (sensu lato) in species richness. Currently, Liolaemus includes approximately 160 species. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis (Schulte et al. 2000) of 60 species representing all major Liolaemus lineages recovered two similarly sized clades and corroborated the results of several morphological studies (reviewed by Etheridge 1995). One of these major clades, the chiliensis group, includes approximately 80 species and has been further divided into numerous subgroups (Etheridge 1995; Lobo 2001). One of these subgroups, the elongatus-kriegi group (sensu Morando et al. 2003; see also Cei 1979), has experienced recent growth with the addition of seven species since 2000 (Avila et al. 2003, 2004; Cei and Videla 2003; Espinoza et al. 2000; Espinoza and Lobo 2003). Moreover, molecular analyses of populations in southern Argentina suggest that the elongatus-kriegi group may include as many as three times the number of species currently recognized (Morando et al. 2003). Given their recent discovery and remarkable diversity, the natural and life history of most species belonging to this group is poorly understood. Among members of the elongatus-kriegi group, L. heliodermis is likely the most enigmatic. This species belongs to a …

Tylototriton ngarsuensis sp. nov. differs from other closely related species of Tylototriton on basis of varying combinations of characteristics associated with it shorter head, larger size, rib nodule morphology, and overall drab, very dark, coloration, along with its genetic differentiation. Tylototriton ngarsuensis sp. nov. also appears to breed later in the year than most other species. Unfortunately, this species like many other Asian newts, is being harvested for the pet and medicinal trade and given its restricted distribution, this could pose a serious threat to its long-term survival.

We show that the evidence does not support Núñez's (2004) proposal. We first document the complex taxonomic history of L. p. major, the lack of a precise or even definitive type locality, and the implications of the latter on subsequent checklists and research. Second, we note differences between Boulenger's (1885) type description of L. p. major and Hulse's (1979) type description of L. capillitas. Third, we show that the syntypes of L. p. major photographed by Núñez (2004) do not exhibit the character states of L. capillitas. We conclude that L. capillitas is not a synonym of L. p. major. Based on the available evidence, the syntypes of L. p. major are probably assignable to Liolaemus elongatus from …

Robert Espinoza|The conservation status of the world´ s reptiles|Felix Benjamin Cruz, Robert Espinoza, Marcelo Fabio Tognelli|2013|||||Elsevier|Effective and targeted conservation action requires detailed information about species, their distribution, systematics and ecology as well as the distribution of threat processes which affect them. Knowledge of reptilian diversity remains surprisingly disparate, and innovative means of gaining rapid insight into the status of reptiles are needed in order to highlight urgent conservation cases and inform environmental policy with appropriate biodiversity information in a timely manner. We present the first ever global analysis of extinction risk in reptiles, based on a random representative sample of 1500 species (16% of all currently known species). To our knowledge, our results provide the first analysis of the global conservation status and distribution patterns of reptiles and the threats affecting them, highlighting conservation priorities and knowledge gaps which need to be addressed urgently to ensure the continued survival of the world?s reptiles. Nearly one in five reptilian species are threatened with extinction, with another one in five species classed as Data Deficient. The proportion of threatened reptile species is highest in freshwater environments, tropical regions and on oceanic islands, while data deficiency was highest in tropical areas, such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia, and among fossorial reptiles. Our results emphasise the need for research attention to be focussed on tropical areas which are experiencing the most dramatic rates of habitat loss, on fossorial reptiles for which there is a chronic lack of data, and on certain taxa such as snakes for which extinction risk may currently be underestimated due to lack of population information …

Liolaemus chaltin n. sp. differs from L. alticolor from the type locality (Tiahuanaco, Bolivia) in the following ways: this new species has a larger body size; a fragmented vertebral stripe; and a pigmented subocular (white in L. alticolor), and is one of just three members of the alticolor group that is oviparous. Liolaemus puna n. sp. differs from all other members of the alticolor group in that male L. puna lack paravertebral markings and dorsolateral and vertebral stripes. Females, however, are similar to other members of the alticolor group but can be distinguished from them by several meristic characters. Liolaemus puna is widely distributed throughout the high-elevation (3680-4400 m) Puna regions (a flat or gently sloping steppe dominated by perennial bunch grasses and small shrubs) in northwestern Argentina and northeastern Chile. Liolaemus chaltin is known only from the Puna of central Jujuy Province, Argentina (3400-3750 m). Based on examinations of the type series of L. alticolor and L. walkeri, we determined that virtually all northern Chilean populations of Liolaemus previously considered to belong to either of these two species should be assigned to L. puna. Thus, the range of L. alticolor is restricted to …

That which is rare demands explanation. For these reasons, herbivorous reptiles have captured the attention of herpetologists for decades. Indeed, fewer than 1% of nonavian reptiles-both extinct and modern-were, or are, herbivorous. The paucity of herbivorous reptiles has been attributed to numerous factors including constraints associated with morphology, physiology, behavior, biogeography, evolutionary history, and divergence capabilities. Yet, despite a long and rich history of interest, no comprehensive treatise has been provided for this understudied trophic group of the Reptilia. This void is now partly filled by Gillian King's Reptiles and Herbivory. King, a paleontologist specializing in mammal-like reptiles (primarily dicynodonts), has produced a book that convenes much of the disparate literature on both extant and extinct reptilian herbivores …

Passerines as a whole and five passerine subclades were analyzed by both independent contrasts and simulation methods. In passerines as a whole, carotenoids and sexual dichromatism are positively correlated irrespective of analysis method. In three of the subclades, the correlations are significant by a clear majority of analysis methods. Neither melanin nor structurally derived colors show similar significant increases with dichromatism. Carotenoids are obtained by animals solely through the diet, whereas both melanins and structurally derived colors can be synthesized. The relationship between sexual dichromatism and the use of carotenoids in plumage suggests that sexual selection may have promoted the expression of a … 
David Gray|Sexual selection and speciation in field crickets|David A Gray, William H Cade|2000/12/19|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|97|26|14449-14454|National Academy of Sciences|Recent theoretical work has shown that sexual selection may cause speciation under a much wider range of conditions than previously supposed. There are, however, no empirical studies capable of simultaneously evaluating several key predictions that contrast this with other speciation models. We present data on male pulse rates and female phonotactic responses to pulse rates for the field cricket Gryllus texensis; pulse rate is the key feature distinguishing G. texensis from its cryptic sister species G. rubens. We show (i) genetic variation in male song and in female preference for song, (ii) a genetic correlation between the male trait and the female preference, and (iii) no character displacement in male song, female song recognition, female species-level song discrimination, or female song preference. Combined with previous work demonstrating a lack of hybrid inviability, these results suggest that … 
David Gray|Female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, prefer the chirps of large males|David A Gray|1997/12/1|Animal behaviour|54|6|1553-1562|Academic Press|This study demonstrates that invertebrate acoustic signals can provide information about male phenotypic attributes, and that females can use this acoustic information in mate choice to select a phenotypically superior mate. I investigated the relationships between a male acoustic sexual signal, the phenotype of the signaller, and the female response to signal variation. I recorded and analysed the calling songs of male house crickets,Acheta domesticus. The analyses showed that chirps convey information about male size. With the exception of amplitude, the mean number of pulses per chirp was the best predictor of male size. I performed a laboratory tape-playback experiment to determine female preference during phonotaxis. Females preferred tapes playing the chirps of large males, specifically chirps with a greater number of pulses per chirp. Selection on the female preference is discussed. 
David Gray|Intrinsic factors affecting female choice in house crickets: time cost, female age, nutritional condition, body size, and size-relative reproductive investment|David A Gray|1999/9/1|Journal of Insect Behavior|12|5|691-700|Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers|Few studies have examined potential costs of female choice and factors intrinsic to females that affect choice. To examine these factors, female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, were presented with a simultaneous choice between tapes of a priori attractive and unattractive male chirps. Females varied in age, nutritional condition, body size (potential fecundity), and size-relative reproductive investment. Female age had a significant effect on female choosiness: young females were selective, whereas older females were not selective. Nutritional condition, body size, and size-relative reproductive investment did not affect female choice. Females that chose the call of the attractive male spent approximately twice as long choosing as females that chose the unattractive male call. 
David Gray|QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE FIELD CRICKET, GRYLLUS INTEGER|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/6|Evolution|53|3|848-854||Major theories of sexual selection predict heritable variation in female preferences and male traits and a positive genetic correlation between preference and trait. Here we show that female Texas field crickets, Gryllus integer, have heritable genetic variation for the male calling song stimulus level that produces the greatest phonotactic response. Approximately 34% of the variation in female preferences was due to additive genetic effects. Female choosiness, that is, the strength of the female response to her most preferred stimulus relative to her average response to all stimuli, did not show significant genetic effects. The male calling song character was not related to male size or age but did show significant genetic effects. Approximately 39% of the variation in the number of pulses per trill was due to additive genetic variation. The genetic correlation estimated for the field population was 0.51 ± 0.17. The number of … 
David Gray|Sex, death, and genetic variation: natural and sexual selection on cricket song|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/4/7|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences|266|1420|707-709|The Royal Society|Male field crickets, Gryllus integer, in Texas, USA, produce a trilled calling song that attracts female crickets, resulting in enhanced mating success. Gravid female parasitoid flies, Ormia ochracea, are also attracted to male cricket calling song, resulting in the death of the male within about seven days. Using playbacks of field–cricket calling song in the natural habitat, we show that both female crickets and female parasitoid flies prefer male calling song with average numbers of pulses per trill. Thus female crickets exert stabilizing sexual selection, whereas flies exert disruptive natural selection on male song. Disruptive natural selection will promote genetic variation and population divergence. Stabilizing sexual selection will reduce genetic variation and maintain population cohesiveness. These forces may balance and together maintain the observed high levels of genetic variation (ca. 40%) in male calling song. 
David Gray|Is cricket courtship song condition dependent?|David A Gray, Gillian Eckhardt|2001/11/1|Animal Behaviour|62|5|871-877|Academic Press|Females of the Texas trilling field cricket, Gryllus texensis, show mating preferences based on male courtship song. To test experimentally the condition dependence of courtship song, we attempted to manipulate male condition via the diet. When the diet was manipulated at the adult moult, there was no effect on subsequent male courtship song or male condition measured as residual mass. When the diet was manipulated three moults prior to the adult moult, there was a significant effect on male residual mass, but no differences in courtship song were observed. To gain a second measure of condition in the diet-manipulated-as-nymphs group, we extracted their fat using petroleum ether in a refluxing Soxhlet apparatus. Crickets reared on the poor diet showed a clear relationship between the residual mass measure of condition and condition measured as energetic fat reserve, whereas the two measures of … 
David Gray|Fine-scale temperature effects on cricket calling song|Shannon D Martin, David A Gray, William H Cade|2000/5/1|Canadian Journal of Zoology|78|5|706-712|NRC Research Press|The effects of temperature on the structure of cricket calling song were examined in the trilling field cricket Gryllus integer. A repeated-measures design was used to assess the effects of temperature and individual differences among males simultaneously. Temperature affected most aspects of calling song, specifically pulse length, interpulse length, peak frequency, trill length, intertrill length, and pulse duty cycle. Unaffected by temperature were the number of pulses per trill, the proportion of pulses missed within a trill, and the trill duty cycle. After controlling for temperature, significant individual differences among crickets were found in peak frequency, number of pulses per trill, trill length, and intertrill interval. Both the environmental and individual, that is, possibly genetic, influences on calling song may influence sexual communication in this species. 
David Gray|Diversification under sexual selection: the relative roles of mate preference strength and the degree of divergence in mate preferences|Rafael L Rodríguez, Janette W Boughman, David A Gray, Eileen A Hebets, Gerlinde Höbel, Laurel B Symes|2013/8|Ecology letters|16|8|964-974||The contribution of sexual selection to diversification remains poorly understood after decades of research. This may be in part because studies have focused predominantly on the strength of sexual selection, which offers an incomplete view of selection regimes. By contrast, students of natural selection focus on environmental differences that help compare selection regimes across populations. To ask how this disparity in focus may affect the conclusions of evolutionary research, we relate the amount of diversification in mating displays to quantitative descriptions of the strength and the amount of divergence in mate preferences across a diverse set of case studies of mate choice. We find that display diversification is better explained by preference divergence rather than preference strength; the effect of the latter is more subtle, and is best revealed as an interaction with the former. Our findings cast the action of …

Few studies have partitioned fighting behavior into its component agonistic displays and evaluated the relationships between the frequency of the displays and the potential benefits of fighting, particularly mating success. In this study, we quantified the frequency of male field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, agonistic displays. The displays were quantified under three social environments which varied in the potential benefits of fighting: males with other males only, males with other males and female scents, and males with other males and females. We found that (1) the presence of females elicited an increase in agonistic displays characteristic of intermediate levels of escalation, (2) female scents did not produce a similar increase in the frequency of agonistic displays, and (3) in the presence of females, the frequency of agonistic displays was positively … 
David Gray|Divergence between the courtship songs of the field crickets Gryllus texensis and Gryllus rubens (Orthoptera, Gryllidae)|Mark J Fitzpatrick, David A Gray|2001/12/29|Ethology|107|12|1075-1085|Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)|Acoustic mating signals are often important as both interspecific prezygotic isolating mechanisms and as sexually selected traits in intraspecific mate choice. Here, we investigate the potential for cricket courtship song to act as an isolating mechanism by assessing divergence between the courtship songs of Gryllus texensis and Gryllus rubens, two broadly sympatric cryptic sister species of field crickets with strong prezygotic isolation via the calling song and little or no postzygotic isolation. We found significant species‐level differences in the courtship song, but the song has not diverged to the same extent as the calling song, and considerable overlap remains between these two species. Only two related courtship song characters are sufficiently distinct to play a possible role in prezygotic species isolation. 
David Gray|Does courtship behavior contribute to species-level reproductive isolation in field crickets?|David A Gray|2004/7/21|Behavioral Ecology|16|1|201-206|Oxford University Press|Reproductive behavior influences gene flow within and among species; thus, sexual selection may be a major contributor to the maintenance of species, and possibly their formation. Here I experimentally manipulate the courtship interactions of the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis to examine the potential of close-range courtship interactions to limit interspecific gene flow. Responses of males to females and of females to male courtship song and males per se were examined for four paired sympatric and allopatric populations. Male G. rubens were more likely to court conspecific females, but male G. texensis courted females of both species equally. If paired with conspecific males, female G. rubens and G. texensis both preferred conspecific courtship song. In none of these comparisons were the responses of males or females from allopatry different from those in sympatry. There was an asymmetry …

Efforts to find an alternative, virus-resistant field cricket species have led to the widespread USA (and European) distribution of a previously unnamed Gryllus species despite existing USA federal regulations to prevent such movement. We analyze and describe this previously unnamed Gryllus and propose additional measures to minimize its potential risk to native fauna and agriculture. Additionally, and more worrisome, is our incidental finding that the naturally widespread African, European, and Asian “black cricket,” G. bimaculatus, is also being sold illegally in southern California pet food stores. We assayed crickets of all five USA and European commercial species for presence of the AdDNV to document extent of the infection—all five species can be infected with the virus but only A. domesticus is killed. Based on its already cosmopolitan distribution, apparent inability to live away from human habitation, and resistance to AdDNV, we suggest that Gryllodes sigillatus is the best-suited replacement cricket for commercial production. 
David Gray|Size–dependent response to conspecific mating calls by male crickets|Moshe Kiflawi, David A Gray|2000/11/7|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences|267|1458|2157-2161|The Royal Society|Male sexual displays provide females with information that is crucial to their reproductive decisions. That same information is available to eavesdroppers, with potential consequences for both signaller and receiver. We present empirical evidence for size–dependent responses to intersexual communication by conspecific rivals. Acoustic features of a male house cricket's (Acheta domesticus) mating call are positively associated with its size, with females preferring the calls of larger males. In order to investigate whether conspecific males make use of the information content of mating calls, we examined their phonotactic responses to call recordings that differ in attractiveness to females. Males of all sizes exhibited positive phonotaxis, with smaller males showing a clear preference for female–preferred calls. Smaller males were also less likely to seek contact with the speaker playing their chosen call. We discuss …

What is less well characterized is the behavioural specialization of parasites that exploit different hosts in different parts of the parasite's geographical range. Here we examine behavioural specialization among populations of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, that exploit different host species of crickets in different parts of the fly's range. We conducted a field experiment to compare phonotactic attraction of flies from Florida, Texas, California and Hawaii (U.S.A.) to the songs of their local host species of cricket versus their attraction to the songs of species of crickets utilized as hosts elsewhere within the flies' range. We found strong behavioural specialization of fly populations, with preferential phonotaxis towards the song of the local host species of cricket. These results suggest strong behavioural specialization of flies, but that … 
David Gray|Heterospecific courtship and sequential mate choice in sister species of field crickets|Amanda S Izzo, David A Gray|2011/1/1|Animal behaviour|81|1|259-264|Academic Press|During mate selection, females of most species encounter males sequentially and may use a variety of decision rules whereby the attractiveness of a current potential mate is affected by sampling of previous individuals. The perceived distribution of male quality might therefore affect female mate choice. Mate choice among closely related taxa may additionally be affected by a perceived rarity of conspecifics. Here we tested whether female mate choice in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis is affected by prior experience with either conspecific or heterospecific males. Specifically, we tested whether female acceptance of conspecific or heterospecific males is influenced by prior exposure to a conspecific or heterospecific male. Our results indicate that there is a clear previous-male effect, but that it differs across species. When ‘high-quality’ (i.e. conspecific) males are common, females are predicted to … 
David Gray|Cricket Song in Sympatry: Species Specificity of Song without Reproductive Character Displacement in Gryllus rubens|Amanda S Izzo, David A Gray|2004/7/1|Annals of the Entomological Society of America|97|4|831-837|Entomological Society of America|Previous work with the cryptic sister species pair of field crickets, Gryllus texensis Cade & Otte and Gryllus rubens Scudder, has implicated sexual selection in the speciation process. That study examined reproductive character displacement (RCD) in male song and female preference for song in G. texensis. No evidence of RCD was found. Here, we provide a similar analysis of RCD in G. rubens song and examine the songs of both species from areas of sympatry in an effort to document the species-specificity of song in sympatry and to look for individuals with songs indicative of F1 hybrid status. We 1) find no evidence for RCD in G. rubens song, 2) demonstrate the distinctness of song in sympatry, and 3) document the rarity of songs typical of F1 hybrids.

One such species, Gryllus assimilis (F.), as currently characterized, occurs in the West Indies, Brazil, Central America, and Mexico, and in five of the southernmost U.S. states. Our studies of calling songs and morphology indicate that at least three species exist among these populations. The type locality of G. assimilis is Jamaica, but the type specimen is lost and two similar species of Gryllus occur there. One of these species occurs widely outside of Jamaica, and we assign it to G. assimilis and designate a neotype. The other occurs only in Jamaica and is assigned to Gryllus jamaicensis T. J. Walker n. sp. Nearly all populations formerly known as G. assimilis from southern California, southern Arizona, southern Nevada, and Mexico west … 
David Gray|Song repertoires and sensory exploitation: reconsidering the case of the common grackle|David A Gray, Julie C Hagelin|1996/10/1|Animal Behaviour|52|4|795-800|Academic Press|Male common grackles,Quiscalus quiscula, sing one song type each, yet females prefer multiple songs. A pre-existing sensory bias explanation has been proposed to account for these results. Using phylogenetic analysis and published behavioural studies, (1) it is shown that the single-song condition of males is likely to be the derived state, and (2) it is suggested that female common grackles' preference for multiple songs may not be surprising given their natural history, and may in fact be a functional preference. The idea that the female preference is also ancestral and serves no current function, however, cannot be ruled out. 
David Gray|Conservation of multivariate female preference functions and preference mechanisms in three species of trilling field crickets|T Blankers, RM Hennig, DA Gray|2015/3|Journal of evolutionary biology|28|3|630-641||Divergence in mate recognition systems among closely related species is an important contributor to assortative mating and reproductive isolation. Here, we examine divergence in male song traits and female preference functions in three cricket species with songs consisting of long trills. The shape of female preference functions appears to be mostly conserved across species and follows the predictions from a recent model for song recognition. Multivariate preference profiles, combining the pulse and trill parameters, demonstrate selectivity for conspecific pulse rates and high trill duty cycles. The rules for integration across pulse and trill timescales were identical for all three species. Generally, we find greater divergence in male song traits than in associated female preferences. For pulse rate, we find a strong match between divergent male traits and female peak preferences. Preference functions for trill …

When species divergence is relatively recent, the footprint of the demographic history during speciation might be preserved and used to reconstruct the biogeography of species divergence. In this study, patterns of genetic variation were examined throughout the geographical range of two cryptic sister taxa of field crickets, Gryllus texensis and G. rubens; mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) was sequenced in 365 individuals sampled from 48 localities. Despite significant molecular divergence between the species, they were not reciprocally monophyletic. We devised several analyses to statistically explore what historical processes might have given rise to this genealogical structure. The analyses indicated that the biogeographical pattern of genetic …

Here, we review and analyze via simulation Hedges’ g, a widely used parametric estimate of effect size. Our analyses indicate that g is sensitive to a combination of unequal trait variances and unequal sample sizes among populations and to changes in the scale of measurement. We then go on to derive and explain a new, non-parametric distance measure, “Δp”, which is calculated based upon a joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) from all populations under study. More precisely, distances are measured in terms of the percentiles in this CDF at which each population’s median lies. Δp combines many desirable features of other distance metrics into a single metric; namely, compared to other metrics, p … 
David Gray|How acoustic signals scale with individual body size: common trends across diverse taxa|Rafael L Rodríguez, Marcelo Araya-Salas, David A Gray, Michael S Reichert, Laurel B Symes, Matthew R Wilkins, Rebecca J Safran, Gerlinde Höbel|2014/10/3|Behavioral ecology|26|1|168-177|Oxford University Press|We use allometric analysis to explore how acoustic signals scale on individual body size and to test hypotheses about the factors shaping relationships between signals and body size. Across case studies spanning birds, crickets, tree crickets, and tree frogs, we find that most signal traits had low coefficients of variation, shallow allometric scalings, and little dispersion around the allometric function. We relate variation in these measures to the shape of mate preferences and the level of condition dependence of signal traits. We find 3 major patterns: 1) signal traits associated with closed mate preferences had lower coefficients of variation and shallower allometries than signal traits with open preferences, 2) signal traits with higher levels of condition dependence had higher coefficients of variation and steeper allometries, and 3) the relationship between condition dependence and allometry varied with preference … 
David Gray|Host song selection by an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly exploiting a multispecies assemblage of cricket hosts|Kelly M Sakaguchi, David A Gray|2011/4/1|Animal Behaviour|81|4|851-858|Academic Press|Specialization by predators, parasites and parasitoids is often viewed as adaptive because specialization will usually increase search efficiency for suitable hosts (prey). Although many studies have documented interspecific variation in the degree of host specialization, few studies have examined intraspecific variation in specialization among different populations exploiting different numbers of hosts, and even fewer have specifically examined variation in behavioural specialization. Here we examine the acoustic preferences of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, which attacks several Gryllus species of field crickets by using the male cricket song to locate hosts. All previous studies with this system have examined fly song preferences in populations of flies that primarily exploit a single host species of cricket. Here we tested a population of flies that naturally parasitizes multiple cricket species. We found significant … 
David Gray|Describing mate preference functions and other function‐valued traits|JT Kilmer, KD Fowler‐Finn, DA Gray, G Höbel, D Rebar, MS Reichert, RL Rodríguez|2017/9|Journal of evolutionary biology|30|9|1658-1673||Mate preferences are important causes of sexual selection. They shape the evolution of sexual ornaments and displays, sometimes maintaining genetic diversity and sometimes promoting speciation. Mate preferences can be challenging to study because they are expressed in animal brains and because they are a function of the features of potential mates that are encountered. Describing them requires taking this into account. We present a method for describing and analysing mate preference functions, and introduce a freely available computer program that implements the method. We give an overview of how the program works, and we discuss how it can be used to visualize and quantitatively analyse preference functions. In addition, we provide an informal review of different methods of testing mate preferences, with recommendations for how best to set up experiments on mate preferences. Although the … 
David Gray|The judder of the cricket: The variance underlying the invariance in behavior|Sergio M Pellis, David A Gray, William H Cade|2009|||||International Journal of Comparative Psychology|While the behavior of many animals can be identified as involving discrete and stereotyped actions, there is a persistent tension between emphasizing the fixedness of the actions (“Fixed Action Patterns”) and emphasizing the variation in the components comprising those actions (“Modal ActionPatterns”). One such action, the back and forward judder of crickets often exhibited in agonistic interactions, was analyzed. Judders occurring on a horizontal surface by Gryllus bimaculatus were compared to those occurring on an inclined platform. Although the body movements involved were variable, that variability occurred in the context of maintaining some features of judder invariant. For example, the crickets maintained their bodies so that they were horizontal relative to the substrate, not to gravity, and most features of the back and forward movement (e.g., distance moved, velocity) were maintained as fixed despite differences in posture and movement. At a theoretical level, what these findings suggest is that behavior patterns involve a combination of fixedness and variation in the service of that fixedness. It becomes an empirical issue to discern these complementary components.

David Gray|Senescence in field crickets (Orthoptera; Gryllidae): examining the effects of sex and a sex-biased parasitoid|David A Gray, William H Cade|2000/2/28|Canadian journal of zoology|78|1|140-143|NRC Research Press|The evolutionary theory of aging proposes that senescence is related to decreased selection against deleterious mutations acting late in life. Senescence, i.e., an increase in intrinsic mortality with age, should reflect levels of extrinsic mortality early in life. We tested these predictions using two species of field cricket, Gryllus integer and Gryllus pennsylvanicus. Gryllus integer males are host to a sex-biased parasitoid fly, which orients to the male calling song. As a result, males have reduced life expectancy compared with females in the field. In contrast, G. pennsylvanicus males and females appear to have similar life expectancies in the wild. Thus, we predicted that there would be a significant species × sex interaction, with G. integer males having the shortest life-span. In two replicates, we found that males of both species died at a significantly younger age than females. However, no evidence of a species × sex … 
David Gray|Divergence in male cricket song and female preference functions in three allopatric sister species|Ralf Matthias Hennig, Thomas Blankers, David A Gray|2016/5/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology A|202|5|347-360|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Multivariate female preference functions for male sexual signals have rarely been investigated, especially in a comparative context among sister species. Here we examined male signal and female preference co-variation in three closely related, but allopatric species of Gryllus crickets and quantified male song traits as well as female preferences. We show that males differ conspicuously in either one of two relatively static song traits, carrier frequency or pulse rate; female preference functions for these traits also differed, and would in combination enhance species discrimination. In contrast, the relatively dynamic song traits, chirp rate and chirp duty cycle, show minimal divergence among species and relatively greater conservation of female preference functions. Notably, among species we demonstrate similar mechanistic rules for the integration of pulse and chirp time scales, despite divergence in pulse … 
David Gray|Individual consistency, learning and memory in a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea|Jennifer Paur, David A Gray|2011/10/1|Animal behaviour|82|4|825-830|Academic Press|Search images are expected to be important components of predator and parasitoid search strategies as they reduce the search time for prey and hosts. Fixed search images, however, may constrain predators and parasitoids, and render them ineffective at switching to new more abundant prey or hosts. For switching behaviour to be effective, parasitoids need to be able to learn cues associated with abundant hosts, and they need to be able to extinguish preferences for the cues of hosts that are no longer abundant. Here we use the Gryllus cricket and Ormia ochracea parasitoid fly system to show (1) individual consistency in fly preference for song in the field, (2) learning of host song in the laboratory and (3) that the flies’ memory for learned host cues is very short term. These results are interesting and novel in several respects. First, our demonstration that O. ochracea satisfies each of the characteristics of an … 
David Gray|Correlated-response-to-selection experiments designed to test for a genetic correlation between female preferences and male traits yield biased results|David A Gray, William H Cade|1999/12/1||58|6|1325-1327|Academic Press|The genetic correlation between mating preferences and sexually selected (epigamic) traits is a central issue in both Fisherian and good genes models of mate choice (Fisher 1930; O’Donald 1980; Lande 1981; Pomiankowski 1988). One method of demonstrating the existence of a genetic correlation is to select on one trait, and observe if a second trait shows a correlated response to selection (Lande & Arnold 1983; Falconer 1989). This has become the most commonly adopted method of testing for a genetic correlation between mating preferences and epigamic traits: eight of 12 studies reviewed by Bakker & Pomiankowski (1995) used this method. In this commentary, we extend and clarify methodological issues first raised by Butlin (1993), and argue that correlated-response (CR) methods will overestimate the genetic correlation, and may even incorrectly identify a genetic correlation when none in fact exists. The … 
David Gray|Molecular divergence between Gryllus rubens and Gryllus texensis, sister species of field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)|David A Gray, P Barnfield, M Seifried, MH Richards|2006/6|The Canadian Entomologist|138|3|305-313|Cambridge University Press|We assess the degree of sequence divergence in the maternally inherited mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (CytB) genes between two sister species of field crickets, Gryllus rubens Scudder, 1902 and Gryllus texensis Cade and Otte, 2000. We analyzed 1460 base pairs from 10 individuals of each species; individuals were sampled from areas of both allopatry and sympatry. Overall average pairwise mitochondrial sequence divergence between species was 1.4% ± 0.1% (mean ± SD); however, there was almost an order of magnitude more divergence in COI (2.59% ± 2.25%) than in CytB (0.35% ± 0.24%). Gryllus texensis appears to harbor a much greater level of genetic variation than does G. rubens. Phylogenetic trees constructed from these sequences show reasonable separation of species; however, sequences are not reciprocally monophyletic. Gene tree polyphyly may reflect … 
David Gray|Multivariate female preference tests reveal latent perceptual biases|DA Gray, E Gabel, T Blankers, RM Hennig|2016/11/16|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|283|1842|20161972|The Royal Society|The question of why males of many species produce elaborate mating displays has now been largely resolved: females prefer to mate with males that produce such displays. However, the question of why females prefer such displays has been controversial, with an emerging consensus that such displays often provide information to females about the direct fitness benefits that males provide to females and/or the indirect fitness benefits provided to offspring. Alternative explanations, such as production of arbitrarily attractive sons or innate pre-existing female sensory or perceptual bias, have also received support in certain taxa. Here, we describe multivariate female preference functions for male acoustic traits in two chirping species of field crickets with slow pulse rates; our data reveal cryptic female preferences for long trills that have not previously been observed in other chirping species. The trill preferences are … 
David Gray|Species divergence in field crickets: genetics, song, ecomorphology, and pre-and postzygotic isolation|David A Gray, Nicholas J Gutierrez, Tom L Chen, Christopher Gonzalez, David B Weissman, Jeffrey A Cole|2016/1/14|Biological journal of the Linnean Society|117|2|192-205|Oxford University Press|Studies that simultaneously estimate levels of species divergence in genetics, reproductive and ecological traits, and pre- and postzygotic isolation are relatively rare. Here we compare levels of divergence in three allopatric sister species of field crickets. We compare divergence in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, male song, female ovipositor length, levels of pre- and postzygotic isolation, and male versus female contributions to prezygotic isolation. Taken together, our data show the accumulation of a multitude of potential reproductive isolating barriers if secondary contact were to become established. Furthermore, ecological and behavioural prezygotic isolation appear significantly more advanced than postzygotic isolation, with prezygotic isolation due to female behaviour exceeding that due to male behaviour. 
David Gray|Mating Behavior and Dual‐Purpose Armaments in a Camel Cricket|Estenia L Haley, David A Gray|2012/1|Ethology|118|1|49-56|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Sexual selection has often been dichotomized into intersexual and intrasexual components of selection, favoring ornaments and weapons, respectively. Here, we show that a weapon used in male–male combat is sometimes also used in a functionally similar manner for grasping females during mating. The hind legs of adult males of some species of Pristoceuthophilus camel crickets have strongly bent tibia and stout femora with two large conspicuous spines. Here, we show that (1) leg armature is positively allometric, (2) males use these leg modifications when fighting other males, (3) males sometimes use the same leg modifications in the same functional manner for grabbing and holding females for mating, (4) virgin females show more interest in males than do non‐virgin females, and (5) males are more likely to use their leg modifications to grab and hold females when paired with non‐virgin females than … 
David Gray|Seasonal dynamics and overwintering strategy of the tachinid fly (Diptera: Tachinidae), Ormia ochracea (Bigot) in southern California|Jennifer Paur, David Gray|2011/1/1|Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|4|2|145-156|Brill|We present the first data on the seasonal abundance of an acoustically orienting parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea (Bigot), in southern California. Peak population abundance of the parasitoid lags peak population abundance of its primary local host species the field cricket Gryllus lineaticeps Stål, by about six weeks. We also examined pupal diapause as a potential overwintering mechanism. Taken together our results suggest (1) that O. ochracea lacks a highly effective pupal diapause, (2) that spring adult field cricket species are safe from the fly, and (3) that most of the late fall flies die without reproducing. 
David Gray|Multivariate Phenotypic Evolution: Divergent Acoustic Signals and Sexual Selection in Gryllus Field Crickets|Thomas Blankers, David A Gray, R Matthias Hennig|2017/3/1|Evolutionary Biology|44|1|43-55|Springer US|Predicting the response to selection is at the core of evolutionary biology. Presently, thorough understanding of the effects of selection on the multivariate phenotype is lacking, in particular for behavioral traits. Here, we compared multivariate acoustic mating signals among seven field cricket species contrasting two selection regimes: (1) species producing songs with long trains of pulses for which preference functions for acoustic energy (chirp duty cycle) are linear and likely exert strong directional selection (‘trillers’); (2) species producing songs consisting of short chirps and for which preference functions for chirp duty cycle are concave and directional selection is likely weak or absent (‘chirpers’). We compared the phenotypic variance–covariance matrix (P) among species and uncovered two main patterns: First, surprisingly, pulse rate and chirp rate were positively correlated in six of seven species thus … 
David Gray|Male armaments and reproductive behavior in “nutcracker” camel crickets (Rhaphidophoridae, Pristoceuthophilus)|Lauren Conroy, David Gray|2015/3|Insects|6|1|85-99|Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute|Males of many species possess striking weaponry used in intrasexual competition for access to females. Until recently, there were no known cases of male weaponry being used against females in sexual coercion. However, in the camel cricket, Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus, males use modified hind legs to fight with each other and also to trap females and force them to copulate. To determine whether hind leg armaments serve similar fighting and mating functions in morphologically similar congeners, we performed a comparative survey of armament use in intra-and inter-sexual interactions in four additional species of Pristoceuthophilus (P. arizonae and three undescribed species: P.‘Huachuca summer,’P.‘Madera’and P.‘Mt. Pinos’). Intrasexual leg fighting occurred in all species for which trials were performed, and hints of sexual coercion occurred in two species (P.‘Huachuca summer’and P.‘Mt. Pinos’), suggesting additional cases of a uniquely dual-purpose armament. These findings suggest an evolutionary exaptation of hind leg armaments in this genus, wherein an intrasexual fighting weapon took on a secondary function of sexual coercion. View Full-Text 
David Gray|Speciation, divergence, and the origin of Gryllus rubens: behavior, morphology, and molecules|David A Gray|2011/6||2|2|195-209|Molecular Diversity Preservation International|The last 25 years or so has seen a huge resurgence of interest in speciation research. This has coincided with the development and widespread use of new tools in molecular genetics, especially DNA sequencing, to inform ecological and evolutionary questions. Here I review about a decade of work on the sister species of field crickets Gryllus texensis and G. rubens. This work has included analysis of morphology, behavior, and the mitochondrial DNA molecule. The molecular work in particular has dramatically re-shaped my interpretation of the speciational history of these taxa, suggesting that rather than ‘sister’species we should consider these taxa as ‘mother-daughter’species with G. rubens derived from within a subset of ancestral G. texensis.

Though largely subterranean, adults of some species, such as Scapteriscus borellii Giglio-Tos 1894, are capable of long dispersive flights and phonotaxis to male calling songs to find suitable habitats and mates. Mole crickets in the genus Scapteriscus are known to be attracted to and can be caught by audio lure traps that broadcast synthesized or recorded calling songs. We report improvements in the design and production of electronic controllers for the automation of semipermanent mole cricket trap lures as well as highly portable audio trap collection designs. Using these improved audio lure traps, we collected the first reported individuals of the pest mole cricket S. borellii in California. We describe several characteristic features of the calling song of … 
David Gray|Abdominal tubercles of adult male camel crickets, Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae), produce cues attractive to females|Estenia Lisseth Haley, David A Gray|2013/11/1|Journal of insect behavior|26|6|804-811|Springer US|In contrast to many crickets and katydids, adult male camel crickets (Orthoptera: Raphidophoridae) do not stridulate and do not produce audible air-borne calling songs to attract females for mating. The mating behavior of most camel cricket species is undescribed; how pair-formation occurs is unknown, but chemical cues seem one likely possibility. In the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus Rehn, we test (1) the role of chemical cues in conspecific attraction, and (2) the role of the abdominal tubercles of adult males in producing those cues. We show (1) that virgin adult females are attracted to paper towels previously exposed to adult males, and (2) that paper towels previously exposed to adult males with exposed tubercles are more attractive than paper towels previously exposed to adult males with experimentally closed tubercles. In addition, we present Scanning Electron Microscope photos of … 
David Gray|Sexual selection, phenotypic and genetic quality in house crickets, Acheta domesticus.|David Andrew Gray|1998||||5235-5235||Degree: Ph. D. DegreeYear: 1997 Institute: The University of New Mexico Adviser: A. Kodric-Brown. Sexual selection in House crickets, Acheta domesticus, was investigated. Male chirps attract females for mating. The number of pulses per chirp was related to male size. Females preferred chirps with more pulses per chirp. Thus female phonotaxis was biased toward larger males. The female bias in phonotaxis was expressed in younger but not older females. Females choosing the larger males''chirp spent more time in mate selection than females which chose the smaller males''chirp. Male body size was found to be heritable. The heritability of size was higher under benign nutritional conditions than under stressful nutritional conditions. As compared to smaller males, larger males developed more quickly, and produced larger but not more numerous spermatophores. Larger females had higher fecundity than smaller … 
David Gray|Forced copulation as a conditional alternative strategy in camel crickets|Lauren P Conroy, David A Gray|2014/9/1|Behavioral ecology and sociobiology|68|9|1431-1439|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|In the animal kingdom, males typically acquire reproductive access to females through courtship, nuptial gifts, or combat. In many species, small or poor-condition males that are unable to produce an attractive display, proffer an adequate mating gift, or dominate in male–male competition may resort to forced copulation. Forced copulation has been previously demonstrated in the camel cricket Pristoceuthophilus marmoratus and is uniquely facilitated by male hind leg weaponry that functions in both intrasexual competition and sexual coercion. Because male leg armaments are positively allometric, the largest males would seem best equipped to force-copulate, although they might be the most attractive to females, and so least likely to adopt a forced copulation strategy. In order to resolve this potential paradox and determine which males are in fact most likely to force-copulate, we manipulated male body … 
David Gray|Induced expression of a vestigial sexual signal|David A Gray, Scherezade Hormozi, Fritz R Libby, Randy W Cohen|2018/5/16|Biology letters|14|5|20180095|The Royal Society|Vestigial morphological traits are common and well known in a variety of taxa. Identification of vestigial genes has illustrated the potential for evolutionary reversals and the re-expression of atavistic traits. Here we induce expression of a behavioural sexual signal, male calling song, in a cricket species, Gryllus ovisopis, which lacks a functional calling song. We successfully used acetylcholine injections in the frontal space of the head of male crickets to activate cerebral command neurons for cricket calling, and we recorded calling songs with a temporal chirp pattern similar to that of G. ovisopis' close evolutionary relatives, G. firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, implying that the neural pattern generators that underlie cricket calling behaviour persist in a vestigial state in G. ovisopis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the induced expression of a vestigial behaviour in any organism. The retention of latent …

Here, we assess transcriptomic variation to unravel the evolutionary history of Gryllus rubens and Gryllus texensis, cryptic field cricket species with highly divergent mating behavior. We infer their demographic history and screen their transcriptomes for footprints of selection in the context of the inferred demography. We find strong support for a long history of bidirectional gene flow, which ceased during the late Pleistocene, and a bottleneck in G. rubens consistent with a peripatric origin of this species. Importantly, the demographic history has likely strongly shaped patterns of genetic differentiation (empirical FST distribution). Concordantly, FST‐based selection detection uncovers a large number of outliers, likely comprising many false positives, echoing recent … 
David Gray|How females of chirping and trilling field crickets integrate the ‘what’and ‘where’of male acoustic signals during decision making|Eileen Gabel, David A Gray, R Matthias Hennig|2016/11/1|Journal of Comparative Physiology A|202|11|823-837|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|In crickets acoustic communication serves mate selection. Female crickets have to perceive and integrate male cues relevant for mate choice while confronted with several different signals in an acoustically diverse background. Overall female decisions are based on the attractiveness of the temporal pattern (informative about the ‘what’) and on signal intensity (informative about the ‘where’) of male calling songs. Here, we investigated how the relevant cues for mate choice are integrated during the decision process by females of five different species of chirping and trilling field crickets. Using a behavioral design, female preferences in no-choice and choice situations for male calling songs differing in pulse rate, modulation depth, intensities, chirp/trill arrangements and temporal shifts were examined. Sensory processing underlying decisions in female field crickets is rather similar as combined evidence …

David Gray|Call recognition and female choice in a treefrog with a multicomponent call|Mark V Oliva, Kristine Kaiser, Jeanne M Robertson, David A Gray|2018/5|Ethology|124|5|331-337||Acoustic mating signals are typically species‐specific, and often additionally are subject to directional female preferences. Male executioner treefrogs, Dendropsophus carnifex, produce a multicomponent advertisement call composed of an introductory screech note followed by two or more click notes. Here, we tested (i) call recognition by comparing female directed phonotaxis towards individual and combined call components: screech vs. clicks vs. screech + clicks, (ii) female preferences for greater numbers of click notes and (iii) female preferences for faster call rates. The results demonstrated that screeches and clicks, presented either separately or together as a complete call, evoke similar female responses, suggesting that either note was sufficient to elicit a mate‐recognition response. Additionally, females preferred calls with greater numbers of click notes and with faster call rates. We interpret these results … 
David Gray|Observations of the acoustic behavior of Hoplosphyrum boreale (Scudder): a common scaly cricket of Southern California|Jonelle Saidy, David A Gray|2004/4/1|Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences|103|1|34-44|Southern California Academy of Sciences|We describe observations of the acoustic behavior of the scaly cricket Hoplosphyrum boreale (Scudder), a common scaly-cricket (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Mogoplistinae) of southern California and the desert southwest. The long-range calling song used by males to attract females from a distance is compared to song produced in close-range courtship interactions between males and females. We also describe preliminary observations of mating behavior, and the song of a sympatric undescribed species.********** In comparison to field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Gryllinae), ground crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Nemobiinae), and tree crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae: Oecanthinae), the acoustics and behavior of scaly crickets have received little attention. Scaly crickets are so named because small'scales' cover nearly the entire body surface (Love & Walker 1979; Yang & Yen 2001). Although there are approximately …

Using real-time intravital imaging of human tumor cells transplanted into transparent zebrafish, we show here that extravasation of cancer cells is a highly dynamic process that involves the modulation of tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium and intravascular cell migration along the luminal surface of the vascular wall. Tumor cells do not damage or induce vascular leak at the site of extravasation, but rather induce local vessel remodeling characterized by clustering of endothelial cells and cell-cell junctions. Intravascular locomotion of tumor cells is independent of the direction of blood flow and requires β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to the blood-vessel wall. Interestingly, the expression of the pro-metastatic gene Twist in tumor cells increases their intravascular migration and … 
Jonathan Kelber|GRP78 and Cripto form a complex at the cell surface and collaborate to inhibit transforming growth factor β signaling and enhance cell growth|Gidi Shani, Wolfgang H Fischer, Nicholas J Justice, Jonathan A Kelber, Wylie Vale, Peter C Gray|2008/1/15|Molecular and cellular biology|28|2|666-677|American Society for Microbiology Journals|Cripto is a multifunctional cell surface protein with important roles in vertebrate embryogenesis and the progression of human tumors. While Cripto has been shown to modulate multiple signaling pathways, its binding partners do not appear to fully explain its molecular actions. Therefore, we conducted a screen aimed at identifying novel Cripto-interacting proteins. This screen led to our identification of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is also expressed at the surfaces of tumor cells. Here we demonstrate that Cripto and GRP78 interact at the cell surfaces of multiple cell lines and that their interaction is independent of prior association within the ER. Interestingly, short hairpin RNA knockdown of endogenous GRP78 resulted in enhanced transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, indicating that like Cripto, GRP78 inhibits this pathway. We further show that …

However, the molecular basis for Cripto coupling to these pathways during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis is not fully understood. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that Cripto forms a cell surface complex with the HSP70 family member glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78). Here, we provide novel functional evidence demonstrating that cell surface GRP78 is a necessary mediator of Cripto signaling in human tumor, mammary epithelial and embryonic stem cells. We show that targeted disruption of the cell surface Cripto/GRP78 complex using shRNAs or GRP78 immunoneutralization precludes Cripto activation of MAPK/PI3K pathways and modulation of activin-A, activin-B, Nodal and transforming …

Cancer patients with brain metastases display poor prognosis and survival due to the lack of effective therapeutics and treatment strategies. Recent work using intravital microscopy and preclinical animal models indicates that metastatic cells colonize the brain, specifically in close contact with the existing brain vasculature. However, it is not known how contact with the vascular niche promotes microtumor formation. Here, we investigate the role of connexins in mediating early events in brain colonization using transparent zebrafish and chicken embryo models of brain metastasis. We provide evidence that breast cancer and melanoma cells utilize connexin gap junction proteins (Cx43, Cx26) to initiate brain metastatic lesion formation in association with the vasculature.

Jonathan Kelber|Cripto binds transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and inhibits TGF-β signaling|Peter C Gray, Gidi Shani, Kevin Aung, Jonathan Kelber, Wylie Vale|2006/12/15|Molecular and cellular biology|26|24|9268-9278|American Society for Microbiology Journals|Cripto is a developmental oncoprotein and a member of the epidermal growth factor-Cripto, FRL-1, Cryptic family of extracellular signaling molecules. In addition to having essential functions during embryogenesis, Cripto is highly expressed in tumors and promotes tumorigenesis. During development, Cripto acts as an obligate coreceptor for transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands, including nodals, growth and differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), and GDF3. As an oncogene, Cripto is thought to promote tumor growth via mechanisms including activation of mitogenic signaling pathways and antagonism of activin signaling. Here, we provide evidence supporting a novel mechanism in which Cripto inhibits the tumor suppressor function of TGF-β. Cripto bound TGF-β and reduced the association of TGF-β with its type I receptor, TβRI. Consistent with its ability to block receptor assembly, Cripto suppressed TGF-β …

Here, we report that the novel tyrosine kinase PEAK1 is upregulated in human malignancies, including human PDACs and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Oncogenic KRas induced a PEAK1-dependent kinase amplification loop between Src, PEAK1, and ErbB2 to drive PDAC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Surprisingly, blockade of ErbB2 expression increased Src-dependent PEAK1 expression, PEAK1-dependent Src activation, and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting a mechanism for the observed resistance of patients with PDACs to therapeutic intervention. Importantly, PEAK1 inactivation sensitized PDAC cells to trastuzumab and gemcitabine therapy. Our findings, therefore, suggest that PEAK1 is a novel biomarker … 
Jonathan Kelber|Cancer cell migration within 3D layer-by-layer microfabricated photocrosslinked PEG scaffolds with tunable stiffness|Pranav Soman, Jonathan A Kelber, Jin Woo Lee, Tracy N Wright, Kenneth S Vecchio, Richard L Klemke, Shaochen Chen|2012/10/1|Biomaterials|33|29|7064-7070|Elsevier|Our current understanding of 3-dimensional (3D) cell migration is primarily based on results from fibrous scaffolds with randomly organized internal architecture. Manipulations that change the stiffness of these 3D scaffolds often alter other matrix parameters that can modulate cell motility independently or synergistically, making observations less predictive of how cells behave when migrating in 3D. In order to decouple microstructural influences and stiffness effects, we have designed and fabricated 3D polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds that permit orthogonal tuning of both elastic moduli and microstructure. Scaffolds with log-pile architectures were used to compare the 3D migration properties of normal breast epithelial cells (HMLE) and Twist-transformed cells (HMLET). Our results indicate that the nature of cell migration is significantly impacted by the ability of cells to migrate in the third dimension. 2D ECM …

Here, we report the discovery of a cytoskeleton-associated kinase, pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1). PEAK1 is a 190-kDa nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that localizes to actin filaments and focal adhesions. PEAK1 undergoes Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, regulates the p130Cas-Crk-paxillin and Erk signaling pathways, and operates downstream of integrin and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) to control cell spreading, migration, and proliferation. Perturbation of PEAK1 levels in cancer cells alters anchorage-independent growth and tumor progression in mice. Notably, primary and metastatic samples from colon cancer patients display amplified PEAK1 levels in 81% of the cases. Our findings indicate that PEAK1 is an important cytoskeletal regulatory kinase and possible target … 
Jonathan Kelber|Cripto is a noncompetitive activin antagonist that forms analogous signaling complexes with activin and nodal|Jonathan A Kelber, Gidi Shani, Evan C Booker, Wylie W Vale, Peter C Gray|2008/2/22|Journal of Biological Chemistry|283|8|4490-4500|American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|Cripto plays critical roles during embryogenesis and has been implicated in promoting the growth and spread of tumors. Cripto is required for signaling by certain transforming growth factor-β superfamily members, such as Nodal, but also antagonizes others, such as activin. The opposing effects of Cripto on Nodal and activin signaling seem contradictory, however, because these closely related ligands utilize the same type I (ALK4) and type II (ActRII/IIB) receptors. Here, we have addressed this apparent paradox by demonstrating that Cripto forms analogous receptor complexes with Nodal and activin and functions as a noncompetitive activin antagonist. Our results show that activin-A and Nodal elicit similar maximal signaling responses in the presence of Cripto that are substantially lower than that of activin-A in the absence of Cripto.

Here, we investigated how eIF5A proteins regulate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pathogenesis. eIF5A proteins are the only known proteins regulated by a distinct posttranslational modification termed hypusination, which is catalyzed by two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). The highly selective nature of the hypusine modification and its amenability to pharmacologic inhibition make eIF5A proteins attractive therapeutic targets. We found that the expression and hypusination of eIF5A proteins are upregulated in …

Here, we identify CRIPTO and its cell-surface receptor GRP78 as regulators of stem cell behavior in isolated fetal and adult mammary epithelial cells. We develop a CRIPTO antagonist that promotes differentiation and reduces self-renewal of mammary stem cell-enriched populations cultured ex vivo. By contrast, CRIPTO treatment maintains the stem cell phenotype in these cultures and yields colonies with enhanced mammary gland reconstitution capacity. Surface expression of GRP78 marks CRIPTO-responsive, stem cell-enriched fetal and adult mammary epithelial cells, and deletion of GRP78 from adult mammary epithelial cells blocks their mammary gland reconstitution potential. Together, these findings identify the CRIPTO/GRP78 pathway as a developmentally conserved regulator of fetal and adult mammary … 
Jonathan Kelber|Designer TGFβ superfamily ligands with diversified functionality|George P Allendorph, Jessica D Read, Yasuhiko Kawakami, Jonathan A Kelber, Michael J Isaacs, Senyon Choe|2011/11/4|PLoS One|6|11|e26402|Public Library of Science|Transforming Growth Factor – beta (TGFβ) superfamily ligands, including Activins, Growth and Differentiation Factors (GDFs), and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), are excellent targets for protein-based therapeutics because of their pervasiveness in numerous developmental and cellular processes. We developed a strategy termed RASCH (Random Assembly of Segmental Chimera and Heteromer), to engineer chemically-refoldable TGFβ superfamily ligands with unique signaling properties. One of these engineered ligands, AB208, created from Activin-βA and BMP-2 sequences, exhibits the refolding characteristics of BMP-2 while possessing Activin-like signaling attributes. Further, we find several additional ligands, AB204, AB211, and AB215, which initiate the intracellular Smad1-mediated signaling pathways more strongly than BMP-2 but show no sensitivity to the natural BMP antagonist Noggin unlike natural BMP-2. In another design, incorporation of a short N-terminal segment from BMP-2 was sufficient to enable chemical refolding of BMP-9, without which was never produced nor refolded. Our studies show that the RASCH strategy enables us to expand the functional repertoire of TGFβ superfamily ligands through development of novel chimeric TGFβ ligands with diverse biological and clinical values. 
Jonathan Kelber|Identification of a PEAK1/ZEB1 signaling axis during TGFβ/fibronectin-induced EMT in breast cancer|M Agajanian, F Runa, JA Kelber|2015|BBRC|||||Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) is the archetypal member of the TGFβ superfamily of ligands and has pleiotropic functions during normal development, adult tissue homeostasis and pathophysiological processes such as cancer. In epithelial cancers TGFβ signaling can either suppress tumor growth or promote metastasis via the induction of a well-characterized epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. We recently reported that PEAK1 kinase mediates signaling cross talk between TGFβ receptors and integrin/Src/MAPK pathways and functions as a critical molecular regulator of TGFβ-induced breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, EMT and metastasis. Here, we examined the breast cancer cell contexts in which TGFβ induces both EMT and PEAK1, and discovered this event to be unique to oncogene-transformed mammary epithelial cells and triple-negative breast cancer cells. Using the … 
Jonathan Kelber|PEAK1 Acts as a Molecular Switch to Regulate Context-Dependent TGFβ Responses in Breast Cancer|M Agajanian, A Campeau, M Hoover, A Hou, D Brambilla, SL Kim, RL Klemke, JA Kelber|2015/8/12|PLoS ONE|10|8|||Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) has dual functions as both a tumor suppressor and a promoter of cancer progression within the tumor microenvironment, but the molecular mechanisms by which TGFβ signaling switches between these outcomes and the contexts in which this switch occurs remain to be fully elucidated. We previously identified PEAK1 as a new non-receptor tyrosine kinase that associates with the cytoskeleton, and facilitates signaling of HER2/Src complexes. We also showed PEAK1 functions downstream of KRas to promote tumor growth, metastasis and therapy resistance using preclinical in vivo models of human tumor progression. In the current study, we analyzed PEAK1 expression in human breast cancer samples and found PEAK1 levels correlate with mesenchymal gene expression, poor cellular differentiation and disease relapse. At the cellular level, we also observed that PEAK1 expression was highest in mesenchymal breast cancer cells, correlated with migration potential and increased in response to TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Thus, we sought to evaluate the role of PEAK1 in the switching of TGFβ from a tumor suppressing to tumor promoting factor. Notably, we discovered that high PEAK1 expression causes TGFβ to lose its anti-proliferative effects, and potentiates TGFβ-induced proliferation, EMT, cell migration and tumor metastasis in a fibronectin-dependent fashion. In the presence of fibronectin, PEAK1 caused a switching of TGFβ signaling from its canonical Smad2/3 pathway to non-canonical Src and MAPK signaling. This report is the first to provide evidence that PEAK1 …

Although eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling contributes to multiple aggressive cancer cell phenotypes, the downstream signaling processes that mediate these responses are uncharacterized. Through proteomics and informatic analyses of PEAK1-depleted PDAC cells, we defined protein translation, cytoskeleton organization, and cell-cycle regulatory pathways as major pathways controlled by PEAK1. Biochemical and functional studies revealed that the transcription factors YAP1 and TAZ are key targets of eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling. YAP1/TAZ coimmunoprecipitated with PEAK1. Interfering with eIF5A-PEAK1 signaling in PDAC cells inhibited YAP/TAZ protein expression … 
Jonathan Kelber|PEAK1, a novel kinase target in the fight against cancer|Jonathan A Kelber, Richard L Klemke|2010/7|Oncotarget|1|3|219|Impact Journals, LLC|The completion of the human genome has enabled the identification of almost all protein kinase genes (approximately 518 total). While this number is less than originally predicted [1], it constitutes almost 2% of the entire human genome [2]. Because kinases are integral to almost all signaling processes in eukaryotic cells via their role as posttranslational modifiers, it is crucial to identify and characterize their molecular and functional properties in order to more fully understand human physiology and disease. For example, kinases play central roles in cellular processes ranging from cell-cycle progression to cell motility to cell differentiation, and their proper function controls development and homeostasis in the adult [3-8]. Additionally, dysregulation of kinase genes accounts for the origin of many human diseases, making them an important family of genes to comprehensively understand-possibly leading to novel …

Here, we report that high expression of CRIPTO correlates with poor survival in stratified risk groups of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. CRIPTO and its signaling partner glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) are highly expressed in PCa metastases and display higher levels in the metastatic ALDH high sub-population of PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells compared with non-metastatic ALDH low. Coculture of the osteotropic PC-3M-Pro4Luc2 PCa cells with differentiated primary human osteoblasts induced CRIPTO and GRP78 expression in cancer cells and increases the size of the ALDH high sub-population. Additionally, CRIPTO or GRP78 knockdown decreases proliferation, migration, clonogenicity and the size of the metastasis-initiating ALDH high sub-population. CRIPTO knockdown reduces the invasion of …

Katz, Jason Fleming, Robert M. Hoffman, Michael Bouvet, Robert Doebler, Jonathan A. Kelber|2016|Oncotarget||||Impact Journals|Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify and validate new biomarkers of cancer onset, progression and therapy resistance. Substantial archives of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples from patients represent a rich resource for linking molecular signatures to clinical data. However, performing NGS on FFPE samples is limited by poor RNA purification methods. To address this hurdle, we developed an improved methodology for extracting high-quality RNA from FFPE samples. By briefly integrating a newly-designed micro-homogenizing (mH) tool with commercially available FFPE RNA extraction protocols, RNA recovery is increased by approximately 3-fold while maintaining standard A260/A280 ratios and RNA quality index (RQI) values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mH-purified FFPE RNAs are longer and of higher integrity. Previous studies have suggested that pancreatic …

Kelber Armen Gharibi, Sa La Kim, Justin Molnar, Daniel Brambilla, Yvess Adamian, Malachia Hoover, Julie Hong, Joy Lin, Laurelin Wolfenden|2017/8/30|Scientific Reports||||Nature|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has single-digit 5-year survival rates at< 7%. There is a dire need to improve pre-malignant detection methods and identify new therapeutic targets for abrogating PDAC progression. To this end, we mined our previously published pseudopodium-enriched (PDE) protein/phosphoprotein datasets to identify novel PDAC-specific biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. We discovered that integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1) is frequently upregulated in pancreatic cancers and associated precursor lesions. Expression of ITGA1-specific collagens within the pancreatic cancer microenvironment significantly correlates with indicators of poor patient prognosis, and depleting ITGA1 from PDAC cells revealed that it is required for collagen-induced tumorigenic potential. Notably, collagen/ITGA1 signaling promotes the survival of ALDH1-positive stem-like cells and cooperates with TGFβ to drive …

Major components of the TME are immune cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Herein, we discuss the molecular and cellular heterogeneity within the TME and how this presents unique challenges and opportunities for treating breast and prostate cancers. 
Jonathan Kelber|Proteomic and biochemical methods to study the cytoskeletome|Richard L Klemke, Xinning Jiang, Sunkyu Choi, Jonathan A Kelber|2013||||203-218|Humana Press, Totowa, NJ|The cytoskeleton is fundamental to many cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. It is composed of actin, microtubules, intermediate filaments, and integrin cell surface receptors, which form focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix. These elements are highly integrated in the cell providing a rigid network of interconnected cables and protein scaffolds, which generate force and mechanical support to maintain cell shape and movement. However, the cytoskeleton is not just a simple compilation of static filaments that dictate cell adhesion and morphology—it is highly plastic with the inherent ability to assemble and disassemble in response to diverse and complex cellular cues. Thus, biochemical and proteomic methods are needed to better understand the cytoskeleton network and its dynamic signal transduction functions in health and disease. This chapter … 
Jonathan Kelber|Ascending the PEAK1 toward targeting TGFβ during cancer progression: Recent advances and future perspectives|Farhana Runa, Yvess Adamian, Jonathan A Kelber|2016|Cancer cell & microenvironment|3|1||NIH Public Access|Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Mortality in patients with solid, epithelial-derived tumors strongly correlates with disease stage and the systemic metastatic load. In such cancers, notable morphological and molecular changes have been attributed to cells as they pass through a continuum of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states and many of these changes are essential for metastasis. While cancer metastasis is a complex cascade that is regulated by cell-autonomous and microenvironmental influences, it is well-accepted that understanding and controlling metastatic disease is a viable method for increasing patient survival. In the past 5 years, the novel non-receptor tyrosine kinase PEAK1 has surfaced as a central regulator of tumor progression and metastasis in the context of solid, epithelial cancers. Here, we review this literature with a special focus on our recent work …

However, it is also a dynamic signaling scaffold that receives and transmits complex mechanosensing stimuli that regulate normal physiological and aberrant pathophysiological processes. Studying cytoskeletal functions in the cytoskeleton’s native state is inherently difficult due to its rigid and insoluble nature. This has severely limited detailed proteomic analyses of the complex protein networks that regulate the cytoskeleton. Here, we describe a purification method that enriches for the cytoskeleton and its associated proteins in their native state that is also compatible with current mass spectrometry-based protein detection methods. This method can be used for biochemical, fluorescence, and large-scale proteomic analyses of numerous cell types. Using this approach … 
Jonathan Kelber|The Actin Cytoskeleton|Jonathan A Kelber, Richard L Klemke|2011/5/18|Cellular Domains|||197|John Wiley & Sons|Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in the cell and is critical for survival of all organisms. It is necessary for many fundamental cellular processes including cell migration, axon pathfinding, differentiation, and proliferation (Richards and Cavalier-Smith 2005). On the other hand, improper regulation of actin contributes to numerous human diseases including developmental disorders, inflammation, and cancer (Richards and Cavalier-Smith 2005). Actin is a highly abundant protein in cells and is highly conserved throughout all eukaryotes (Erickson 2007). F-actin is composed of individual β-actin and γ-actin subunits polymerized into helical double-stranded filaments that are bundled into fibrous networks of cables to provide mechanical support, force generation, and transport of intracellular cargo. The F-actin cytoskeleton can be grouped into the following subcellular compartments: the membrane-associated cytoskeleton (including ruffles, filopodia, spikes, pseudopodia, and lamellapodia), the cortical actin rim, and internal stress fibers and cables (Pollard and Cooper 2009; Prasain and Stevens 2009; Fig. 12.1 A). The membrane cytoskeleton and stress fibers are made up of shorter F-actin structures, while the cortical actin rim is composed of long F-actin fibers bundled together (Heimann et al. 1999). The membrane actin cytoskeleton possesses a thickness of only a few nanometers and primarily regulates membrane architecture, allowing the cell membrane to adopt a dynamic nature. The cortical actin rim lies adjacent to and beneath the membrane actin cytoskeleton. This structure is composed of dense actin fibers and is modulated by …

Hamalian, Toni L. Uhlendorf, Lisa R. Banner, Jonathan A. Kelber|2019/4/30|Oncotarget|2019|10|3027-3039||Cancer metastasis is responsible for the clear majority of cancer-related deaths. Survival and expansion of cancer cells at secondary sites requires that these premetastatic microenvironments be primed by primary tumor cells and their secreted factors. Efforts to date have been limited by immune-deficient in vivo models and/or the need for finely-tuned analysis time points that reduce contributions from early-disseminating cancer cells. In this regard, we developed a tumor cell-free syngeneic breast cancer model for characterizing tumor cell secretome-mediated reprogramming of premetastatic tissues. We demonstrate that secretomes from metastatic breast cancer cells differentially regulate the lung and brain, promoting a tumor-supportive lung microenvironment with both elevated CD73 expression and decreased TNFα expression. Using in vitro models of CD73-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and …

We analyzed regulatory variation in a cross between laboratory and wild strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Clustering and linkage analysis defined groups of coregulated genes and the loci involved in their regulation. Most expression differences mapped to trans-acting loci. Positional cloning and functional assays showed that polymorphisms in GPA1 and AMN1 affect expression of genes involved in pheromone response and daughter cell separation, respectively. We also asked whether particular classes of genes were more likely to contain trans-regulatory polymorphisms. Notably, transcription factors showed no enrichment, and trans-regulatory variation seems to be broadly dispersed across classes of genes with different molecular functions.

The meeting was entitled “Terabase Metagenomics” and was sponsored by the Institute for Computing in Science (ICiS) summer 2010 workshop program. The aim of the workshop was to explore the fundamental questions relating to microbial ecology that could be addressed using advances in sequencing potential. Technological advances in next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina HiSeq 2000 can generate in excess of 250 billion base pairs of genetic information in 8 days. Thus, the generation of a trillion base pairs of genetic information is becoming a routine matter. The main outcome from this meeting was the birth of a concept and practical approach to exploring microbial life on earth, the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP). Here we briefly describe the highlights of this meeting and provide an overview of the EMP concept and how it can be applied to exploration of the microbiome of each ecosystem on this planet.

Taking into account the total mass of perennially frozen sediment (up to several hundred meters deep), permafrost contains a huge amount of buried, ancient organic carbon (Tarnocai et al., 2009). In addition, permafrost is warming rapidly in response to global climate change (Romanovsky et al., 2010), potentially leading to widespread thaw and a larger, seasonally thawed soil active layer. This concern has prompted the question: will permafrost thawing lead to the release of massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere? This question can only be answered by understanding how the microbes residing in permafrost will respond to thaw …

The alignments were checked and curated to make them specific to the targeted KO. Within this process, sequence profiles were enriched with the most abundant sequences available to maximize the yield of accurate classifier models. An associated functional ontology was built to describe the functional groups and hierarchy. FOAM allows the user to select the target search space before HMM-based comparison steps and to easily …

We resequenced all 57 variable (V) genes in the human T cell receptor alpha and delta (TRA/TRD) locus in 40 individuals of Northern European, Mexican, African-American and Chinese descent. Two hundred and eighty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The distribution of SNPs between V genes was heterogeneous, with an average of five SNPs per gene and a range of zero to 15. We describe the patterns of linkage disequilibrium for these newly discovered SNPs and compare these patterns with other emerging large-scale datasets (e.g. Perlegen and HapMap projects) to place our findings into a framework for future analysis of genotype–phenotype associations across this locus. Furthermore, we …

Viable life exists in permafrost tens of thousands of years old but we know little about the metabolic and physiological adaptations to the challenges presented by life in frozen ground over geologic time. In this study we asked whether increasing age and the associated stressors drive adaptive changes in community composition and function. We conducted deep metagenomic and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing across a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence from 19 000 to 33 000 years before present (kyr). We found that age markedly affected community composition and reduced diversity. Reconstruction of paleovegetation from metagenomic sequence suggests vegetation differences in the paleo record are not responsible for shifts in community …

Here we investigate the role of groundwater bacterial communities in the natural attenuation of DCM at an undisclosed manufacturing site in New Jersey. This study investigates the bacterial community structure of groundwater samples differentially contaminated with DCM to better understand the biodegradation potential of these autochthonous bacterial communities. Bacterial community analysis was completed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of groundwater samples (n= 26) with DCM contamination ranging from 0.89 to 9,800,000 µg/L. Significant DCM concentration-driven shifts in overall bacterial community structure were identified between samples, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes within the most contaminated samples. Across all samples, a total of 6,134 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, with 16 taxa having strong correlations with increased DCM concentration. Putative DCM degraders such as Pseudomonas, Dehalobacterium and Desulfovibrio were present within groundwater across all levels of DCM contamination. Interestingly, each of these taxa dominated specific DCM contamination ranges respectively. Potential DCM degrading lineages yet to be cited specifically as a DCM degrading organisms, such as the Desulfosporosinus, thrived within the most heavily contaminated groundwater samples. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed aerobic and anaerobic bacterial taxa …

Here we present a detailed study of trunk neural crest development in the bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum. Vital labeling with dioctadecyl tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) and in situ hybridization using cloned Sox8 and Sox9 probes demonstrated that trunk neural crest cells follow a pattern similar to the migratory paths already described in zebrafish and amphibians. We found shark trunk neural crest along the rostral side of the somites, the ventromedial pathway, the branchial arches, the gut, the sensory ganglia, and the nerves …

Rachel Mackelprang|Changes in the Active, Dead, and Dormant Microbial Community Structure Across a Pleistocene Permafrost Chronosequence|Alexander Burkert, Thomas A Douglas, Mark P Waldrop, Rachel Mackelprang|2019/4/1|Appl. Environ. Microbiol.|85|7|e02646-18|American Society for Microbiology|Permafrost hosts a community of microorganisms that survive and reproduce for millennia despite extreme environmental conditions, such as water stress, subzero temperatures, high salinity, and low nutrient availability. Many studies focused on permafrost microbial community composition use DNA-based methods, such as metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. However, these methods do not distinguish among active, dead, and dormant cells. This is of particular concern in ancient permafrost, where constant subzero temperatures preserve DNA from dead organisms and dormancy may be a common survival strategy. To circumvent this, we applied (i) LIVE/DEAD differential staining coupled with microscopy, (ii) endospore enrichment, and (iii) selective depletion of DNA from dead cells to permafrost microbial communities across a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence (19,000, 27,000, and 33,000 … 
Rachel Mackelprang|Frozen in Time? Metabolic Processes and Survival Strategies of Microbial Communities in Ancient Permafrost.|Rachel Mackelprang|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||One quarter of the earth's terrestrial surface is underlain by permafrost. Permafrost soils contain approximately 25-50% of the total global soil C pool, nearly double the atmospheric C reservoir. The C is largely protected from microbial decomposition by frozen conditions, but climate change is threating to induce large-scale permafrost thaw exposing it to degradation. The resulting production of globally significant quantities of greenhouse gasses (GHGs)---including CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O---is expected to result in a positive feedback loop thus amplifying the effects of global warming.

Using permafrost collected from a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence (19 ka to 33 ka), we hypothesized that increasing age and associated stressors drive adaptive changes in microbial community function and composition, and that functional changes in the metagenome would be related to changes in the chemistry of permafrost carbon (C). Examinations of water-soluble organic carbon (OC) by Fourier-transform ion-cyclotron-resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), quantification of total anions, and metagenomic sequencing were combined to better understand the relationships between microbial populations, the molecular-level composition of potentially bioavailable organic matter (OM), and age.

Microbial strategies for survival and carbon metabolism over geologic time in a Pleistocene permafrost chronosequence|R Mackelprang, TA Douglas, MP Waldrop|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Permafrost soils have received tremendous interest due to their importance as a global carbon store with the potential to be thawed over the coming centuries. Instead of being'frozen in time,'permafrost contains active microbes. Most metagenomic studies have focused on Holocene aged permafrost. Here, we target Pleistocene aged ice and carbon rich permafrost (Yedoma), which can differ in carbon content and stage of decay. Our aim was to understand how microbes in the permafrost transform organic matter over geologic time and to identify physiological and biochemical adaptations that enable long-term survival. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize microbial communities along a permafrost age gradient. Samples were collected from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) Permafrost Tunnel near Fox, AK, which penetrates a hillside providing access to permafrost …

Although neural crest and cancer EMTs are morphologically similar, little is known regarding conservation of their underlying molecular mechanisms. We report that Sip1, which is involved in cancer EMT, plays a critical role in promoting the neural crest cell transition to a mesenchymal state. Sip1 transcripts are expressed in premigratory/migrating crest cells. After Sip1 loss, the neural crest specifier gene FoxD3 was abnormally retained in the dorsal neuroepithelium, whereas Sox10, which is normally required for emigration, was diminished. Subsequently, clumps of adherent neural crest cells remained adjacent to the neural tube and aberrantly expressed E-cadherin while lacking N-cadherin. These findings …

SoxB1 genes are down-regulated as cells exit the cell-cycle to differentiate and are considered functionally redundant in maintaining neural precursor populations. However, little is known about Sox3 function and its mode of action during primary neurogenesis. Using gain and loss-of-function studies, we analyzed Sox3 function in detail in Xenopus early neural development and compared it to that of Sox2. Through these studies we identified the first targets of a SoxB1 protein during primary neurogenesis. Sox3 functions as an activator to induce expression of the early neural genes, sox2 and geminin in the absence of protein synthesis and to indirectly inhibit the Bmp target Xvent2. As a result, Sox3 increases cell proliferation …

Studies in Xenopus demonstrate that inhibition of BMP results in the formation of neural tissue. However, the molecular mechanism driving the expression of early neural genes in response to this inhibition is unknown. Moreover, controversy remains regarding the sufficiency of BMP inhibition for neural induction. To address these questions, we performed a detailed analysis of the regulation of the soxB1 gene, sox3, one of the earliest genes expressed in the neuroectoderm. Using ectodermal explant assays, we analyzed the role of BMP, Wnt and FGF signaling in the regulation of sox3 and the closely related soxB1 gene, sox2. Our results demonstrate that both sox3 and sox2 are induced in response to BMP antagonism, but by distinct mechanisms and that the activation of both genes is independent of FGF signaling … 
Crystal Rogers|Neural crest specification: tissues, signals, and transcription factors|CD Rogers, CS Jayasena, S Nie, Marianne E Bronner|2012/1|Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology|1|1|52-68|John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|The neural crest is a transient population of multipotent and migratory cells unique to vertebrate embryos. Initially derived from the borders of the neural plate, these cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition to leave the central nervous system, migrate extensively in the periphery, and differentiate into numerous diverse derivatives. These include but are not limited to craniofacial cartilage, pigment cells, and peripheral neurons and glia. Attractive for their similarities to stem cells and metastatic cancer cells, neural crest cells are a popular model system for studying cell/tissue interactions and signaling factors that influence cell fate decisions and lineage transitions. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms required for neural crest formation in various vertebrate species, focusing on the importance of signaling factors from adjacent tissues and conserved gene regulatory interactions, which are required for … 
Crystal Rogers|The response of early neural genes to FGF signaling or inhibition of BMP indicate the absence of a conserved neural induction module|Crystal D Rogers, George S Ferzli, Elena S Casey|2011/12|BMC developmental biology|11|1|74|BioMed Central|The molecular mechanism that initiates the formation of the vertebrate central nervous system has long been debated. Studies in Xenopus and mouse demonstrate that inhibition of BMP signaling is sufficient to induce neural tissue in explants or ES cells respectively, whereas studies in chick argue that instructive FGF signaling is also required for the expression of neural genes. Although additional signals may be involved in neural induction and patterning, here we focus on the roles of BMP inhibition and FGF8a. To address the question of necessity and sufficiency of BMP inhibition and FGF signaling, we compared the temporal expression of the five earliest genes expressed in the neuroectoderm and determined their requirements for induction at the onset of neural plate formation in Xenopus. Our results demonstrate that the onset and peak of expression of the genes vary and that they have different regulatory requirements and are therefore unlikely to share a conserved neural induction regulatory module. Even though all require inhibition of BMP for expression, some also require FGF signaling; expression of the early-onset pan-neural genes sox2 and foxd5α requires FGF signaling while other early genes, sox3, geminin and zicr1 are induced by BMP inhibition alone. We demonstrate that BMP inhibition and FGF signaling induce neural genes independently of each other. Together our data indicate that although the spatiotemporal expression patterns of early neural genes are similar, the mechanisms involved in their expression are distinct and there are different signaling requirements for the expression of each gene.

At early stages, Elk3 is expressed in the head folds, head mesenchyme, intersomitic vessels, and migratory cranial neural crest (NC) cells. Loss of the Elk3 protein results in the retention of Pax7+ precursors in the dorsal neural tube that fail to upregulate neural crest specifier genes, FoxD3, Sox10 and Snail2, resulting in embryos with severe migration defects.

Crystal Rogers|Specifying neural crest cells: From chromatin to morphogens and factors in between|Crystal D Rogers, Shuyi Nie|2018/9|Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology|7|5|e322|John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|Neural crest (NC) cells are a stem‐like multipotent population of progenitor cells that are present in vertebrate embryos, traveling to various regions in the developing organism. Known as the “fourth germ layer,” these cells originate in the ectoderm between the neural plate (NP), which will become the brain and spinal cord, and nonneural tissues that will become the skin and the sensory organs. NC cells can differentiate into more than 30 different derivatives in response to the appropriate signals including, but not limited to, craniofacial bone and cartilage, sensory nerves and ganglia, pigment cells, and connective tissue. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the induction and specification of NC cells include epigenetic control, multiple interactive and redundant transcriptional pathways, secreted signaling molecules, and adhesion molecules. NC cells are important not only because they transform …

To clarify independent or coordinate function during development, we examined their expression in the cranial region. The results revealed surprising overlap and distinct localization of Ecad and Ncad in the neural tube. Using a proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Ncad and Ecad formed heterotypic complexes in the developing neural tube, and that modulation of Ncad levels led to reciprocal gain or reduction of Ecad protein …

Crystal Rogers|The role of Sip1 in cranial neural crest development|Crystal Rogers, Marianne Bronner-Fraser|2011/8/1|Developmental Biology|356|1|238-239|Academic Press|To understand the mechanism of cerebellum (Cb) circuit formation we used two mouse alleles of the neurogenic gene Ascl1. First, to perform genetic inducible fate mapping (GIFM) we used an Ascl1CreER allele to specifically mark all neurons and glia that arise from the Cb ventricular zone (vz). Second, we used Ascl1 conditional allele to understand the role of Ascl1 in the generation of vz cell types. Using Ascl1CreER GIFM we found that each cell type has a unique temporal profile of Ascl1 expression and the final position each neuron type acquires differs depending on its Ascl1 expression. We found that Purkinje cells (Pcs), an early cohort of Bergmann glia, and four classes of GABAergic interneurons can be genetically birthdated using Ascl1CreER GIFM. In contrast, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were marked during their proliferative phase. We found that Pcs have distinct striped settling patterns depending on the day they express Ascl1, whereas interneurons (including candelabrum) attain a more outside position the later they express Ascl1. Mice lacking Ascl1 in the Cb have a major decrease in interneurons, a slight reduction in Pcs, and an imbalance of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Furthermore, Ascl1 is preferentially required in the latest born interneurons (stellate cells). Moreover, by fate mapping vz-derived cells in Ascl1 mutants, we found that Ascl1 plays a distinct role in restricting vz progenitors destined to become Pcs from becoming rhombic lip progenitors. In conclusion, our GIFM and mutant studies suggest an attractive model for Cb circuit formation, where target cells are created before regulatory cells, as well as a role for …

Crystal Rogers|The balance between N-cadherin and E-cadherin orchestrates major neuroectodermal cell fate choices|CD Rogers, L Sorrells Smith, ME Bronner|2016|Molecular Biology of the Cell|27||Art. No. P762|American Society for Cell Biology|Numerous cadherin proteins, including N‐cadherin (Ncad), E‐cadherin (Ecad), Cadherin‐11 (Cad11) and Cadherin‐7 (Cad7), are expressed in the developing neural plate as well as in neural crest cells as they delaminate from the newly closed neural tube. To clarify whether these proteins function independently or coordinately during development, we examined their relative expression in the cranial region of chick embryos. The results revealed surprising overlap of Ecad, Ncad and Cad7 in the neural tube, suggesting possible heterotypic interactions. Using a proximity ligation assay and co‐immunoprecipitation to test this hypothesis, we found that Ncad formed heterophilic complexes in the developing neural tube with Ecad. We also determined that modulation of either Ncad or Ecad levels led to reciprocal gain or reduction of the other cadherin protein. Altering levels of the two cadherin proteins affected the early fate specification of ectodermal derivatives, forcing an aberrant choice between neural crest and epidermal cells. Finally, we identified that the availability of β‐catenin plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between Ncad and Ecad in early development since co‐expression of activated β‐catenin rescues the Ncad‐overexpression phenotype. These results suggest that β‐catenin‐mediated balance of Ncad and Ecad proteins is critical for the normal development of the three ectodermal derivatives.

Crystal Rogers|Program/Abstract# 95 Evolution of SoxB1 regulation and function: Neural development from marine worm to frog|Crystal D Rogers, Doreen D Cunningham, Elena M Silva Casey|||||||SoxB1 transcription factors are encoded by early neural genes expressed in a subset of ectoderm cells that are directed to become proliferating neural progenitors. Expression of proneural proteins then drives the progenitors to exit the cell cycle, decrease the expression of the SoxB1 genes and differentiate into neurons to form the central nervous system (CNS). Interestingly, although the basic organization of the CNS in vertebrates is conserved, the pathways driving induction and differentiation vary, making it difficult to identify an ancestral molecular mechanism. To define these basal mechanisms, we will study the regulation and function of the highly conserved SoxB1 transcription factors in organisms with a simple nervous system—the hemichordate, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and the urochordate, Ciona intestinalis, and compare this to what we and others have found in the vertebrate, Xenopus laevis. We have begun to investigate their role in neural development by using gain and loss of function experiments of SoxB1 proteins from Xenopus, Ciona and Saccoglossus in Xenopus and Ciona embryos. Also we are comparing the neural induction mechanisms by studying the regulation of the SoxB1 genes in Ciona and Xenopus. With this approach we can determine which mechanism is ancestral and if the functions of the proteins involved in neural development are conserved. doi: 10.1016/j. ydbio. 2008.05. 106

In the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, the historical notion is that color change is regulated by circadian rhythms. In this study, color patterns of U. pugilator were affected by changes in temperature; crab carapaces become light in warm temperatures and dark in colder temperatures. The response to temperature occurred within 15 min (often within 5 min of exposure to the treatment), suggesting that temperature may play a key role in color change, and it is activated not through a hormonal pathway, but rather a direct response of the chromatophores. Color change occurred differently between day and night for each sex, which implies that endogenous rhythms are not the sole mechanism for color change in U. pugilator. Both sexes became darker in the cold treatment, however … 
Nyssa Silbiger|Reefs shift from net accretion to net erosion along a natural environmental gradient|Nyssa J Silbiger, Òscar Guadayol, Florence IM Thomas, Megan J Donahue|2014/11/18|Marine Ecology Progress Series|515||33-44||Coral reefs persist in an accretion-erosion balance and ocean acidification resulting from anthropogenic CO 2 emissions threatens to shift this balance in favor of net reef erosion. Corals and calcifying algae, largely responsible for reef accretion, are vulnerable to environmental changes associated with ocean acidification, but the direct effects of lower pH on reef erosion has received less attention, particularly in the context of known drivers of bioerosion and natural variability. This study examines the balance between reef accretion and erosion along a well-characterized natural environmental gradient in Kāne ‘ohe Bay, Hawai ‘i using experimental blocks of coral skeleton. Comparing before and after micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans to quantify net accretion and erosion, we show that, at the small spatial scale of this study (tens of meters), pH was a better predictor of the accretion-erosion balance than environmental drivers suggested by prior studies, including resource availability, temperature, distance from shore, or depth. In addition, this study highlights the fine-scale variation of pH in coastal systems and the importance of microhabitat variation for reef accretion and erosion processes. We demonstrate significant changes in both the mean and variance of pH on the order of meters, providing a local perspective on global increases in pCO 2. Our findings suggest that increases in reef erosion, combined with expected decreases in calcification, will accelerate the shift of coral reefs to an erosion-dominated system in a high-CO 2 world. This shift will make reefs increasingly susceptible to storm damage and sea-level rise, threatening the …

As new tools allow the in situ exploration of individual responses to fluctuations, ecologically meaningful ways of characterizing environmental variability at organism scales are needed. We investigated the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of high-frequency temporal variability in temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH experienced by benthic organisms in a shallow coastal coral reef. We used a spatio-temporal sampling design, consisting of 21 short-term time-series located along a reef flat-to-reef slope transect, coupled to a long-term station monitoring water column changes. Spectral analyses revealed sharp gradients in variance decomposed by frequency, as well as differences between physically-driven and biologically-reactive parameters. These results highlight the importance of environmental variance at organismal scales and present a new sampling scheme for exploring this variability in situ.

In this study, we investigated the distribution of anemone shrimps and their hosts along with the shrimps' host selection behavior to evaluate the degree of host specificity in a nearshore benthic community undergoing rapid environmental change. We compared the distribution of two shrimp species, Periclimenes pedersoni Chace, 1958, and Periclimenes yucatanicus (Ives, 1891), with their three anemone hosts, Condylactis gigantea (Weinland, 1860), Stichodactyla helianthus (Ellis, 1767), and Bartholomea annulata (Lesueur, 1817). The proportion of host anemones occupied by each shrimp species was significantly non-random considering abundance of each species per location and significantly different from a previous study conducted 18 yrs earlier. This was due to a …

Here we analyzed spectra of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM) in coral reefs in the context of a suite of biogeochemical parameters along gradients of SGD to characterize fDOM composition and evaluate the utility of fDOM signatures in tracking groundwater dispersal and transformation. We spatially mapped water column chemistry in Maunalua Bay, Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi by collecting 24 water samples in grids at each of two ~ 0.15 km2 regions during both high and low tides over a two-day period. We observed clear horizontal gradients in the majority of 15 measured …

Nyssa Silbiger|Secondary calcification and dissolution respond differently to future ocean conditions|NJ Silbiger, MJ Donahue|2015/1/29|Biogeosciences|12|2|567-578|Copernicus GmbH|Climate change threatens both the accretion and erosion processes that sustain coral reefs. Secondary calcification, bioerosion, and reef dissolution are integral to the structural complexity and long-term persistence of coral reefs, yet these processes have received less research attention than reef accretion by corals. In this study, we use climate scenarios from RCP 8.5 to examine the combined effects of rising ocean acidity and sea surface temperature (SST) on both secondary calcification and dissolution rates of a natural coral rubble community using a flow-through aquarium system. We found that secondary reef calcification and dissolution responded differently to the combined effect of pCO2 and temperature. Calcification had a non-linear response to the combined effect of pCO2 and temperature: the highest calcification rate occurred slightly above ambient conditions and the lowest calcification rate was in the highest temperature–pCO2 condition. In contrast, dissolution increased linearly with temperature–pCO2 . The rubble community switched from net calcification to net dissolution at +271 μatm pCO2 and 0.75 °C above ambient conditions, suggesting that rubble reefs may shift from net calcification to net dissolution before the end of the century. Our results indicate that (i) dissolution may be more sensitive to climate change than calcification and (ii) that calcification and dissolution have different functional responses to climate stressors; this highlights the need to study the effects of climate stressors on both calcification and dissolution to predict future changes in coral reefs.

Such plasticity can permit local adaptation but it can also be constrained by physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Here, we explore how different temperature regimes along a latitudinal gradient spanning the natural range of a species of fiddler crab may affect the ability of crabs to change color rapidly in response to acute changes of temperature. Uca pugilator populations from New York (NY), North Carolina (NC) and Florida (FL) were exposed in air to 5 °C and 35 °C and carapace shade intensity (from dark to light color) and contrast was recorded. In general, individuals darkened when exposed to cold conditions, and lightened when exposed to warm conditions. Males from different populations differed in the magnitude of response to temperature, but had similar directional …

In this study, we monitored silica biomineralization in the Hawaiian sponge Mycale grandis under predicted pCO2 and sea surface temperature scenarios for 2100. Our goal was to determine if spicule biomineralization was enhanced or repressed by ocean acidification and thermal stress by monitoring silica uptake rates during short-term (48 h) experiments and comparing biomineralized tissue ratios before and after a long-term (26 d) experiment. In the short-term experiment, we found that silica uptake rates were not impacted by high pCO2 (1050 µatm), warmer temperatures (27°C), or combined high pCO2 with warmer temperature (1119 µatm; 27°C) treatments.

Nyssa Silbiger|A novel μCT analysis reveals different responses of bioerosion and secondary accretion to environmental variability|Nyssa J Silbiger, Òscar Guadayol, Florence IM Thomas, Megan J Donahue|2016/4/13|PloS one|11|4|e0153058|Public Library of Science|Corals build reefs through accretion of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) skeletons, but net reef growth also depends on bioerosion by grazers and borers and on secondary calcification by crustose coralline algae and other calcifying invertebrates. However, traditional field methods for quantifying secondary accretion and bioerosion confound both processes, do not measure them on the same time-scale, or are restricted to 2D methods. In a prior study, we compared multiple environmental drivers of net erosion using pre- and post-deployment micro-computed tomography scans (μCT; calculated as the % change in volume of experimental CaCO3 blocks) and found a shift from net accretion to net erosion with increasing ocean acidity. Here, we present a novel μCT method and detail a procedure that aligns and digitally subtracts pre- and post-deployment μCT scans and measures the simultaneous response of secondary accretion and bioerosion on blocks exposed to the same environmental variation over the same time-scale. We tested our method on a dataset from a prior study and show that it can be used to uncover information previously unattainable using traditional methods. We demonstrated that secondary accretion and bioerosion are driven by different environmental parameters, bioerosion is more sensitive to ocean acidity than secondary accretion, and net erosion is driven more by changes in bioerosion than secondary accretion. 
Nyssa Silbiger|Invasive lionfish had no measurable effect on prey fish community structure across the Belizean Barrier Reef|Serena Hackerott, Abel Valdivia, Courtney E Cox, Nyssa J Silbiger, John F Bruno|2017/5/25|PeerJ|5||e3270|PeerJ Inc.|Invasive lionfish are assumed to significantly affect Caribbean reef fish communities. However, evidence of lionfish effects on native reef fishes is based on uncontrolled observational studies or small-scale, unrepresentative experiments, with findings ranging from no effect to large effects on prey density and richness. Moreover, whether lionfish affect populations and communities of native reef fishes at larger, management-relevant scales is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of lionfish on coral reef prey fish communities in a natural complex reef system. We quantified lionfish and the density, richness, and composition of native prey fishes (0–10 cm total length) at sixteen reefs along∼ 250 km of the Belize Barrier Reef from 2009 to 2013. Lionfish invaded our study sites during this four-year longitudinal study, thus our sampling included fish community structure before and after our sites were invaded, ie, we employed a modified BACI design. We found no evidence that lionfish measurably affected the density, richness, or composition of prey fishes. It is possible that higher lionfish densities are necessary to detect an effect of lionfish on prey populations at this relatively large spatial scale. Alternatively, negative effects of lionfish on prey could be small, essentially undetectable, and ecologically insignificant at our study sites. Other factors that influence the dynamics of reef fish populations including reef complexity, resource availability, recruitment, predation, and fishing could swamp any effects of lionfish on prey populations.

Here, we investigated the effect of SGD on coral growth and bioerosion rates from Porites lobata nubbins and blocks of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on two reef flats in Maunalua Bay, O'ahu. Over a 6‐month (coral nubbins) and yearlong (CaCO3 blocks) deployment period, we combined multiple metrics of coral growth (buoyant weight, surface area, and linear extension) and bioerosion with a suite of co‐measured physicochemical parameters that are indicators for SGD (carbonate chemistry, dissolved inorganic nutrients, temperature, salinity, and water motion). All coral growth metrics showed a modal response to SGD, and the percent change in buoyant weights and nubbin surface area were negatively related to pH variation. SGD …

Their discussion falls largely on two publications, Silbiger et al. and DeCarlo et al. Here, we demonstrate that critical errors in plotting, statistical analysis, and data selection in Schönberg et al.’s reanalysis, result in a gross misrepresentation of these studies. Further, we argue three key points regarding field-based studies that require broader discussion within the bioerosion community and marine scientists in general: (1) that natural variability in field studies is not a flaw, (2) interpretations must be supported by mechanistic understanding, and (3) field-based studies play an essential role in elucidating interactions between OA and natural variability that is not captured by laboratory …

We found that biological processes were the primary drivers of local pH conditions. Specifically, non-encrusting producer-dominated systems had the highest and most variable pH environments and the highest production rates, patterns that were consistent across sites spanning 11 of latitude and encompassing multiple gradients of natural variability. Furthermore, we demonstrated a biophysical feedback loop in which net community production increased pH, leading to higher net ecosystem calcification …

However, a few reefs have shown resilience to recent disturbances, and here we suggest that more comprehensive attention to comparative approaches could lead to a deeper understanding of the processes causing declining coral cover and impaired ecological resilience. Using sites in Mo’orea, French Polynesia, and Panama, Eastern Tropical Pacific, as examples of resilient reefs that have been studied for over 35 yr, we demonstrate the potential of the comparative approach by exploring different ecological drivers of community resilience at each location. In both cases, coral reef community resilience is associated with strong herbivory, but in Mo’orea, resilience is a product of rapid coral community recovery through sexual recruitment in response to a largely indiscriminate disturbance (crown-of-thorns seastars), while in Panama, resilience appears to be a product of corals acquiring resistance to a repetitive selective disturbance (bleaching). Based on these trends, we propose a hypothesis-driven conceptual framework to test for mechanisms driving community resilience. The recent decade of coral reef degradation has brought time-series analyses to the forefront of research on these systems, where they are detecting disturbances that are unique to modern ecological science. Without explicit comparison among systems, the research potential of these projects will not be fully realized.

Reef building corals are sensitive to temperature due to their endosymbiotic relationship with single celled dinoflagellates, with mass mortality events increasing in frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this study was to quantify the thermal sensitivity of important physiological functions of a Caribbean reef-building coral, Orbicella franksi through the measurement of thermal performance curves (TPCs). We compared TPC metrics (thermal optimum, critical maximum, activation energy, deactivation energy, and rate at a standardized temperature) between two populations at the northern and southern extent of the geographic range of this species. We further compared essential coral organismal processes (gross photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) within a site to determine which function is most sensitive to thermal stress using a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. We found evidence for differences in thermal performance, which could be due to thermal adaptation or acclimatization, with higher TPC metrics (thermal optimum and critical maximum) in warmer Panama, compared to cooler Bermuda. We also documented the hierarchy in thermal sensitivity of essential organismal functions within a population, with respiration less sensitive than photosynthesis, which was less sensitive than calcification. Understanding thermal performance of corals is essential for projecting coral reef futures, given that key biological functions necessary to …

The New Zealand mussel guild is uniquely diverse as four species can be found within 1 m 2 of shoreline. We integrated comparative ecophysiology and population ecology to evaluate whether air temperature sets elevational range limits and to quantify mussels’ warming tolerances. Air temperature appears to set upper intertidal limits across mid-intertidal species, based on findings that (1) lethal thermal …

Daily changes in pH and other carbonate parameters in coastal ecosystems, associated with processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, often greatly exceed global mean predicted changes over the next century. We assessed the strength of these feedbacks under projected elevated CO 2 levels by conducting a field experiment in 10 macrophyte-dominated tide pools on the coast of California, USA. We evaluated changes in carbonate parameters over time and found that under ambient conditions, daytime changes in pH, pCO 2, net ecosystem calcification (NEC), and O 2 concentrations were strongly related to rates of net community production (NCP). CO 2 was added to pools during daytime low tides, which should have reduced pH and enhanced pCO 2. However, photosynthesis rapidly reduced pCO 2 and increased pH, so effects of CO 2 addition were not apparent unless we accounted for seaweed and surfgrass abundances. In the absence of macrophytes, CO 2 addition caused pH to decline by∼ 0.6 units and pCO 2 to increase by∼ 487 µatm over 6 hr during the daytime low tide. As macrophyte abundances increased, the impacts of CO 2 addition declined because more CO 2 was absorbed due to photosynthesis. Effects of CO 2 addition were, therefore, modified by feedbacks between NCP, pH, pCO 2, and NEC. Our results underscore the potential importance of coastal macrophytes in ameliorating impacts of ocean acidification.

On coral reefs, four primary groups of benthic organisms dominate photosynthetic production: corals, macroalgae, microphytobenthos, and encrusting algae on rubble, all of which exude significant quantities of DOM. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to characterize and contrast DOM exudates from these four organismal groups under three levels of continuous inorganic nutrient enrichment. We measured bulk dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen and the multivariate spectral characteristics of fluorescent DOM (fDOM). Moderate nutrient enrichment enhanced DOM exudation by all producers. Corals exuded rapidly accumulating DOM with a markedly high concentration of aromatic amino acid-like fDOM components that clearly distinguishes them from algal exudates, which were dominated by humic-like fDOM components and did not accumulate significantly. Our results emphasize the differences between coral and algae in their potential to influence microbial communities and metabolism in reefs.

Predictions of reef 38 response to changing ocean conditions are often based on the response of reef building corals alone (Silverman 39 et al., 2009; Pandolfi et al., 2011); however, coral reef bioerosion from borers and grazers and secondary accretion 40 from crustose coralline algae and other encrusting invertebrates are also critical processes for reef sustainability 41 (Przeslawski et al., 2008). There are several gaps in our knowledge about the response of coral reefs to future ocean 42 conditions and whether reef accretion will continue to exceed reef erosion. 1) Will primary accretion, secondary 43 accretion, and reef erosion respond similarly to environmental drivers and will their responses combine to accel-44 erate reef loss?

Nyssa Silbiger|Environmental drivers of the coral reef accretion-erosion balance in present and future ocean conditions|Nyssa J Silbiger|2015||||||Worldwide, declines in coral cover and shifts in coral reef community composition have raised concerns about whether reef accretion will continue to exceed reef erosion. Reef persistence is influenced by global and local anthropogenic factors, such as ocean warming, acidification, eutrophication, and overfishing, as well as natural environmental variability. Predicting reef response to environmental stress requires an understanding of both natural and anthropogenic environmental drivers of reef accretion and erosion, and how these drivers interact at different spatiotemporal scales. In Chapters 2 and 3, I measured the variation in accretion, erosion, and net change rates along a natural gradient to determine the dominant environmental drivers of accretion-erosion rates at small spatial scales (tens of meters). In Chapter 4, I expanded the geographic range to 1000s of kilometers, measuring variation in accretion and …

The identity of the receptor for CRP has been the target of extensive research. We previously determined that CRP binds to the high affinity receptor for IgG, FcγRI (CD64). However, this interaction could not account for the majority of binding of CRP to neutrophils or monocytic cells. We now determine that CRP also interacts with FcγRIIa (CD32), the low affinity receptor for IgG on monocytes and neutrophils. COS-7 cells were transfected with a construct containing the human FcγRIIA cDNA. CRP binding and the presence of CD32 were detected by mAb and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. Cells expressing CD32 bound CRP in a dose-dependent and saturable manner consistent with receptor binding. CRP …

To better understand the molecular mechanisms governing transport of the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), we have identified host proteins that participate in the conversion of the LCV into a replicative organelle. Our data show that Rab1 is recruited to the LCV within minutes of uptake. Rab1 recruitment to the LCV precedes remodeling of this compartment by ER-derived vesicles. Genetic inhibition studies demonstrate that Rab1 is important for the recruitment of ER-derived vesicles to the LCV and that inhibiting Rab1 function abrogates intracellular growth of Legionella. Morphological studies indicate that the Sec22b protein is located on ER-derived vesicles recruited to the LCV and that Sec22b is delivered to the LCV …

Rab7 is required for late endosomal transport and here we establish that the phosphatidylinositol 3′‐kinase hVPS34 and its adaptor protein p150 are rab7 interacting partners. The hVPS34/p150 complex colocalized with rab7 on late endosomes and hVPS34 activity was dependent on nucleotide cycling of rab7. In addition, total cellular phosphatidylinositol 3′‐phosphate levels were modulated by rab7 expression, suggesting that rab7 activation impacted kinase cycling to early endosomes. The data identify rab7 as an important regulator of late endosomal hVPS34 function and link rab7 to the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3′‐kinase cycling between early and late endosomes.

In their active forms, rab proteins serve in cargo selection and as scaffolds for the sequential assembly of effectors requisite for vesicle budding, cytoskeletal transport, and target membrane fusion. Rab protein function is in turn tightly regulated at the level of protein expression, localization, membrane association, and activation. Alterations in the rab GTPases and associated regulatory proteins or effectors have increasingly been implicated in causing human disease. Some diseases such as those resulting in bleeding and pigmentation disorders (Griscelli syndrome), mental retardation, neuropathy (Charcot–Marie–Tooth), kidney disease (tuberous sclerosis), and blindness (choroideremia) arise from direct loss of function mutations of rab GTPases or associated regulatory molecules. In contrast, in a …

We have recently determined that the high and low affinity receptors for CRP on human leukocytes are FcγRIIa and FcγRI, respectively. Previous work by others suggested that CRP receptors on mouse macrophages are distinct from FcγR. We have taken advantage of the availability of mice deficient in one or more FcγR to reexamine the role of FcγR in CRP binding to mouse leukocytes. Three strains of FcγR-deficient mice were examined: γ-chain-deficient mice that lack FcγRI and FcγRIII, FcγRII-deficient mice, and mice deficient in both γ-chain and FcγRII that lack all FcγR. No binding of CRP was detected to leukocytes from double-deficient mice, indicating that FcγR are required for CRP binding.

The goal of this study was to elucidate amino acid residues important for the interaction of CRP with human FcγRI (CD64) and FcγRIIa (CD32). Several mutations of the CRP structure were studied based on the published crystal structure of CRP.

Loss of endosomal phosphatidylinositol 3‐phosphate [PI(3)P] upon overexpression of wild‐type MTM1, but not a phosphatase‐dead MTM1C375S mutant, resulted in altered early and late endosomal PI(3)P levels and rapid depletion of early endosome antigen‐1. Membrane‐bound MTM1 was directly complexed to the hVPS15/hVPS34 [vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)] PI 3‐kinase complex with binding mediated by the WD40 domain of the hVPS15 (p150) adapter protein and independent of a GRAM‐domain point mutation that blocks PI(3,5)P2 binding.

Immunohistochemical analyses of PR expression and subcellular compartmentalization were also performed on 20 formalin-fixed endometrial cancer tumors. Results Morphological and biochemical evaluations demonstrated that PRA is localized to the nucleus, even in the absence of progesterone. In contrast, a large proportion of PRB is cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand, but is rapidly … 
Mary-Pat Stein|Altered trafficking and epithelial cell polarity in disease|Mary-Pat Stein, Angela Wandinger-Ness, Tamara Roitbak|2002/8/1||12|8|374-381|Elsevier Current Trends|Establishment and maintenance of a polarized epithelium relies on the integration of signaling cascades, acquisition of specialized trafficking circuits and establishment of a unique cytoarchitecture. Defects in any of these processes can adversely affect cell polarity and cause defects in specific organs and systemic disease. Mutations that disrupt the proper transport of individual plasma membrane proteins, or inactivate components of the epithelial-specific trafficking machinery, have severe functional consequences. Links between renal diseases and defects in trafficking, differentiation or signaling, highlight the delicate balance between these parameters which, when altered, precipitates a loss of renal function.

Host cell Rab GTPases are critical for intracellular transport following pathogen phagocytosis or endocytosis. At the molecular level bacterial effectors hijack Rab protein function to: evade degradation, direct transport to particular intracellular locations and monopolize host vesicles carrying molecules that are needed for a stable niche and/or bacterial growth and differentiation. Bacterial effectors may serve …

These cells change from non‐motile into highly motile cells migrating to distant areas before further differentiation. Mechanisms controlling delamination and subsequent migration of neural crest cells are not fully understood. Slit2, a chemorepellant for axonal guidance that repels and stimulates motility of trunk neural crest cells away from the gut has recently been suggested to be a tumor suppressor molecule. The goal of this study was to further investigate the role of Slit2 in trunk neural crest cell migration by constitutive expression in neural crest cells. Results: We found that Slit gain‐of‐function significantly impaired neural crest cell migration while Slit loss‐of‐function favored migration. In addition, we observed that the distribution of key …

Although the presence of receptors for CRP on phagocytes has been inferred for years, their identity was determined only recently. Fc?RIa, the high-affinity IgG receptor, binds CRP with low affinity, whereas Fc?RIIa, the low-affinity IgG receptor, binds CRP with high affinity. Because the single nucleotide polymorphism in Fc?RIIa - which encodes histidine or arginine at position 131 - strongly influences IgG2 binding, we determined this polymorphism's effect on CRP binding. CRP bound with high avidity to monocytes and neutrophils from Fc?RIIa R-131 homozygotes, and binding was inhibited by the R-specific mAb 41H16. CRP showed decreased binding to cells from Fc?RIIa H-131 homozygotes (which bind IgG2 with high affinity). However, IFN-? enhanced Fc?RI expression by H-131 monocytes and increased CRP binding. Fc?RIIa heterozygotes showed intermediate binding. CRP initiated increases in [Ca2+]i in PMN from R-131, but not from H-131 homozygotes. These data provide direct genetic evidence for Fc?RIIa as the functional, high-affinity CRP receptor on leukocytes while emphasizing the reciprocal relationship between IgG and CRP binding avidities. This counterbalance may affect the contribution of Fc?RIIa alleles to host defense and autoimmunity.

When coupled with a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based module, our sensors can discriminate between viral strains with single-base resolution. We successfully demonstrate a simple, field-ready sample-processing workflow and detect Zika virus from the plasma of a viremic macaque. Our freeze-dried biomolecular platform resolves important practical limitations to the deployment of molecular diagnostics … 
Melissa Takahashi|Creating small transcription activating RNAs|James Chappell, Melissa K Takahashi, Julius B Lucks|2015/3|Nature chemical biology|11|3|214|Nature Publishing Group|We expanded the mechanistic capability of small RNAs by creating an entirely synthetic mode of regulation: small transcription activating RNAs (STARs). Using two strategies, we engineered synthetic STAR regulators to disrupt the formation of an intrinsic transcription terminator placed upstream of a gene in Escherichia coli. This resulted in a group of four highly orthogonal STARs that had up to 94-fold activation. By systematically modifying sequence features of this group, we derived design principles for STAR function, which we then used to forward engineer a STAR that targets a terminator found in the Escherichia coli genome. Finally, we showed that STARs could be combined in tandem to create previously unattainable RNA-only transcriptional logic gates. STARs provide a new mechanism of regulation that will expand our ability to use small RNAs to construct synthetic gene networks that precisely control … 
Melissa Takahashi|Rapidly characterizing the fast dynamics of RNA genetic circuitry with cell-free transcription–translation (TX-TL) systems|Melissa K Takahashi, James Chappell, Clarmyra A Hayes, Zachary Z Sun, Jongmin Kim, Vipul Singhal, Kevin J Spring, Shaima Al-Khabouri, Christopher P Fall, Vincent Noireaux, Richard M Murray, Julius B Lucks|2014/3/28|ACS synthetic biology|4|5|503-515|American Chemical Society|RNA regulators are emerging as powerful tools to engineer synthetic genetic networks or rewire existing ones. A potential strength of RNA networks is that they may be able to propagate signals on time scales that are set by the fast degradation rates of RNAs. However, a current bottleneck to verifying this potential is the slow design-build-test cycle of evaluating these networks in vivo. Here, we adapt an Escherichia coli-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system for rapidly prototyping RNA networks. We used this system to measure the response time of an RNA transcription cascade to be approximately five minutes per step of the cascade. We also show that this response time can be adjusted with temperature and regulator threshold tuning. Finally, we use TX-TL to prototype a new RNA network, an RNA single input module, and show that this network temporally stages the expression of two genes in … 
Melissa Takahashi|A renaissance in RNA synthetic biology: new mechanisms, applications and tools for the future|James Chappell, Kyle E Watters, Melissa K Takahashi, Julius B Lucks|2015/10/1||28||47-56|Elsevier Current Trends|Since our ability to engineer biological systems is directly related to our ability to control gene expression, a central focus of synthetic biology has been to develop programmable genetic regulatory systems. Researchers are increasingly turning to RNA regulators for this task because of their versatility, and the emergence of new powerful RNA design principles. Here we review advances that are transforming the way we use RNAs to engineer biological systems. First, we examine new designable RNA mechanisms that are enabling large libraries of regulators with protein-like dynamic ranges. Next, we review emerging applications, from RNA genetic circuits to molecular diagnostics. Finally, we describe new experimental and computational tools that promise to accelerate our understanding of RNA folding, function and design. 
Melissa Takahashi|Characterizing and prototyping genetic networks with cell-free transcription–translation reactions|Melissa K Takahashi, Clarmyra A Hayes, James Chappell, Zachary Z Sun, Richard M Murray, Vincent Noireaux, Julius B Lucks|2015/9/15|Methods|86||60-72|Academic Press|A central goal of synthetic biology is to engineer cellular behavior by engineering synthetic gene networks for a variety of biotechnology and medical applications. The process of engineering gene networks often involves an iterative ‘design–build–test’ cycle, whereby the parts and connections that make up the network are built, characterized and varied until the desired network function is reached. Many advances have been made in the design and build portions of this cycle. However, the slow process of in vivo characterization of network function often limits the timescale of the testing step. Cell-free transcription–translation (TX–TL) systems offer a simple and fast alternative to performing these characterizations in cells. Here we provide an overview of a cell-free TX–TL system that utilizes the native Escherichia coli TX–TL machinery, thereby allowing a large repertoire of parts and networks to be characterized. As … 
Melissa Takahashi|The centrality of RNA for engineering gene expression|James Chappell, Melissa K Takahashi, Sarai Meyer, David Loughrey, Kyle E Watters, Julius Lucks|2013/12|Biotechnology journal|8|12|1379-1395|WILEY‐VCH Verlag|Synthetic biology holds promise as both a framework for rationally engineering biological systems and a way to revolutionize how we fundamentally understand them. Essential to realizing this promise is the development of strategies and tools to reliably and predictably control and characterize sophisticated patterns of gene expression. Here we review the role that RNA can play towards this goal and make a case for why this versatile, designable, and increasingly characterizable molecule is one of the most powerful substrates for engineering gene expression at our disposal. We discuss current natural and synthetic RNA regulators of gene expression acting at key points of control – transcription, mRNA degradation, and translation. We also consider RNA structural probing and computational RNA structure predication tools as a way to study RNA structure and ultimately function. Finally, we discuss how next … 
Melissa Takahashi|A modular strategy for engineering orthogonal chimeric RNA transcription regulators|Melissa K Takahashi, Julius B Lucks|2013/6/12|Nucleic acids research|41|15|7577-7588|Oxford University Press|Antisense RNA transcription attenuators are a key component of the synthetic biology toolbox, with their ability to serve as building blocks for both signal integration logic circuits and transcriptional cascades. However, a central challenge to building more sophisticated RNA genetic circuitry is creating larger families of orthogonal attenuators that function independently of each other. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a modular strategy to create chimeric fusions between the engineered transcriptional attenuator from plasmid pT181 and natural antisense RNA translational regulators. Using in vivo gene expression assays in Escherichia coli , we demonstrate our ability to create chimeric attenuators by fusing sequences from five different translational regulators. Mutagenesis of these functional attenuators allowed us to create a total of 11 new chimeric attenutaors … 
Melissa Takahashi|Using in-cell SHAPE-Seq and simulations to probe structure–function design principles of RNA transcriptional regulators|Melissa K Takahashi, Kyle E Watters, Paul M Gasper, Timothy R Abbott, Paul D Carlson, Alan A Chen, Julius B Lucks|2016/6/1|Rna|22|6|920-933|Cold Spring Harbor Lab|Antisense RNA-mediated transcriptional regulators are powerful tools for controlling gene expression and creating synthetic gene networks. RNA transcriptional repressors derived from natural mechanisms called attenuators are particularly versatile, though their mechanistic complexity has made them difficult to engineer. Here we identify a new structure–function design principle for attenuators that enables the forward engineering of new RNA transcriptional repressors. Using in-cell SHAPE-Seq to characterize the structures of attenuator variants within Escherichia coli, we show that attenuator hairpins that facilitate interaction with antisense RNAs require interior loops for proper function. Molecular dynamics simulations of these attenuator variants suggest these interior loops impart structural flexibility. We further observe hairpin flexibility in the cellular structures of natural RNA mechanisms that use antisense RNA …

While numerous chemistry and physics classroom demonstrations exist, few biology demonstrations are practical and accessible due to the challenges and concerns of growing living cells in classrooms. We introduce BioBits™ Explorer, a synthetic biology educational kit based on shelf-stable, freeze-dried, cell-free (FD-CF) reactions, which are activated by simply adding water. The FD-CF reactions engage the senses of sight, smell, and touch with outputs that produce fluorescence, fragrances, and hydrogels, respectively. We introduce components that can teach tunable protein expression, enzymatic reactions, biomaterial formation, and biosensors using RNA switches, some of which represent original FD-CF outputs that expand …

We demonstrate species-specific detection of mRNAs from 10 different bacteria that affect human health and four clinically relevant host biomarkers. We develop a method to quantify mRNA using our toehold sensors and validate our platform on clinical stool samples by comparison to RT-qPCR. We further highlight the potential clinical utility of the platform by showing that it can be used to rapidly and …

Here, we expand the repertoire of synthetic gene networks built from these regulators by constructing a transcriptional negative autoregulation (NAR) network out of small RNAs (sRNAs). NAR network motifs are core motifs of natural genetic networks, and are known for reducing network response time and steady state signal. Here we use cell-free transcription–translation (TX-TL) reactions and a computational model to design and prototype sRNA NAR constructs. Using parameter sensitivity analysis, we design a simple set of experiments that allow us to accurately predict NAR function in TX-TL. We transfer successful network designs into Escherichia coli and show that our sRNA transcriptional network reduces both network response time and steady-state gene expression. This work broadens our ability to construct increasingly … 
Melissa Takahashi|Developing design principles for engineering RNA transcription regulators and RNA synthetic gene networks|Melissa Kimie Takahashi|2015||||||A major goal of synthetic biology is to reliably engineer microorganisms to perform a variety of functions with impact in the fields of biotechnology and medicine. Cells naturally control their behavior and process information via genetic networks–webs of interactions between cellular regulatory molecules that ultimately control when specific genes are expressed. Therefore, the route that synthetic biologists have taken to engineer microorganisms has been through constructing synthetic gene networks. Historically, these networks were built using proteins that regulate transcription, but recently RNAs have emerged as versatile molecules that can be engineered to regulate all aspects of gene expression. Aside from their versatility, RNAs offer potential advantages over protein regulators for engineering synthetic gene networks. RNAs are relatively easy to engineer due to the direct relationship between their structure … 
Casey terHorst|The risk of polyspermy in three congeneric sea urchins and its implications for gametic incompatibility and reproductive isolation|Don R Levitan, Casey P TerHorst, Nicole D Fogarty|2007/8|Evolution|61|8|2007-2014|Blackwell Publishing Inc|Developmental failure caused by excess sperm (polyspermy) is thought to be an important mechanism driving the evolution of gamete‐recognition proteins, reproductive isolation, and speciation in marine organisms. However, these theories assume that there is heritable variation in the susceptibility to polyspermy and that this variation is related to the overall affinity between sperm and eggs. These assumptions have not been critically examined. We investigated the relationship between ease of fertilization and susceptibility to polyspermy within and among three congeneric sea urchins. The results from laboratory studies indicate that, both within and among species, individuals and species that produce eggs capable of fertilization at relatively low sperm concentrations are more susceptible to polyspermy, whereas individuals and species producing eggs that require higher concentrations of sperm to be fertilized … 
Casey terHorst|Evolution of prey in ecological time reduces the effect size of predators in experimental microcosms|Thomas E Miller, Don R Levitan|2010/3/1|Ecology|91|3|629-636|Wiley-Blackwell|Ecologists have long studied the effect of predators on prey population abundance while evolutionary biologists have measured prey trait evolution in response to predation. Ecological and evolutionary processes were generally thought to occur on different time scales, but recent evidence suggests that evolution may alter the ecological effects of predation over the course of ecological experiments. We used a protozoan and its mosquito‐larvae predator, naturally found in the water‐filled leaves of pitcher plants, to examine the effect of prey evolution on predator–prey interactions. In experiments conducted over 12 days (approximately 50 prey generations, but less than one predator generation), we measured a decrease in the effect of mosquito larvae predators on protozoa prey populations. In a separate set of experiments, we found that the presence of predators corresponded with evolution of smaller cell size … 
Casey terHorst|FERTILIZATION SUCCESS CAN DRIVE PATTERNS OF PHASE DOMINANCE IN COMPLEX LIFE HISTORIES1|Janna Fierst, Casey TerHorst, Janet E Kübler, Steve Dudgeon|2005/4|Journal of phycology|41|2|238-249|Blackwell Science Inc|Many algal life cycles alternate between two free‐living generations. Life histories in which the two generations look identical (isomorphic) are common, particularly in the Rhodophyta. Reports of natural populations dominated by one generation of the life history have sought explanation in terms of phase‐specific differences in mortality and reproductive output, yet in many cases identification of these adaptations has been elusive or inconsistent with predictions. We hypothesized that the gametophyte‐to‐sporophyte ratio of ecologically equivalent isomorphs could result from variation in fertilization rate. We developed two models to test this hypothesis: one representing a generalized isomorphic life history and the other specific to red algae with a Polysiphonia‐type life history. Fertilization rate affected the gametophyte‐to‐sporophyte ratio, especially at low fertilization rates. In the general model, gametophytes … 
Casey terHorst|Evolution in response to direct and indirect ecological effects in pitcher plant inquiline communities|Casey P TerHorst|2010/10/18|The American Naturalist|176|6|675-685|The University of Chicago Press|Ecologists have long recognized the importance of indirect ecological effects on species abundances, coexistence, and diversity. However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the … 
Casey terHorst|The relative importance of rapid evolution for plant-microbe interactions depends on ecological context|Casey P terHorst, Jay T Lennon, Jennifer A Lau|2014/6/22|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|281|1785|20140028|The Royal Society|Evolution can occur on ecological time-scales, affecting community and ecosystem processes. However, the importance of evolutionary change relative to ecological processes remains largely unknown. Here, we analyse data from a long-term experiment in which we allowed plant populations to evolve for three generations in dry or wet soils and used a reciprocal transplant to compare the ecological effect of drought and the effect of plant evolutionary responses to drought on soil microbial communities and nutrient availability. Plants that evolved under drought tended to support higher bacterial and fungal richness, and increased fungal : bacterial ratios in the soil. Overall, the magnitudes of ecological and evolutionary effects on microbial communities were similar; however, the strength and direction of these effects depended on the context in which they were measured. For example, plants that evolved in dry …

Casey terHorst|Quantifying nonadditive selection caused by indirect ecological effects|Jennifer A Lau, Idelle A Cooper, Kane R Keller, Raffica J La Rosa, Anne M Royer, Elizabeth H Schultheis, Tomomi Suwa, Jeffrey K Conner|2015/9/1|Ecology|96|9|2360-2369|Wiley-Blackwell|In natural biological communities, species interact with many other species. Multiple species interactions can lead to indirect ecological effects that have important fitness consequences and can cause nonadditive patterns of natural selection. Given that indirect ecological effects are common in nature, nonadditive selection may also be quite common. As a result, quantifying nonadditive selection resulting from indirect ecological effects may be critical for understanding adaptation in natural communities composed of many interacting species. We describe how to quantify the relative strength of nonadditive selection resulting from indirect ecological effects compared to the strength of pairwise selection. We develop a clear method for testing for nonadditive selection caused by indirect ecological effects and consider how it might affect adaptation in multispecies communities. We use two case studies to illustrate how … 
Casey terHorst|Testing successional hypotheses of stability, heterogeneity, and diversity in pitcher-plant inquiline communities|Thomas E Miller, Casey P terHorst|2012/9/1|Oecologia|170|1|243-251|Springer-Verlag|Succession is a foundation concept in ecology that describes changes in species composition through time, yet many successional patterns have not been thoroughly investigated. We highlight three hypotheses about succession that are often not clearly stated or tested: (1) individual communities become more stable over time, (2) replicate communities become more similar over time, and (3) diversity peaks at mid-succession. Testing general patterns of succession requires estimates of variation in trajectories within and among replicate communities. We followed replicate aquatic communities found within leaves of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea) to test these three hypotheses. We found that stability of individual communities initially decreased, but then increased in older communities. Predation was highest in younger leaves but then declined, while competition was likely strongest in older … 
Casey terHorst|Experimental evolution of protozoan traits in response to interspecific competition|CP TerHorst|2011/1|Journal of evolutionary biology|24|1|36-46|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Decades of experiments have demonstrated the ecological effect of competition, but experimental evidence for competitive effects on trait evolution is rare. I measured the evolution of six protozoan traits in response to competitors from the inquiline community of pitcher plants. Replicate populations of Colpoda, a ciliated protozoan, were allowed to evolve in response to intra‐ and interspecific competition for 20 days (approximately 100 generations), before traits were measured in two common garden environments. Populations that evolved with interspecific competition had smaller cell sizes, produced fewer cysts and had higher population growth rates relative to populations grown in monoculture. The presence of interspecific competitors led to differential lineage sorting, most likely by increasing the strength of selection. These results are the first to demonstrate protozoan evolution in response to competition and …

Consequently, predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016, the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context, focusing on microevolutionary processes. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions. Genetic correlations of … 
Casey terHorst|The Ghost of Competition Present|TE Miller, Casey P terHorst, JH Burns|2009/3|The American Naturalist|173|3|347-353||Communities have been viewed as the end product of an assembly process that results in increasing stability through time as progressively better competitors eventually dominate the other species that can emigrate from a regional pool. Previous work has explained species assemblages based on the traits of the successful species. We suggest that the traits of unsuccessful species in the regional pool may also be important for understanding which species are successful in communities. We constructed a simulation model to study what distinguishes stable, uninvasible assemblages from other possible assemblages from a regional pool of species. Our model demonstrates that both the interactions among the successful species and the interactions between these species and unsuccessful species attempting to invade the community contribute significantly to determining success in the final stable community … 
Casey terHorst|Direct and indirect transgenerational effects alter plant-herbivore interactions|Casey P terHorst, Jennifer A Lau|2012/11/1|Evolutionary ecology|26|6|1469-1480|Springer Netherlands|Theory suggests that environmental effects with transgenerational consequences, including rapid evolution and maternal effects, may affect the outcome of ecological interactions. However, indirect effects occur when interactions between two species are altered by the presence of a third species, and can make the consequences of transgenerational effects difficult to predict. We manipulated the presence of insect herbivores and the competitor Medicago polymorpha in replicated Lotus wrangelianus populations. After one generation, we used seeds from the surviving Lotus to initiate a reciprocal transplant experiment to measure how transgenerational effects altered ecological interactions between Lotus, Medicago, and insect herbivores. Herbivore leaf damage and Lotus fecundity were dependent on both parental and offspring environmental conditions. The presence of insect herbivores and Medicago in … 
Casey terHorst|A shift from exploitation to interference competition with increasing density affects population and community dynamics|Erica M Holdridge, Catalina Cuellar‐Gempeler, Casey P terHorst|2016/8|Ecology and evolution|6|15|5333-5341||Intraspecific competition influences population and community dynamics and occurs via two mechanisms. Exploitative competition is an indirect effect that occurs through use of a shared resource and depends on resource availability. Interference competition occurs by obstructing access to a resource and may not depend on resource availability. Our study tested whether the strength of interference competition changes with protozoa population density. We grew experimental microcosms of protozoa and bacteria under different combinations of protozoan density and basal resource availability. We then solved a dynamic predator–prey model for parameters of the functional response using population growth rates measured in our experiment. As population density increased, competition shifted from exploitation to interference, and competition was less dependent on resource levels. Surprisingly, the effect of … 
Casey terHorst|Rethinking niche evolution: experiments with natural communities of protozoa in pitcher plants|Thomas E Miller, Emma R Moran, Casey P terHorst|2014/6/16|The American Naturalist|184|2|277-283|University of Chicago Press|Classic niche theory predicts that competing species will evolve to use different resources and interact less, whereas recent niche-converge ideas predict that species evolve to use similar resources and interact more. Most data supporting niche evolution are based on observations of contemporary niche use, whereas experimental support is quite sparse. We followed the evolution of four species of Protozoa during succession in the water-filled leaves of the pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, and found that evolution in multispecies systems follows a surprising pattern. Over several hundred generations, weak competitors evolved to be stronger, while strong competitors evolved to become weaker, which does not conform to expectations of either niche divergence or convergence. Evolution in this system appears to occur in response to characteristics of a suite of several competitors in the community, rather than … 
Casey terHorst|Causes and consequences of failed adaptation to biological invasions: the role of ecological constraints|Jennifer A Lau, Casey P Terhorst|2015/5|Molecular ecology|24|9|1987-1998||Biological invasions are a major challenge to native communities and have the potential to exert strong selection on native populations. As a result, native taxa may adapt to the presence of invaders through increased competitive ability, increased antipredator defences or altered morphologies that may limit encounters with toxic prey. Yet, in some cases, species may fail to adapt to biological invasions. Many challenges to adaptation arise because biological invasions occur in complex species‐rich communities in spatially and temporally variable environments. Here, we review these ‘ecological’ constraints on adaptation, focusing on the complications that arise from the need to simultaneously adapt to multiple biotic agents and from temporal and spatial variation in both selection and demography. Throughout, we illustrate cases where these constraints might be especially important in native populations faced … 
Casey terHorst|Measuring ecosystem function: consequences arising from variation in biomass-productivity relationships|C terhorst, P Munguia|2008/6/1|Community ecology|9|1|39-44|Akadémiai Kiadó|Species diversity loss is expected to alter ecosystem function, but previous work has demonstrated inconsistent relationships between these two factors. Productivity is the most common measure of ecosystem function, but given the difficulty in measuring productivity, standing biomass or change in biomass are frequently used as proxy measures. A review of the recent ecosystem-function literature revealed that 93% of studies measure productivity as biomass, thereby assuming a strong positive relationship between these two variables. We tested this assumption by measuring biomass and productivity in seagrass beds in the Gulf of Mexico. We found that the relationship between standing biomass and productivity could be positive or negative, depending on site. Change in biomass over months inconsistently underestimated short-term productivity. The relationship between biomass and productivity may depend … 
Casey terHorst|Evolution as a coexistence mechanism: Does genetic architecture matter?|Sebastian J Schreiber, Swati Patel, Casey terHorst|2018/3/1|The American Naturalist|191|3|407-420|University of Chicago Press|Species sharing a prey or a predator species may go extinct due to exploitative or apparent competition. We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g., nutritional prey are harder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This intransitivity allows for … 
Casey terHorst|Genetic variation in invasive species response to direct and indirect species interactions|Casey P terHorst, Jennifer A Lau|2015/2/1|Biological invasions|17|2|651-659|Springer International Publishing|Biotic resistance to invasion arises from strong species interactions that decrease the fitness and population growth rates of potential invaders. Strong, direct interactions such as predation and competition are typically thought to drive biotic resistance, but in diverse communities, indirect interactions among species may also affect biotic resistance. Further, genetic variation in traits of the invading species that affect species interactions may allow some genotypes to overcome biotic resistance. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of a native legume (Acmispon wrangelianus) and insect herbivores on the fitness of different genotypes of an invasive legume (Medicago polymorpha) in a California grassland. Insect herbivores decreased Medicago fitness, but only in the presence of Acmispon, suggesting that indirect interactions mediated through insects and Acmispon are important for deterring …

Eleven morphological traits, including leaf length and width, angle between the leaves and internode distances, were measured for each species and analysed by principal components analysis and nested analysis of variance. The results revealed a significant signal of relatedness in vegetative morphology; genus explained 20–50% of the variance in a single trait. The relationships between some traits are consistent with adaptive explanations. The findings are consistent with the prediction that evolution for optimal phyllotaxis should be relaxed as self-shading decreases, and that light availability governs leaf size and branching patterns. Constraints potentially explain some trait correlations, and support was found for the hypothesis that …

Enriched microhabitats have been shown to be preferred oviposition sites. 2. In a field experiment designed to determine whether ovipositing mosquitoes are sensitive to different levels of nutrient enrichment, new pitcher‐plant (Sarracenia purpurea) leaves were opened and enriched with 0, 2, or 20 dead ants, and the number of pitcher‐plant mosquito (Wyeomyia smithii) larvae resulting from subsequent oviposition were measured. 3. Oviposition rates were higher in leaves with low levels of enrichment (0 and 2 ants per leaf), although larval development was enhanced at the highest enrichment level. 4. Results suggest that, although these mosquito larvae are nutrient limited, ovipositing females preferentially avoid highly enriched leaves. This … 
Casey terHorst|Context-dependent orientation cues in a supratidal amphipod|Casey P terHorst|2012/1/1|Marine and freshwater behaviour and physiology|45|1|45-50|Taylor & Francis Group|Most mobile animals rely on orientation cues for either long-distance migration or to move shorter distances on a daily basis. Supratidal amphipods in the northern Gulf of Mexico regularly use orientation cues in both water and on dry sand to return to their home in seagrass wrack. I manipulated the presence of visual and magnetic cues in both water and sand. Visual cues were important for orientation in water, but magnetic cues were important on dry sand. The use of orientation cues by amphipods is context-dependent and suggests that some cues may be more reliable in different environments. 
Casey terHorst|Testing genotypic variation of an invasive plant species in response to soil disturbance and herbivory|Shannon LJ Bayliss, Jennifer A Lau, Casey P terHorst|2017/4/1|Oecologia|183|4|1135-1141|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Herbivores, competitors, and predators can inhibit biological invasions (“biotic resistance” sensu Elton 1959), while disturbance typically promotes biological invasions. Although biotic resistance and disturbance are often considered separately in the invasion literature, these two forces may be linked. One mechanism by which disturbance may facilitate biological invasions is by decreasing the effectiveness of biotic resistance. The effects of both disturbance and biotic resistance may vary across invading genotypes, and genetic variation in the invasive propagule pool may increase the likelihood that some genotypes can overcome biotic resistance or take greater advantage of disturbance. We conducted an experimental field trial in which we manipulated soil disturbance (thatch removal and loosening soil) and the presence of insect herbivores and examined their effects on the invasion success of 44 … 
Casey terHorst|Quantifying nonadditive selection caused by indirect ecological effects: Reply|Jennifer A Lau, Jeffrey K Conner|2017/4/1|Ecology|98|4|1171-1175|Wiley-Blackwell|Indirect ecological effects can be generally classified into interaction chains and interaction modifications (Wootton 1993). Interaction chains, often called density-mediated indirect effects (Abrams 1995), result when a species alters the outcome of interactions between two other species simply because it alters the abundance of one of those species. In such chains, species only directly affect the fitness of adjacent species in the chain, while indirectly affecting the fitness of non-adjacent species. Interaction modifications, often called trait-mediated indirect effects (Abrams 1995), result when a species alters how two other species interact, without affecting their abundances. These types of indirect effects are not mutually exclusive, but in either case, these indirect ecological effects will cause nonadditive selection if the interactions influence the relationship between relative fitness and the traits that mediate the strength … 
Casey terHorst|Rapid evolution slows extinctions in food webs|Peter C Zee, Casey P terHorst, Sebastian J Schreiber|2017/1/1|bioRxiv|||107763|Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Historically, evolutionary changes have been thought to act on much longer time scales than ecological dynamics. However, a recent body of research has demonstrated that evolution that is rapid enough to dramatically affect ecological dynamics can lead to feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, to understand the stability of ecological communities, we must also consider evolutionary change in the component species. Here, we use individual-based simulations of a quantitative genetic eco-evolutionary model to describe how trait evolution influences the stability of ecological communities. On short time scales, faster evolutionary rates decreased the probability of species extinctions as populations at low densities were rescued via trait evolution. However, on longer time scales, evolutionary had little effect on the number of extinctions. The extent of short-term evolutionary rescue depended on the source of trait variation; populations with variation generated through mutation experienced more rescue events and were less prone to extinction, relative to populations with only standing trait variation. Trait evolution leading to more rescued populations increased the stability of the community on timescales relevant to conservation. Our work highlights the importance of intraspecific trait variation and the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining this variation for community ecology, as well as management of declining populations in a community context.

Casey terHorst|Pick your trade-offs wisely: Predator-prey eco-evo dynamics are qualitatively different under different trade-offs|Samuel R Fleischer, Casey P terHorst, Jing Li|2018/11/7|Journal of theoretical biology|456||201-212|Academic Press|In recent decades, myriad studies have explored the population dynamics of coevolving populations of predator and prey. A variety of choices are made in these models: exponential or logistic prey growth in the absence of a predator, various forms of predator functional response, and uni- or bi-directional trait axes. In addition, some form of trade-offs are assumed in order to prevent run-away evolution of the prey and predator traits. While there is a considerable amount of theory regarding various forms of prey growth rates and predator functional responses, only a few studies have explored how different types of trade-offs affect predator-prey dynamics. Here, we compared two ditrophic coevolution models incorporating different trade-offs via dual effects of the prey trait on attack rate and either prey carrying capacity or intrinsic growth rate. We employed a standard dynamical systems approach to analyze the …

The breakdown of this mutualism that occurs as a result of increasingly warmer ocean temperatures is a major threat to coral reef ecosystems globally. Recombination during sexual reproduction and high rates of somatic mutation can lead to increased genetic variation within symbiont species, which may provide the fuel for natural selection and adaptation. However, few studies have asked whether such variation in functional traits exists within these symbionts. We used several genotypes of two closely related species, Breviolum antillogorgium and B. minutum, to examine variation of traits related to symbiosis in response to increases in temperature or nitrogen availability in laboratory cultures. We found significant genetic variation within and among symbiont …

The ability to take advantage of novel mutualists or survive and reproduce despite a lack of mutualists may facilitate invasion by those individuals with such traits. Here, we used two greenhouse studies to examine how soil microbial communities in general and mutualistic rhizobia in particular affect the performance of a legume species (Medicago polymorpha) that has invaded five continents. We performed two plant growth experiments with Medicago polymorpha, inoculating them with soil slurries in one experiment or rhizobial cultures in another experiment. For both experiments, we compared the growth of Medicago in competition with conspecific or heterospecific plants and examined variation among plant genotypes collected from the native and introduced ranges. We found that all genotypes experienced similar increases in biomass and …

Many studies have hypothesized that plants in the introduced range will be larger than those in the native range, leading to increases in competitive ability. There is mixed support for evolution of larger sizes in the introduced range, but few studies have explicitly tested whether evolutionary changes result in decreased competitive responses or increased competitive effects on other species in the community. Here, we show that introduced Medicago polymorpha genotypes produced 14% more aboveground and 41% more belowground biomass than genotypes from the native range, suggesting that evolutionary changes in size occurred after introduction. However, these size differences were only observed in … 
Casey terHorst|Predator trait evolution alters prey community composition|Erica M Holdridge, Gilberto E Flores, Casey P terHorst|2017/5/1|Ecosphere|8|5||Wiley-Blackwell|Predators have potentially strong effects on prey abundance, growth, life histories, and behavior, but the net direction and strength of these effects depend on traits in the predator population. Trait evolution that occurs on ecological timescales is common and may affect species interactions. Using laboratory microcosms of a bacterivorous ciliate (Colpidium sp.) and a diverse community of bacteria, we tested the hypothesis that predator trait evolution in response to temperature variability and nutrient concentration alters the composition of the prey community using a two‐phase experiment. The first phase consisted of a selection experiment, in which microcosm communities were randomly assigned to one of eight fully factorial treatments of high or low nutrients, variable or stable temperatures, and with or without Colpidium. The second phase was a reciprocal transplant experiment, in which a subsample of each … 
Casey terHorst|CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF FAILED ADAPTATION TO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS: THE ROLE OF ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS|Jennifer A Lau, Casey P terHorst|2016/8/12|Invasion Genetics: The Baker and Stebbins Legacy|||139-151|John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|Biological invasions are a major challenge to native communities and have the potential to exert strong selection on native populations. As a result, native taxa may adapt to the presence of invaders through increased competitive ability, increased antipredator defences or altered morphologies that may limit encounters with toxic prey. Yet, in some cases, species may fail to adapt to biological invasions. Many challenges to adaptation arise because biological invasions occur in complex species‐rich communities in spatially and temporally variable environments. Here, we review these ‘ecological’ constraints on adaptation, focusing on the complications that arise from the need to simultaneously adapt to multiple biotic agents and from temporal and spatial variation in both selection and demography. Throughout, we illustrate cases where these constraints might be especially important in native populations … 
Casey terHorst|Evolution in Response to Direct and Indirect Effects in Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia purpurea) Inquiline Communities|Casey P terHorst|2010||||||The fields of community ecology and evolution are theoretically tightly linked, but in general, community ecologists discount evolution in describing the dynamics of present-day community patterns. Yet, evolution in response to strong selection pressure might affect species interactions and alter ecological patterns on a relatively short time scale. Conversely, evolutionary studies are typically limited to examining the evolution of traits in response to, at most, one other species. In more complex communities, higher-order indirect effects emerge that might have significant effects on how species evolve. Evolution in a community context provides more insight into how species evole in natural communities. This dissertation focuses on the evolution of a ciliated protozoan, Colpoda sp. that lives within the water-filled leaves of the purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea). The evolution of several traits was measured in response to the direct effects of predators (specialist mosquito larvae that live in the same inquilines community), competitors (another co-occuring ciliated protozoan) and indirect effects that emerge when both predators and competitors are present. Two traits (cell size and population growth rate) evolved in response to predation, resulting in predator avoidance and tolerance, respectively. The evolution of these traits resulted in a significant decrease of the ecological effect of predators in only 12 days (approximately 40 prey generations), but less than one predator generation. These same two traits, as well as cyst production, evolved in response to competition. However, evolution in response to the indirect effects that occurred when both … 
Cheryl Van Buskirk|Epidermal growth factor signaling induces behavioral quiescence in Caenorhabditis elegans|Cheryl Van Buskirk, Paul W Sternberg|2007/10|Nature neuroscience|10|10|1300|Nature Publishing Group|The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases regulate several aspects of development, including the development of the mammalian nervous system. ErbB signaling also has physiological effects on neuronal function, with influences on synaptic plasticity and daily cycles of activity. However, little is known about the effectors of EGFR activation in neurons. Here we show that EGF signaling has a nondevelopmental effect on behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. Ectopic expression of the EGF-like ligand LIN-3 at any stage induces a reversible cessation of feeding and locomotion. These effects are mediated by neuronal EGFR (also called LET-23) and phospholipase C–γ (PLC-γ), diacylglycerol-binding proteins, and regulators of synaptic vesicle release. Activation of EGFR within a single neuron, ALA, is sufficient to induce a quiescent state. This pathway modulates the cessation of … 
Cheryl Van Buskirk|Versatility in signalling: multiple responses to EGF receptor activation during Drosophila oogenesis|Cheryl Van Buskirk, Trudi Schüpbach|1999/1/1|Trends in cell biology|9|1|1-4|Elsevier Current Trends|The Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is active in different tissues and is involved in diverse processes such as patterning of the embryonic ectoderm, growth and differentiation of imaginal discs and cell survival. During oogenesis, the EGFR is expressed in the somatic follicle cells that surround individual oocyte nurse cell complexes. In response to germline signals, the follicle cells differentiate in a complex pattern, which in turn leads to the establishment of the egg axes. Two recent reports have shown that the strategies used to pattern posterior follicle cells are different from those used to pattern dorsal follicle cells. In posterior follicle cells, EGFR activity is translated into an on off response, whereas, in dorsal follicle cells, patterning mechanisms are initiated and refined by feedback that modulates receptor activity over time.

C. elegans molting cycles involve rhythmic cellular and animal behaviors linked to the periodic reconstruction of cuticles. Molts are coordinated with successive transitions in the temporal fates of epidermal blast cells, which are programmed by genes in the heterochronic regulatory network. It was known that juveniles molt at regular 8–10 hr intervals, but the anticipated pacemaker had not been characterized. Results We find that inactivation of the heterochronic gene lin-42a, which is related to the core circadian clock gene PERIOD (PER), results in arrhythmic molts and continuously abnormal epidermal stem cell dynamics. The oscillatory expression of lin-42a in the epidermis peaks during the molts. Further, forced expression of lin-42a leads to anachronistic larval molts and lethargy in adults …

To test Gurken domain functions, full-length and truncated forms of Gurken were expressed ectopically using the UAS/Gal4 expression system, or in the germline using the endogenous promoter. GrkΔC, a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain, localizes to the oocyte membrane and can signal. GrkΔTC, which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, retains signaling ability when ectopically expressed in somatic cells. However, in the germline, the GrkΔTC protein accumulates throughout the oocyte cytoplasm and cannot signal. In addition, we found that several strong gurken alleles contain point mutations in the transmembrane region. We conclude that secretion of Gurken requires its transmembrane …

Cheryl Van Buskirk|Half pint regulates alternative splice site selection in Drosophila|Cheryl Van Buskirk, Trudi Schüpbach|2002/3/1|Developmental cell|2|3|343-353|Cell Press|Alternative splicing is used by metazoans to increase protein diversity and to alter gene expression during development. However, few factors that control splice site choice in vivo have been identified. Here we describe a factor, Half pint (Hfp), that regulates RNA splicing in Drosophila. Females harboring hypomorphic mutations in hfp lay short eggs and show defects in germline mitosis, nuclear morphology, and RNA localization during oogenesis. We find that hfp encodes the Drosophila ortholog of human PUF60 and functions in both constitutive and alternative splicing in vivo. In particular, hfp mutants display striking defects in the developmentally regulated splicing of ovarian tumor (otu). Furthermore, transgenic expression of the missing otu splice form can rescue the ovarian phenotypes of hfp.

Despite its conservation throughout phylogeny, the function of sleep remains debated. Hypotheses for the purpose of sleep include nervous-system-specific functions such as modulation of synaptic strength and clearance of metabolites from the brain [3, 4], as well as more generalized cellular functions such as energy conservation and macromolecule biosynthesis [5]. These models are supported by the identification of synaptic and metabolic processes that are perturbed during prolonged wakefulness. It remains to be seen whether perturbations of cellular homeostasis in turn drive sleep. Here we show that under conditions of cellular stress, including noxious heat, cold, hypertonicity, and tissue damage, the nematode Caenorhabditis …

The molecular signaling mechanisms underlying this decision remain largely unknown. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays sleep-like quiescence following exposures that result in cellular stress [1]. The neurosecretory ALA neuron is required for this stress-induced recovery quiescence [1], but the mechanisms by which ALA induces quiescence have been unknown. We report here that quiescence induced by heat stress requires ALA depolarization and release of FMRFamide-like neuropeptides encoded by the flp-13 gene. Optogenetic activation of ALA reduces feeding and locomotion in a FLP-13-dependent manner. Overexpression of flp-13 is sufficient to induce quiescent behavior during normally active periods. We have here identified a major biological … 
Cheryl Van Buskirk|Paired and LIM class homeodomain proteins coordinate differentiation of the C. elegans ALA neuron|Cheryl Van Buskirk, Paul W Sternberg|2010/6/15|Development|137|12|2065-2074|Oxford University Press for The Company of Biologists Limited|The ancient origin of sleep is evidenced by deeply conserved signaling pathways regulating sleep-like behavior, such as signaling through the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In Caenorhabditis elegans, a sleep-like state can be induced at any time during development or adulthood through conditional expression of LIN-3/EGF. The behavioral response to EGF is mediated by EGFR activity within a single cell, the ALA neuron, and mutations that impair ALA differentiation are expected to confer EGF-resistance. Here we describe three such EGF-resistant mutants. One of these corresponds to the LIM class homeodomain (HD) protein CEH-14/Lhx3, and the other two correspond to Paired-like HD proteins CEH-10/Chx10 and CEH-17/Phox2. Whereas CEH-14 is required for ALA-specific gene expression throughout development, the Prd-like proteins display complementary temporal contributions to gene …

The gene gurken (grk) encodes a TGFalpha-like protein that is localized within the developing oocyte and is thought to locally activate torpedo/Egfr (top/Egfr), the Drosophila homolog of the EGF receptor, which is expressed throughout the follicular epithelium surrounding the oocyte. grk-Egfr signaling is required early in oogenesis for specification of posterior follicle cell fate and later in oogenesis for dorsal follicle cell fate determination, thus establishing the axes of the egg shell and embryo. Previous studies have shown that these patterning processes are highly sensitive to changes in the levels and localization of grk mRNA. Here we show that post-transcriptional regulation of Grk protein levels is required for correct pattern formation. encore … 
Cheryl Van Buskirk|Encore is a member of a novel family of proteins and affects multiple processes in Drosophila oogenesis|Cheryl Van Buskirk, Nancy C Hawkins, Trudi Schupbach|2000/11/15|Development|127|22|4753-4762|The Company of Biologists Ltd|Mutations in the encore (enc) gene of Drosophila melanogaster cause one extra round of mitosis in the germline, resulting in the formation of egg chambers with extra nurse cells. In addition, enc mutations affect the accumulation of Gurken protein within the oocyte, leading to the production of ventralized eggs. Here we show that enc mutants also exhibit abnormalities in karyosome morphology, similar to other ventralizing mutants such as okra and spindle B. Unlike these mutants, however, the defects in Gurken accumulation and karyosome formation do not result from activation of a meiotic checkpoint. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the requirement for enc in these processes is temporally distinct from its role in germline mitosis. Cloning of the enc locus and generation of anti-Enc antibodies reveal that enc encodes a large novel protein that accumulates within the oocyte cytoplasm and colocalizes with grk …

Despite the identification of neuropeptides and hormones implicated in dual control of sleep drive and appetite, our understanding of the mechanism underlying the conserved sleep-suppressing effect of food deprivation is limited.

Here we show that food deprivation potently suppresses SIS, an effect enhanced at high population density. We present evidence that food deprivation reduces the need to sleep, protecting against the lethality associated with defective SIS. Additionally, we find that SIS is regulated by both target of rapamycin and transforming …

We have observed that overexpression of the EGFR ligand LIN-3 from a heat shock inducible promoter, in addition to affecting the expected cell fates, also slows down growth of the animals as compared to heat-shocked controls.

Cheryl Van Buskirk|Do the splice variants of lin-3 differ in function?|Cheryl L Van Buskirk, Paul W Sternberg|2003|International Worm Meeting|||||The lin-3 gene encodes the only known ligand of the EGF receptor in C. elegans, and is required for viability, ovulation, vulval patterning, and other cell fate specifications. Two splice variants, lin-3A and 3B, which arise from alternate splice donor site usage, have been previously identified. Lin-3B differs from the more abundant lin-3A by the insertion of an extra 15 amino acids just N-terminal to the transmembrane domain.

Mutations in encore (enc) cause several defects in Drosophila oogenesis, reflecting roles for enc in the control of germline mitosis, karyosome formation, and the establishment of egg polarity. Cloning and expression studies reveal that enc encodes a 230kDa cytoplasmic protein with a domain of similarity shared with a group of cDNAs of unknown function. Enc was found to interact specifically with a predicted RNA-binding protein in a two-hybrid screen. Female-sterile mutations in the corresponding gene, half pint (hfp), were generated and found to cause several defects, including a reduction in germline mitosis. This mitotic phenotype is the converse of the enc extra division phenotype, suggesting that these factors act antagonistically. Furthermore, expression analysis reveals that Enc may affect Hfp localization. In wild type egg …

These patterns were seen with both" transient" transformation and with heritable transformation (the latter, using either the unc-22 antisense or the rol-6 phenotypic markers). Our control against the possibility that it was vector sequences (pBluescript) that were actually directing this ectopic expression was to gel-purify insert from the appropriate ges-1 construct and to use transient transformation (in which marker plasmid could be omitted) to show that the purified insert still caused ges-1 expression in the pharynx.

Paul Wilson|Pollination syndromes and floral specialization|Charles B Fenster, W Scott Armbruster, Paul Wilson, Michele R Dudash, James D Thomson|2004/12/15||35||375-403|Annual Reviews|▪ Abstract Floral evolution has often been associated with differences in pollination syndromes. Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect based on their syndromes and that flowers often diverge without excluding one type of pollinator in favor of another. Despite these criticisms, we show that pollination syndromes provide great utility in understanding the mechanisms of floral diversification. Our conclusions are based on the importance of organizing pollinators into functional groups according to presumed similarities in the selection pressures they exert. Furthermore, functional groups vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators for particular plant species. Thus, although a plant may be visited by several functional groups, the relative selective pressures they exert will likely be very different. We discuss various …

Despite increased recognition of the importance of disturbance in determining forest composition and structure, few studies have assessed the relative influence of current environment and historical factors on modern vegetation, in part because detailed knowledge of prior disturbance is often lacking. In the present study, we investigate modern and historical factors that control vegetation patterns at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA. Similar to the forested uplands throughout the northeastern United States, the site is physiographically heterogeneous and has a long and complex history of natural and anthropogenic disturbance … 
Paul Wilson|‘Anti‐bee’ and ‘pro‐bird’ changes during the evolution of hummingbird pollination in Penstemon flowers|MC Castellanos, P Wilson, JD Thomson|2004/7|Journal of evolutionary biology|17|4|876-885|Blackwell Science Ltd|Floral phenotypes may be as much the result of selection for avoidance of some animal visitors as selection for improving the interaction with better pollinators. When specializing on hummingbird‐pollination, Penstemon flowers may have evolved to improve the morphological fit between bird and flower, or to exclude less‐efficient bees, or both. We hypothesized how such selection might work on four floral characters that affect the mechanics of pollen transfer: anther/stigma exsertion, presence of a lower corolla lip, width of the corolla tube, and angle of flower inclination. We surgically modified bee‐pollinated P. strictus flowers changing one trait at a time to make them resemble hummingbird‐pollinated P. barbatus flowers, and measured pollen transfer by bumblebees and hummingbirds. Results suggest that, apart from ‘pro‐bird’ adaptations, specific ‘anti‐bee’ adaptations have been important in shaping … 
Paul Wilson|Beyond floral Batemania: gender biases in selection for pollination success|Paul Wilson, James D Thomson, Maureen L Stanton, Lisa P Rigney|1994/2/1|The American Naturalist|143|2|283-296|University of Chicago Press|For over a decade, Bateman's principle has been used to argue that the showy petals and sweet nectar of flowers are evolutionarily more male than female-that they are adaptations principally for promoting the export of pollen rather than the setting of seed. Here we present alternative views. (1) We question whether the assumptions of Bateman's principle have been generally upheld for angiosperms. (2) We present a path model that contradicts Bateman's principle by asserting that floral attractiveness characters might well affect fitness more deterministically through female than through male function. (3) We envision an episodic selection scenario that has the same outcome as Bateman's principle but is based specifically on the ecology and mechanics of pollination. In the end, we recognize that selection on the displays and rewards of flowers is probably often gender biased (one way or the other), but we warn … 
Paul Wilson|Pollen transfer by hummingbirds and bumblebees, and the divergence of pollination modes in Penstemon|Maria Clara Castellanos, Paul Wilson, James D Thomson|2003/12|Evolution|57|12|2742-2752|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|We compared pollen removal and deposition by hummingbirds and bumblebees visiting bird‐syndrome Penstemon barbatus and bee‐syndrome P. strictus flowers. One model for evolutionary shifts from bee pollination to bird pollination has assumed that, mostly due to grooming, pollen on bee bodies quickly becomes unavailable for transfer to stigmas, whereas pollen on hummingbirds has greater carryover. Comparing bumblebees and hummingbirds seeking nectar in P. strictus, we confirmed that bees had a steeper pollen carryover curve than birds but, surprisingly, bees and birds removed similar amounts of pollen and had similar per‐visit pollen transfer efficiencies. Comparing P. barbatus and P. strictus visited by hummingbirds, the bird‐syndrome flowers had more pollen removed, more pollen deposited, and a higher transfer efficiency than the bee‐syndrome flowers. In addition, P. barbatus flowers have … 
Paul Wilson|A multivariate search for pollination syndromes among penstemons|Paul Wilson, Maria Clara Castellanos, James N Hogue, James D Thomson, W Scott Armbruster|2004/2|Oikos|104|2|345-361|Munksgaard International Publishers|The seeming ubiquity of spatio‐temporal variation in pollination regime suggests that flowers ought to be adapted to a wide range of pollinators, yet many comparative biologists perceive that in groups with complex flowers there is considerable specialization onto pollination syndromes. Statistical documentation of such syndromes has been presented for very few groups of flowers. Accordingly, we measured, for 49 species of Penstemon and close relatives, both the morphology of the flowers and visitation by pollinators. We describe the mechanics of pollination for representative species. Ordinations show a distinct difference between hummingbird‐pollinated species and hymenopteran‐pollinated species. Flower color is particularly good at separating hummingbird‐ from hymenopteran‐flowers. Other characters are also correlated with this dichotomy. Within the hymenopteran‐pollinated species, there are … 
Paul Wilson|Explaining evolutionary shifts between bee and hummingbird pollination: convergence, divergence, and directionality|James D Thomson, Paul Wilson|2008/1|International Journal of Plant Sciences|169|1|23-38|The University of Chicago Press|In certain angiosperm genera, closely related species have diverged from one another to converge on different pollination syndromes, whereas species with intermediate phenotypes are rare or absent. Convergent conformity to syndromes implies the existence of “evolutionary attractors” toward which phenotypes are drawn; divergent breaks from conformity show that populations can escape one attractor and be drawn to another. We discuss how these two opposed processes can be reconciled for the special case of evolutionary transitions between bee pollination and hummingbird pollination. In this case, a third phenomenon, the directional bias in favor of transitions from melittophily to ornithophily, also needs explanation. Older treatments chiefly ascribed convergence to cognitive and morphological properties of pollinators and ascribed transitions to geographical differences in pollinator availability. Those … 
Paul Wilson|Pollen presentation and pollination syndromes, with special reference to Penstemon|James D Thomson, Paul Wilson, Michael Valenzuela, Maria Malzone|2000/4/1|Plant Species Biology|15|1|11-29|Wiley/Blackwell (10.1111)|Pollen presentation theory (PPT) allows for a re‐examination of some classic themes in pollination biology. Here, we outline its implications in the context of bee‐and bird‐adapted species of Penstemon and Keckiella (Scrophulariaceae). PPT models the optimal schedule of pollen presentation, based on the frequency of visits by pollinators, and the capacities of those pollinators to remove and deposit pollen. High visitation rates, high removal and low deposition all favor plants that present pollen in many small doses. Dosing is achieved through gradual opening of anthers and through anthers opening only narrowly. We hypothesize that bees have higher rates of removal and lower rates of deposition than birds; therefore, bee‐pollinated species should have anthers that open more gradually and less completely than bird‐pollinated species. Before presenting preliminary results that affirm this prediction, we critically … 
Paul Wilson|How do flowers diverge?|Paul Wilson, James D Thomson|1996||||88-111|Springer, Boston, MA|Darwin’s orchid book (1862) has been cited as his first detailed example of how to study evolution (Ghiselin, 1969; Gould, 1986). The book starts as a presentation of observations showing that the morphology of orchids is, in most cases, wonderfully well suited to having insects remove and deposit pollinia. It ends by tracing how the enormous diversity of orchids can be seen as arising through modifications from ancestral forms. What Darwin did not do was to explain how orchid flowers come to be different. He probably thought that by showing how to study the origin of adaptation he had shown how to study the origin of diversity. Mayr has often pointed out that Darwin failed to see genetic isolation as a precondition for speciation, and thus for diversification (e.g., Mayr, 1959). Likewise, we contend that evolutionists have seldom clearly dissected the alternatives for how divergence occurs, given isolation. We … 
Paul Wilson|Dynamic nectar replenishment in flowers of Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae)|Maria Clara Castellanos, Paul Wilson, James D Thomson|2002/1|American Journal of Botany|89|1|111-118|Botanical Society of America|Plants that experience variation in pollinator visitation rates or fluctuations in weather conditions may be expected to have evolved homeostatic mechanisms that regulate their nectar offerings, thereby providing a more constant reward to the pollinators. A limited degree of such nectar homeostasis is reported here for Penstemon. First, nectar removal stimulates replenishment: when nectar was removed hourly for 6 h from P. speciosus, twice as much nectar was secreted cumulatively as when nectar was removed only at the beginning and end of the same 6‐h period. Second, replacing artificial nectar in the nectaries of P. speciosus prevents replenishment. Third, the hummingbird‐adapted P. barbatus made more nectar before leveling off than the bee‐adapted P. strictus. Our work and previous studies with other plants imply mechanisms for dynamic regulation of nectar offerings, at least within broad limits. We … 
Paul Wilson|Barriers and flow as limiting factors in the spread of an invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in southern California streams|Jacob L Kerby, Seth PD Riley, Lee B Kats, Paul Wilson|2005/12/1|Biological Conservation|126|3|402-409|Elsevier|Invasive crayfish are a major threat to stream ecosystems, yet research has seldom identified successful ways of preventing their spread. Thirty-two stream sections were surveyed during 2000 and 2001 in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California to determine the distribution of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Streams with large barriers (waterfalls, culverts) often did not have crayfish present upstream of barriers. A mark-recapture study indicated that P. clarkii moved both up and downstream between pools, but that barriers significantly reduced movement between pools. Seasonal high flow velocities likely increase passive movement downstream and reduce movement upstream. Results indicate that crayfish mainly spread downstream from a point of colonization and are restricted in their movement to adjacent upstream sections by both natural and artificial barriers. We suggest management … 
Paul Wilson|Selection for pollination success and the mechanical fit of Impatiens flowers around bumblebee bodies|Paul Wilson|1995/8/1|Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|55|4|355-383|Oxford University Press|Selection on flowers has often been viewed as being particularly strict, constant, and responsible for species differences. Impatiens pallida and I. capensis flowers fit snugly around bees, leading one to expect a close relationship between floral morphology and pollination success. My studies on the amount of pollen removed from androecia and deposited on stigmas in single visits by bumblebees did not confirm this supposition. Trimming off parts of the floral vestibule with scissors and gluing in pleats had very little effect on die amount of pollen that bees moved. In reciprocal transfer experiments, flowers from different populations sometimes differed in the amount of pollen moved, but when the two species were compared in sympatry, pollen removal and deposition differed hardly at all. A comparison of the relationship between pollen movement and floral morphology among 15 populations showed that … 
Paul Wilson|Shifts between bee and bird pollination in Penstemons|Paul Wilson, Maria Clara Castellanos, Andrea D Wolfe, James D Thomson|2006|Plant–pollinator interactions: from specialization to generalization|||47-68|University of Chicago Press|This is a story about change and lack of change. The subjects are penstemons. The ﬂowers of certain closely related penstemons differ dramatically, whereas certain distantly related species are eerily similar. This is due to the repeated evolution of hummingbird pollination from bee pollination. Our chapter explores the biology surrounding these evolutionary shifts. We start by deﬁning some useful shorthand. We construe “penstemons” to include the genus Penstemon and closely related genera, particularly Keckiella, a genus that has both bee-and bird-pollinated species. By “bees” we mean the superfamily Apoidea plus (improperly) the wasp Pseudomasaris vespoides, which forages like a bee and like a bee rears its young on pollen. We use “bee-ﬂowers,”“bird-ﬂowers,” and “pollination syndromes” to refer to species on one side or another of a pollinator shift. The degree to which a shift from bees to birds has occurred varies from case to case, and, in general, the notion of pollination syndromes tends to have unfortunate typological connotations (Armbruster et al. 2000; Thomson et al. 2000; Fenster et al. 2004; Waser, chap. 1 in this volume). By choosing penstemons, we focus on bilaterally symmetrical, nototribically pollinated ﬂowers with deeply recessed nectaries capable of quickly replenishing nectar after it has been removed; on ﬂowers that often bloom late in the season, when pollinators are generally abundant and hungry; and on plants that have diversiﬁed in patchy continental habitats. No doubt, the evolutionary dynamics are quite different for other kinds of ﬂowers in other circumstances, and comparison of evolutionary dynamics among … 
Paul Wilson|On inferring hybridity from morphological intermediacy|Paul Wilson|1992/2/1|Taxon|||11-23|International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature|The type of intermediacy that separates hybridity from divergence is not multivariate intermediacy; it is the coincidence of intermediate character states. For the purpose of showing hybridity, analyses should distinguish between the two types of intermediacy. (1) Hybrid indices fail to do so. (2) Principal components analysis does so only in an ambiguous way. (3) Pictorialized scatter diagrams properly present the evidence for an interpretation that is intuitive. (4) Counting characters as intermediate or not-intermediate is an explicit approach that allows for statistical evaluation given that certain assumptions are made. Simulated data representing hybridity and divergence are presented to illustrate each method and to provide a prototype of how to document hybridity using the favored methods. 
Paul Wilson|Constrained lability in floral evolution: counting convergent origins of hummingbird pollination in Penstemon and Keckiella|Paul Wilson, Andrea D Wolfe, W Scott Armbruster, James D Thomson|2007/12|New Phytologist|176|4|883-890|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|•  In the clade of Penstemon and segregate genera, pollination syndromes are well defined among the 284 species. Most display combinations of floral characters associated with pollination by Hymenoptera, the ancestral mode of pollination for this clade. Forty‐one species present characters associated with hummingbird pollination, although some of these ornithophiles are also visited by insects. •  The ornithophiles are scattered throughout the traditional taxonomy and across phylogenies estimated from nuclear (internal transcribed spacer (ITS)) and chloroplast DNA (trnCD/TL) sequence data. Here, the number of separate origins of ornithophily is estimated, using bootstrap phylogenies and constrained parsimony searches. •  Analyses suggest 21 separate origins, with overwhelming support for 10 of these. Because species sampling was incomplete, this is … 
Paul Wilson|Anther evolution: pollen presentation strategies when pollinators differ|Maria Clara Castellanos, Paul Wilson, Sarah J Keller, Andrea D Wolfe, James D Thomson|2005/12/12|The American Naturalist|167|2|288-296|The University of Chicago Press|Male-male competition in plants is thought to exert selection on flower morphology and on the temporal presentation of pollen. Theory suggests that a plant’s pollen dosing strategy should evolve to match the abundance and pollen transfer efficiency of its pollinators. Simultaneous pollen presentation should be favored when pollinators are infrequent or efficient at delivering the pollen they remove, whereas gradual dosing should optimize delivery by frequent and wasteful pollinators. Among Penstemon and Keckiella species, anthers vary in ways that affect pollen release, and the morphology of dried anthers reliably indicates how they dispense pollen. In these genera, hummingbird pollination has evolved repeatedly from hymenopteran pollination. Pollen production does not change with evolutionary shifts between pollinators. We show that after we control for phylogeny, hymenopteran-adapted species present … 
Paul Wilson|Floral constancy in bumble bees: handling efficiency or perceptual conditioning?|Paul Wilson, Melissa Stine|1996/6/1|Oecologia|106|4|493-499|Springer-Verlag|Individual bees often prefer flowers of the same species that they are already foraging on, and other individual bees prefer other flowers. This “floral constancy” has classically been explained as a learned behavior by which bees avoid wasting time switching between handling techniques. Choice trails were given to Bombus vagans workers that were freely foraging in mixed and pure fields of Trifolium pratense, T. repens, Viccia cracca, and Prunella vulgaris. Contrary to expectation, (1) bees showed if anything a stronger preference for their flower type in pure fields where they lacked experience than in a mixed field where they had had the opportunity to learn, (2) there was greater constancy in a mixed field of the two morphologically similar Trifolium species than in a mixed field of the morphologically disparate T. pratense and P. vulgaris, and (3) bees were more willing to switch between flowers of distinct … 
Paul Wilson|The radiation of Calochortus: generalist flowers moving through a mosaic of potential pollinators|James D Dilley, Paul Wilson, Michael R Mesler|2000/5|Oikos|89|2|209-222|Munksgaard|Few studies have surveyed the insects visiting flowers at many sites and for many related species. Calochortus, a genus of about 60 species with its center of diversity in California, has flowers with a wide range of appearances. Insects visiting Calochortus flowers in 25 species were censused at 40 sites. Visitors at coflowering plants were also censused at each site. Calochortus flowers attracted insects in several orders, especially beetles that feed at glands on the petals and bees that often collect pollen. Species in Calochortus section Calochortus had a somewhat narrower spectrum of visitors than species in section Mariposa. The diversity of visitor species at Mariposa flowers was often greater than the diversity at coflowering species. On the whole, Calochortus flowers seem to be generalists in terms of their pollinators. Differences in visitor assemblage were greater between Calochortus populations at … 
Paul Wilson|Factors limiting hybridization between Penstemon spectabilis and Penstemon centranthifolius|Jeannie Chari, Paul Wilson|2001/12/1|Canadian Journal of Botany|79|12|1439-1448|NRC Research Press|Speciation involves the formation of reproductive isolating mechanisms such as a difference in pollinators, incompatibility between pollen tubes and stylar tissue, hybrid seed abortion, or poor growth of hybrid seedlings. We studied reproductive isolating mechanisms in naturally sympatric populations of Penstemon spectabilis Thurber and Penstemon centranthifolius (Benth.) Benth. where F1 hybrids occurred at very low frequency. We compared conspecific crosses, backcrosses, and heterospecific crosses in terms of pollen grain germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, seed set, and offspring performance. We found several postpollination barriers to hybridization. When P. spectabilis was the ovule parent, the lack of natural hybridization was partially explained by the presence of two isolating factors: reduced pollen tube growth and reduced seed set. When P. centranthifolius was the recipient, the barrier to … 
Paul Wilson|Reproductive biology of the monoecious clonal shrub Taxus canadensis|Paul Wilson, Michelle Buonopane, Taber D Allison|1996/1/1|Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|||7-15|Torrey Botanical Club|Strobilus production, pollination, and maturation were studied in Taxus canadensis, a procumbent clonally-spreading shrub. Plants that produced many cones had greater shoot growth; no obvious tradeoff between sexual effort and vegetative growth was observed T. canadensis is monoecious, but plants showed considerable variation in phenotypic gender. Because related species are dioecious, we hypothesize that T. canadensis evolved from a dioecious ancestor. Monoecy may have been favored as a means of assuring pollination via selfing; the proportion of ovules pollinated was positively correlated with the number of male cones on a plant. Selfing may be at the cost of inbreeding depression; 26% of the female cones aborted, about twice the percentage of the dioecious Taxus cuspidata. Application of nutrient fertilizer did not reduce the abortion percentage. Seed and aril maturation in T. canadensis … 
Paul Wilson|Variation in the intensity of pollination in Drosera tracyi: Selection is strongest when resources are intermediate|Paul Wilson|1995/7/1|Evolutionary Ecology|9|4|382-396|Kluwer Academic Publishers|I propose that the strength of selection is greatest when resource levels are intermediate. This idea was partially tested using artificial character variation for petal size inDrosera tracyi. This plant opens one flower each morning, with stigmas becoming available and pollen being presented simultaneously throughout the population. Bees remove all the pollen that can be removed and deposit all the pollen that can be deposited in one or two visits. Visitation rates track blooming density, as do pollen removal and deposition. I measured selection as the difference in pollen removal and deposition between flowers with trimmed petals versus flowers with normal petals. In one meadow, I found a wide range of levels of pollination and corresponding levels of selection, and selection was strongest at intermediate levels of pollination. This might mean that organisms are adapted to conditions when resources are at …

Paul Wilson|Physiological benefits as precursors of sociality: why banded geckos band|Jennifer R Lancaster, Paul Wilson, Robert E Espinoza|2006/7/1|Animal Behaviour|72|1|199-207|Academic Press|Aggregating has been widely studied in a variety of animals and found to have important benefits in terms of sociality, courtship, predator avoidance and physiology. Several species of nocturnal geckos form diurnal aggregations; however, little is known about the benefits of these groupings. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the benefit of aggregation for the desert-dwelling western banded gecko, Coleonyx variegatus. We found that banded geckos benefit from aggregation by a reduction in evaporative water loss (EWL). No social or mating benefits were detected, and geckos did not group to avoid predators. Geckos did not select diurnal retreat sites based solely on the scent of conspecifics, although they aggregated readily when conspecifics were present. Thus, C. variegatus appear to achieve physiological but not social benefits from grouping. Banded geckos belong to an ancestrally tropical …

A hypothesized outcome of autogenic feedbacks is a strong association among spatial variations in vegetation composition, WTD and microtopography. We tested and corroborated this hypothesis using fine spatial scale (<2 × 2 m2) data from two 20 × 20 m2 plots at Mer Bleue, a temperate bog. Furthermore, we partitioned the spatial variation of plant communities into portions explained by WTD as well as fine‐scale and broad‐scale spatial structures using distance‐based Moran's eigenvector maps. We hypothesized that plant distributions are more strongly related to WTD than to microtopography and found that this hypothesis was supported in only one of the two sampled plots …

The local habitat preferences of 282 species were described in terms of wetness, elevation, soil, and amount of shade. The size and centre of the geographic range for each species were determined from regional floras. Results  Wetness preference within the watershed was significantly correlated with range … 
Paul Wilson|Hybrid intermediacy between pollination syndromes in Penstemon, and the role of nectar in affecting hummingbird visitation|Paul Wilson, Elizabeth Anne Jordan|2009/3/2|Botany|87|3|272-282||Flower size dimensions, colour, and nectar quantities potentially account for differences in pollinator species between Penstemon centranthifolius (Benth.) Benth. (tubular, red, nectar-rich, hummingbird pollinated) and Penstemon spectabilis Thurber (wide, purple, nectar-poor, hymenopteran pollinated). For this study, floral characters and pollinator attraction were measured for the two species, F1 hybrids, and backcrosses. Floral dimensions, nectar characters, and color spectra combined in the hybrids in a largely linear fashion, consistent with an interpretation of net additive gene expression. In other words, the changes from one pollination syndrome to another appeared to be quantitative. There were some deviations from linearity, but not so much as to obscure the linear effect. Generally, backcrosses were not more variable than F1 hybrids or pure parents. Hummingbirds preferred P. centranthifolius over P … 
Paul Wilson|Niches of common bryophytes in a semi-arid landscape|Tarja Sagar, Paul Wilson|2009/3|The Bryologist|112|1|30-42|American Bryological and Lichenological Society|The Santa Monica Mountains, adjacent to the Pacific Ocean just west of Los Angeles, California, have low elevation, high relief and a Mediterranean climate. To date 122 species of bryophytes have been found, especially in the moist drainages. Species that were common (about half of the 122) were compared in terms of microhabitat variables (substrate softness, moisture, slope and shadiness) and in how they distinguished mesosites (varying vascular vegetation types, elevation, parent rock type, distance to the coast and insolation). This constitutes a descriptive comparison of the ecologies of the species in the flora. Acrocarpous mosses, pleurocarpous mosses and liverworts tended as groups to differ in some habitat preferences. Only a few bryophyte species were strong indicators of vascular vegetation type. The diversity of sampled mesosites was to a great extent explicable as a scaling-up of the variety of … 
Paul Wilson|The east-facing flowers of Drosera tracyi|Paul Wilson|1994/4/1|American Midland Naturalist|||366-369|University of Notre Dame|Drosera tracyi, like its sister taxon Drosera filiformis, has inflorescences that face toward the morning sun. When inflorescences were manipulated to face W vs. E, direction had no effect on pollen removal from anthers or pollen deposition on stigmas. Facing the sun, in this case, is best interpreted as an evolutionary anachronism that no longer has a function, at least not for the enhancement of pollination where D. tracyi now grows in the Panhandle of Florida and adjacent states. 
Paul Wilson|Three naturally occurring Penstemon hybrids|Paul Siri Wilson, Michael Valenzuela|2002|||||Western North American Naturalist|Three wild Penstemon hybrids are documented herein: Penstemon clevelandii × spectabilis, P. centranthifolius × spectabilis, and P. centranthifolius × eatonii. Each putative hybrid was compared to its respective parental species using manifold floral and vegetative characters for which the parents differed. For each hybrid hypothesis, characters were counted as being intermediate or not intermediate. There were significantly more intermediate characters in all 3 cases (one-sided sign tests, P < 0.05). These Penstemon species evidently do hybridize naturally, and for nearly all characters the hybrids are consistent with the view that the parents differ largely by additive genetic effects. 
Paul Wilson|Natural hybridization in western gooseberries (Ribes subgenus Grossularia: Grossulariaceae)|Michael R Mesler, R Jane Cole, Paul Wilson|1991/4/1|Madroño|||115-129|California Botanical Society|We describe three cases of hybridization between species of Ribes in the Klamath Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon. Based on their intermediacy and reduced pollen viability, we identified putative hybrids between R. lobbii and R. roezlii var. cruentum, R. binominatum and R. marshallii, and R. binominatum and R. lobbii. The hybrids live in recently cleared forests, where logging created extensive areas suitable for seedling establishment. Even though they are partially fertile, backcrossing and interbreeding have not generated an extensive array of recombinant types. Judging from field observations and surveys of herbarium specimens, hybridization between these species of Ribes appears to be uncommon, and there is little evidence that introgression is blurring the distinctions between them.

Disturbance history may influence subsequent species composition in several ways as disturbance may • alter physical site conditions directly and thereby influence subsequent plant performance and competitive interactions, or change the suite of species that can potentially occupy a site;• allow for the establishment of species that are then able to persist for long periods of time, even on sites where they would, in the absence of disturbance, be unable to establish or compete effectively; or• remove species that are extremely slow to recolonize, even in the absence of altered resource conditions. For instance, plants with slow rates of dispersal or establishment may be absent from a site for decades or centuries, not because the site is unsuitable, but simply because the species was removed by a prior disturbance and has not had sufficient time or opportunity to recolonize. Because species' distribution patterns may be controlled by current environmental conditions and/or historical factors, a major challenge for ecological study is to evaluate the relative influence of these factors on modern vegetation, and to determine how the relative importance of contemporary conditions versus history changes with time since disturbance. 
Paul Wilson|Broyophytes of the Santa Monica Mountains|Paul Siri Wilson, Tarja Sagar|2006|||||Southern California Botanists|A preliminary species list is provided for bryophytes of the Santa Monica Mountains, along with illustrations of representatives of many of the genera to serve as an introductory guide to the group. Presently 109 species of bryophytes are known from the Santa Monica Mountains. This does not count some of the species from difficult genera with many samples of uncertain identification remaining to be studied further. Bryoerythrophyllum ferruginascens (Strit.) Giac. is reported new for California. A comparison of the Santa Monica Mountains bryophyte flora with those of Santa Cruz County, at the same elevation but higher latitude, and Mount San Jacinto, at the same latitude but higher elevation, indicates that the Santa Monica Mountains flora shares more of its species with Santa Cruz County but lacks a great many species that are common in that wetter climate, and that the Santa Monica Mountains flora is remarkably dissimilar in composition to the flora of Mount San Jacinto. 
Paul Wilson|Pollination Syndromes and Floral Specialisation|W Scott Armbruster, Paul Wilson, Michele R Dudash, James D Thomson|2004|Annual review of ecology, evolution, and systematics|35||375-403||Floral evolution has often been associated with differences in pollination syndromes. Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect of their syndromes, and that flowers often seem to diverge without excluding one type of pollinator over another. Nevertheless, the larger framework surrounding pollination syndromes can be revised and extended to account more subtly for many major features of floral evolution that involve specialization onto disparate pollinators. Such evolutionary changes in specialization should be distinguished from the ecological state of specialization, which we define as the contemporary community of floral visitors. Evolutionary specialization appears to have resulted in flowers that possess functionally related complexes of traits that are maintained by stabilizing selection. Each of these traits, in turn, explains different amounts of the variation in plant-pollinator relationships. Floral rewards, in particular, are a critical locus of specialization, but flowers should be considered as complexes of floral traits co-adapted to one another. An appreciation for floral specialization should be balanced by an understanding of the limits to specialization. We hope our critique contributes to the ongoing renaissance in studies of floral adaptations. 
Paul Wilson|Rarity as a life‐history correlate in Dudleya (Crassulaceae)|Ann E Dorsey, Paul Wilson|2011/7|American journal of botany|98|7|1104-1112|Botanical Society of America|• Premise of the study: Differences in rarity among species can be caused by adaptation to local conditions along with correlated evolution in characters that limit geographic range size. For this kind of divergence, the resulting species differ in their ability to thrive in varying environments. Because rare species are more prone to extinction than widespread species, trade‐offs in life history predispose the resulting lineages to clade selection. • Methods: Nine Dudleya species live in the Santa Monica Mountains: five neoendemics, one species intermediate in rarity, and three with broader ranges. Life‐history traits were correlated against one another. To understand habitat dependence, the species were grown in an inland garden and in a coastal garden, and the disparity in growth and reproduction in the two gardens was compared among species. • Key results: Rare species reproduced earlier and grew to be smaller … 
Paul Wilson|The Insects That Visit Penstemon Flowers|Sarah Kimball, Paul Wilson|2009|Bull. of The Am. Penstemon Soc|68||20-45||The shape and color of penstemon flowers are the result of adaptations to attract pollinators. Diverse flower types reflect differences in animal pollinators. For about four-fifths of penstemon species (the ones with white, blue, or purple flowers), the principal pollinators are bees and the wasp Pseudomasaris vespoides. The remaining fifth of penstemon species have red or pink flowers adapted to hummingbird pollination, with some of these also retaining the bees as co-pollinators. In addition to the animals that the flowers seem adapted to, there are a number of other insects that sometimes visit penstemon flowers, such as the long-tongued flies called Oligodranes. There are also many generalist flower visitors occasionally observed on penstemons, such as hawkmoths. The hummingbirds visiting penstemon can be identified with field guides, but the insect visitors are usually more difficult because there are many more insect species and few field guides mention the flowers visited by each species. The goal of this article is to introduce some of the major groups of insects commonly observed visiting penstemon flowers (see photographs in Plate 9). Animal pollinators visit flowers to gather food in the form of nectar, pollen, or both. From the perspective of the animal pollinators, the act of removing pollen from the anthers of one flower and depositing it on the stigma of another flower is merely a 
Paul Wilson|Hummingbirds at artificial flowers made to resemble ornithophiles versus melittophiles|Paul Siri Wilson, Wyndee A Guzman|2012|||||Journal of Pollination Ecology|Certain floral characteristics are associated with specific pollinators. Hummingbird-pollinated flowers are usually red, lack a landing platform, lack nectar guides, and contain a high amount of dilute sucrose-rich nectar. Here we test hypotheses concerning the reasons for these characters to the extent that they involve hummingbird responses. An array was set up of 16 artificial plants, each with five artificial flowers. (1) Flowers made to differ only in colour elicited a slight preference for red. (2) When colour was associated with nectar offerings, and birds generally learned to visit flowers that provided much more nectar but did not associatively learn differences as little as 2 μL. (3) Birds were offered 8 μL of 12% sucrose versus 2 μL of 48% hexose, and they did not prefer the dilute nectar; they showed no evidence of discerning sucrose from hexose; however, they preferred 48% over 12% sucrose when both were offered in the same quantity. (4) Birds preferred flowers that lacked landing platforms over those with landing platforms. (5) Birds were offered flowers with nectar guides, associated with differing nectar volumes, and they did not associate the higher nectar reward with either flower type. In summary, the feedback from hummingbirds reflects some of the differences between bird- and bee-adapted flowers, but nectar seemed less predictive than expected. Factors other than the behavioural proclivities of hummingbirds, such as adaptation to discourage bees, are discussed as additional causes for the differences between the syndromes. We also discuss significance testing for field experiments involving one unreplicated array. 
Paul Wilson|A test of density-dependent pollination within three populations of endangered Pentachaeta lyonii.|Jocelyn R Holt, Paul Wilson, Christy A Brigham|2014/1/1|Journal of Pollination Ecology|12||||A major concern with endangered plants is that they might attract insufficient numbers of pollinators, produce low numbers of seeds, and decline towards extinction. We examined effects of density as it varied within populations on the pollination of Pentachaeta lyonii, an endangered species that requires pollinators for seed set. Generalist bee-flies and bees were abundant pollinators at three sites for two years. Per-capita visitation rates did not decline at sparse points or for plants placed on the order of 10 m away from other flowering individuals. Seed production was not pollinator-limited within patches, but seed set was low beyond 10 m from neighbours. Considering prior findings, factors such as habitat loss, competition with alien plants, and poor establishment of new populations likely contribute to the rarity of P. lyonii more than pollination failure.

Paul Wilson|Lack of evolution in a leaf beetle that lives on two contrasting host plants|Katherine Gould, Paul Wilson|2015/9|Ecology and evolution|5|18|3905-3913||The interactions between plant‐eating insects and their hosts have shaped both the insects and the plants, driving evolution of plant defenses and insect specialization. The leaf beetle Trirhabda eriodictyonis (Chrysomelidae) lives on two shrubs with differing defenses: Eriodictyon crassifolium has hairy leaves, whereas E. trichocalyx has resinous leaves. We tested whether these beetles have differentiated onto the two host plants, and if not, whether the beetles prefer the better host plant and prefer mates who are from that host plant. In feeding tests, adult beetles strongly preferred eating E. trichocalyx regardless of which host they came from. In addition, females laid more eggs if they ate E. trichocalyx than E. crassifolium. So, E. trichocalyx is generally the better host. However, beetle mate preference was not in line with food choice. Males did not prefer to mate with females from E. trichocalyx. Females from E …

Many are restricted to narrow geographic ranges with closely related forms living in differing climates. Previously, we found an intriguing set of correlations among nine more or less sympatric Dudleya: species with a smaller mature body size had a lower tolerance for an arid inland climate compared to larger bodied species. Thus, we were motivated to test for rules caused by convergent evolution. We sampled 20 populations from locations across much of the range of the genus. The 20 populations were placed into 10 pairs of close relatives. For each pair, one form was judged to be more mesophilic and the other to be more xerophilic, based on climate-of-origin. We measured germination rate, survival through the summer drought in a coastal garden, and survival through the summer in an inland garden. We hypothesized (among other things) that the …

Paul Wilson|Relationships among the water table depth, water and surface elevations, and the composition of vegetation in a temperate hummocky, ombrogenic, oligotrophic raised shrub bog|Nigel Roulet, Paul Wilson, Avni Malhora|2016/4||18||||Microtopography, such as hummocks and hollows, pools, ridges and lawns are features that are believed to be a consequence of feedbacks among the local hydrology and the production and decomposition of organic material. To deductively test some of the postulates derived from several theoretical studies of the development of patterning on peatlands, over two consecutive years we examined the spatial and temporal relationships among the hummock-hollow microtopography, water table depths (WTD) and water elevations (WTE) in a raised, ombrotrophic bog (Mer Bleue, Canada) that has extensive and well developed microtopography. In each of two 20 x 20 m plots we measured the surface elevation at more than 1,000 points, the WTDs manually every two to three weeks at 100 wells located on a 2 x 2 m grid, and WTDs continuously at more than 20 sites at adjacent hummocks and hollows. In addition to the … 
Paul Wilson|Campus Conifers|Paul Wilson|2015/6/24|||||California State University, Northridge|Hello students. This is non-flowering plants. You are in front of a young Sequoiadendron. This Genus has only two known species, only one being extant. Sequoiadendron chaneyi went extinct 5-12 MYA. The earliest of these lived lakeside in the area of what is now Nevada. They were particularly abundant in North-facing forests. From there, a series of storms likely carried the seeds to the Alpine Region of California, where only a few fossilized specimen have been found. A direct descendant of this species is Sequoiadendron giganteum. This species is commonly known as the Giant Sequoia or Giant Redwood. The most notable feature of this plant is certainly its size; These are the largest trees by trunk volume and mass known. The biggest trees are estimated to be somewhat over 6,000 tons. They are quite tall, a specimen is recorded as 360 feet high. By comparison, that is taller than the Statue of Liberty. As trees grow taller, their lower branches die readily from shading. It takes quite some time to grow this mass. One tree is estimated to be about 3,300 years old. However, each living cell in the tree is no greater than a few decades old. These trees are constantly growing new, living cells over dead interiors. The wood of the Sequoiadedron is relatively resistant to decay, but it is not uncommon for the dead interior to rot away, leaving trees hollow. There are obstacles with being so big. Water movement in tall vascular plants typically relies on a pressure gradient. Sequoiadendron giganteum has suspended aerial roots to absorb water from the fog around their crowns. Leaves are awl-shaped and arranged spirally on shoots. The trees are …

Many hours were spent smoothing out the logistics with my advisor, Dr. Mark Steele, and numerous experts in the field of study. What did I want to study, you ask? Fish, of course. And the one I chose is endangered. Everyone wants to work on an endangered species, right? I quickly learned why it is so difficult to do so. Before starting my research, I had to obtain seven permits, clearance at two military bases, and approval to collect on private property from a cowboy that had a large number of cattle. 
Paul Wilson|Macroevolution for plant reproductive biologists|Paul Wilson|2011/12/8|Evolution of Plant-Pollinator Relationships|81||1|Cambridge University Press|Just as there is a microevolutionary process that explains organismal adaptations, so is there a macroevolutionary process that explains biological diversity. Consider western North America’s wildflowers. How is it that there are 246 penstemons that are hymenopteran pollinated, and 40 penstemons that have taken on hummingbirds, but no penstemon species has adapted to fly or butterfly or beetle pollination? How is it that there are 60 kinds of dudleyas, all with ranges emanating from the coastal mountains? And how about mariposa lilies, a group of35 species varying in flower colors and petal hairs yet all pollinated by both beetles and bees via a highly generalized floral mechanism? The amounts of diversity and the patterns in which they are arranged are the products of a macroevolutionary process. The microevolutionary process is more familiar. Mutations occur from time to time. They are undirected. Many are deleterious to the functioning ofthe organism in its environment. For a while they contribute to the genetic load, then eventually they are lost due to natural selection. Many other mutations are neutral or nearly neutral given the environment where the organism lives and the genetic state of the organism at other loci. Neutral alleles change in frequency due to genetic drift. A few new mutations are beneficial to the individuals that carry them, or to

Baird et al (2009) discuss the issues of simulating methane emissions from northern peatlands caused by the scales of peatland topography and hydrology. Methane emissions can vary as much as 4 orders of magnitude over linear scales of< 1 to~ 1,000 m. These scales are too fine to be captured in contemporary ecosystem models. However, there are relationships among methane emissions, peatland topography and moisture, and vegetation communities (PFTs) that could be used to capture smaller scale variability. We are exploring these relationships across micro-to mesotopographic scales to see if there are transferable statistical descriptions that could be used to incorporate the spatial non-linearity of methane emissions in coarser scale ecosystem models. We have … 
Paul Wilson|Spatio/temporal Variability of Water Table at a Boreal Peatland and the Potential for the Application of Remote Sensing|P Wilson, NT Roulet, R Touzi, NJ Shatilla|2011/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Peatland ecosystems store an estimated 30% of global terrestrial carbon, and recent studies at the Mer Bleue research site (45.40 N, 75.50 W) have indicated that changes in water storage affects fluxes in carbon in and out of the peatland. The depth of the water table is an excellent indicator of moisture storage in ombrotrophic bogs like Mer Bleue, and the depth of this saturation boundary affect the peatland's major carbon pathways. The surface micro-topography at Mer Bleue follows a distinct hummock-hollow pattern, with elevation differences between these two types of features of up to 30 cm over a distance of 1-2 metres. 3 transects containing 4-7 automatic capacitative data loggers were established in two instrumentation plots, continuously recording water levels every 15 minutes.

Paul Wilson|The role of patterning in peatland water table fluctuations and carbon exchange|P Wilson, N Shatilla, NT Roulet|2010/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Peatlands store 30% of global terrestrial organic carbon. At the Mer Bleue research site in southern Canada (45.40 N, 75.50 W), it has been shown that changes in water storage affect carbon fluxes in and out of the peatland. The water table is an indicator of moisture storage in the bog and it influences the four carbon pathways that make up the Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance (NECB): dissolved organic carbon, gross primary productivity, respiration (aerobic and anaerobic) and methane production, oxidation and transport. Mer Bleue has a distinct hummock-hollow surface topography. The micro-topographical features affect the temporal and spatial variations in water table.

After passing the national college admission exam, he was assigned to go to Hunan Teachers’ College in Changsha to study biology. At the time biology was his least favorite subject.“During that period in China, being accepted into a four-year college was a bigger deal for a farmer’s child than you might think.

Paul Wilson|Anther evolution: pollen presentation strategies|Paul Siri Wilson, Maria Clara Castellanos, Sarah J Keller, James D Thomson, Andrea D Wolfe|2005|||||The American Naturalist|Male-male competition in plants is thought to exert selection on flower morphology and on the temporal presentation of pollen. Theory suggests that a plant's pollen dosing strategy should evolve to match the abundance and pollen transfer efficiency of its pollinators. Simultaneous pollen presentation should be favored when pollinators are infrequent or efficient at delivering the pollen they remove, whereas gradual dosing should optimize delivery by frequent and wasteful pollinators. Among Penstemon and Keckiella species, anthers vary in ways that affect pollen release, and the morphology of dried anthers reliably indicates how they dispense pollen. In these genera, hummingbird pollination has evolved repeatedly from hymenopteran pollination. Pollen production does not change with evolutionary shifts between pollinators. We show that after we control for phylogeny, hymenopteran-adapted species present their pollen more gradually than hummingbird-adapted relatives. In a species pair that seemed to defy the pattern, the rhythm of anther maturation produced an equivalent dosing effect. These results accord with previous findings that hummingbirds can be more efficient than bees at delivering pollen.

Based on their intermediacy and reduced pollen viability, we identified putative hybrids between R. lobbii and R. roezlii var. cruentum, R. binominatum and R. marshallii, and R. binominatum and R. lobbii. The hybrids live in recently cleared forests, where logging created extensive areas suitable for seedling establishment. Even though they are partially fertile, backcrossing and interbreeding have not generated an extensive array of recombinant types. Judging from field observations and surveys of herbarium specimens, hybridization between these species of Ribes appears to be uncommon, and there is little evidence that introgression is blurring the distinctions between them.

Jeremy Yoder|Ecological opportunity and the origin of adaptive radiations|JB Yoder, E Clancey, S Des Roches, JM Eastman, L Gentry, W Godsoe, TJ Hagey, D Jochimsen, BP Oswald, J Robertson, BAJ Sarver, JJ Schenk, SF Spear, LJ Harmon|2010/8/1|Journal of Evolutionary Biology|23|8|1581-1596|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Ecological opportunity – through entry into a new environment, the origin of a key innovation or extinction of antagonists – is widely thought to link ecological population dynamics to evolutionary diversification. The population‐level processes arising from ecological opportunity are well documented under the concept of ecological release. However, there is little consensus as to how these processes promote phenotypic diversification, rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. We propose that ecological opportunity could promote adaptive radiation by generating specific changes to the selective regimes acting on natural populations, both by relaxing effective stabilizing selection and by creating conditions that ultimately generate diversifying selection. We assess theoretical and empirical evidence for these effects of ecological opportunity and review emerging phylogenetic approaches that attempt to detect the … 
Jeremy Yoder|Dos and don'ts of testing the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution|Richard Gomulkiewicz, Devin M Drown, Mark F Dybdahl, William Godsoe, Scott L Nuismer, Kim M Pepin, Benjamin J Ridenhour, Christopher I Smith, Jeremy B Yoder|2007/5||98|5|249|Nature Publishing Group|The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is stimulating much new research on interspecific interactions. We provide a guide to the fundamental components of the theory, its processes and main predictions. Our primary objectives are to clarify misconceptions regarding the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution and to describe how empiricists can test the theory rigorously. In particular, we explain why confirming the three main predicted empirical patterns (spatial variation in traits mediating interactions among species, trait mismatching among interacting species and few species-level coevolved traits) does not provide unequivocal support for the theory. We suggest that strong empirical tests of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution should focus on its underlying processes: coevolutionary hot and cold spots, selection mosaics and trait remixing. We describe these processes and discuss potential ways … 
Jeremy Yoder|When does coevolution promote diversification?|Jeremy B Yoder, Scott L Nuismer|2010/10/15|The American Naturalist|176|6|802-817|The University of Chicago Press|Coevolutionary interactions between species are thought to be an important cause of evolutionary diversification. Despite this general belief, little theoretical basis exists for distinguishing between the types of interactions that promote diversification and those types that have no effect or that even restrict it. Using analytical models and simulations of phenotypic evolution across a metapopulation, we show that coevolutionary interactions promote diversification when they impose a cost of phenotype matching, as is the case for competition or host-parasite antagonism. In contrast, classical coevolutionary arms races have no tendency to promote or inhibit diversification, and mutualistic interactions actually restrict diversification. Together with the results of recent phylogenetic and ecological studies, these results suggest that the causes of diversification in many coevolutionary systems may require reassessment. 
Jeremy Yoder|Genomic signature of adaptation to climate in Medicago truncatula|Jeremy B Yoder, John Stanton-Geddes, Peng Zhou, Roman Briskine, Nevin D Young, Peter Tiffin|2014/4|Genetics|196|4|1263-1275|Genetics Society of America|Local adaptation and adaptive clines are pervasive in natural plant populations, yet the effects of these types of adaptation on genomic diversity are not well understood. With a data set of 202 accessions of Medicago truncatula genotyped at almost 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, we used mixed linear models to identify candidate loci responsible for adaptation to three climatic gradients—annual mean temperature (AMT), precipitation in the wettest month (PWM), and isothermality (ITH)—representing the major axes of climate variation across the species’ range. Loci with the strongest association to these climate gradients tagged genome regions with high sequence similarity to genes with functional roles in thermal tolerance, drought tolerance, or resistance to herbivores of pathogens. Genotypes at these candidate loci also predicted the performance of an independent sample of plant accessions grown …

To date, GWAS have generally relied on relatively sparse sampling of nucleotide diversity, which is likely to bias results by preferentially sampling high-frequency SNPs not in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causative SNPs. To avoid these limitations we conducted GWAS with >6 million SNPs identified by sequencing the genomes of 226 accessions of the model legume Medicago truncatula. We used these data to identify candidate genes and the genetic architecture underlying phenotypic variation in plant height, trichome density, flowering time, and nodulation. The characteristics of candidate SNPs differed among traits, with candidates for flowering time and trichome density in distinct clusters of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of candidates underlying variation in flowering time and height significantly greater than MAF of candidates underlying variation in other traits. Candidate SNPs tagged several characterized genes including nodulation related genes SERK2, MtnodGRP3, MtMMPL1, NFP, CaML3, MtnodGRP3A and flowering time gene MtFD as well as uncharacterized genes that become candidates for further molecular characterization. By comparing sequence-based candidates to candidates identified by in silico 250K SNP arrays, we provide an empirical example of how reliance on even high-density reduced representation genomic makers can bias GWAS results. Depending on the trait, only 30–70% of the top 20 in silico array candidates were within 1 kb of sequence-based … 
Jeremy Yoder|Distinguishing coevolution from covicariance in an obligate pollination mutualism: asynchronous divergence in Joshua tree and its pollinators|Christopher Irwin Smith, William KW Godsoe, Shantel Tank, Jeremy B Yoder, Olle Pellmyr|2008/10|Evolution: International Journal of Organic Evolution|62|10|2676-2687|Blackwell Publishing Inc|Obligate pollination mutualisms‐–in which both plants and their pollinators are reliant upon one another for reproduction‐–represent some of the most remarkable coevolutionary interactions in the natural world. The intimacy and specificity of these interactions have led to the prediction that the plants and their pollinators may be prone to cospeciation driven by coevolution. Several studies have identified patterns of phylogenetic congruence that are consistent with this prediction, but it is difficult to determine the evolutionary process that underlies these patterns. Phylogenetic congruence might also be produced by extrinsic factors, such as a shared biogeographic history. We examine the biogeographic history of a putative case of codivergence in the obligate pollination mutualism between Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) and two sister species of pollinating yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) We employ molecular … 
Jeremy Yoder|Coevolution and divergence in the Joshua tree/yucca moth mutualism|William Godsoe, Jeremy B Yoder, Christopher Irwin Smith, Olle Pellmyr|2008/4/4|The American Naturalist|171|6|816-823|The University of Chicago Press|Theory suggests that coevolution drives diversification in obligate pollination mutualism, but it has been difficult to disentangle the effects of coevolution from other factors. We test the hypothesis that differential selection by two sister species of pollinating yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) drove divergence between two varieties of the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) by comparing measures of differentiation in floral and vegetative features. We show that floral features associated with pollination evolved more rapidly than vegetative features extrinsic to the interaction and that a key floral feature involved in the mutualism is more differentiated than any other and matches equivalent differences in the morphology of the pollinating moths. A phylogenetically based, ancestral states reconstruction shows that differences in moth morphology arose in the time since they first became associated with Joshua trees. These results …

We used this data set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Medicago species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in … 
Jeremy Yoder|Coevolution and the diversification of life|David H Hembry, Jeremy B Yoder, Kari Roesch Goodman|2014/8/18|The American Naturalist|184|4|425-438|University of Chicago Press|Coevolution, reciprocal adaptation between two or more taxa, is commonly invoked as a primary mechanism responsible for generating much of Earth’s biodiversity. This conceptually appealing hypothesis is incredibly broad in evolutionary scope, encompassing diverse patterns and processes operating over timescales ranging from microbial generations to geological eras. However, we have surprisingly little evidence that large-scale associations between coevolution and diversity reflect a causal relationship at smaller timescales, in which coevolutionary selection is directly responsible for the formation of new species. In this synthesis, we critically evaluate evidence for the often-invoked hypothesis that coevolution is an important process promoting biological diversification. We conclude that the lack of widespread evidence for coevolutionary diversification may be best explained by the fact that coevolution’s …

Jeremy Yoder|Divergence in an obligate mutualism is not explained by divergent climatic factors|William Godsoe, Eva Strand, Christopher Irwin Smith, Jeremy B Yoder, Todd C Esque, Olle Pellmyr|2009/8/1|New Phytologist|183|3|589-599|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|• Adaptation to divergent environments creates and maintains biological diversity, but we know little about the importance of different agents of ecological divergence. Coevolution in obligate mutualisms has been hypothesized to drive divergence, but this contention has rarely been tested against alternative ecological explanations. Here, we use a well-established example of coevolution in an obligate pollination mutualism, Yucca brevifolia and its two pollinating yucca moths, to test the hypothesis that divergence in this system is the result of mutualists adapting to different abiotic environments as opposed to coevolution between mutualists.• We used a combination of principal component analyses and ecological niche modeling to determine whether varieties of Y. brevifolia associated with different pollinators specialize on different environments.• Yucca brevifolia occupies a diverse range of climates.

Mathematical models of coevolution in obligate pollination mutualisms suggest that phenotype matching between plants and their pollinators can generate reproductive isolation. Here, we test this hypothesis using a natural experiment that examines the role of natural selection on phenotype matching between yuccas and yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) in mediating reproductive isolation between two varieties of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia var. brevifolia and Y. brevifolia var. jaegeriana). Using passive monitoring techniques, DNA barcoding, microsatellite DNA genotyping, and sibship reconstruction, we track host specificity and the fitness consequences of host choice in a zone of …

Heritability (h 2) represents the potential for short‐term response of a quantitative trait to selection. Unfortunately, estimating h 2 through traditional crossing experiments is not practical for many species, and even for those in which mating can be manipulated, it may not be possible to assay them in ecologically relevant environments. 
Jeremy Yoder|Asymmetric hybridization and gene flow between Joshua trees (Agavaceae: Yucca) reflect differences in pollinator host specificity|Tyler N Starr, Katherine E Gadek, Jeremy B Yoder, Ramona Flatz, Christopher I Smith|2013/1/1|Molecular Ecology|22|2|437-449||The angiosperms are by far the largest group of terrestrial plants. Their spectacular diversity is often attributed to specialized pollination. Obligate pollination mutualisms where both a plant and its pollinator are dependent upon one another for reproduction are thought to be prone to rapid diversification through co‐evolution and pollinator isolation. However, few studies have evaluated the degree to which pollinators actually mediate reproductive isolation in these systems. Here, we examine evidence for hybridization and gene flow between two subspecies of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia brevifolia and Yucca brevifolia jaegeriana) pollinated by two sister species of yucca moth. Previous work indicated that the pollinators differ in host specificity, and DNA sequence data suggested asymmetric introgression between the tree subspecies. Through intensive sampling in a zone of sympatry, a large number of … 
Jeremy Yoder|Host-associated divergence and incipient speciation in the yucca moth Prodoxus coloradensis (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) on three species of host plants|CS Drummond, HJ Xue, JB Yoder, O Pellmyr|2010/8|Heredity|105|2|183|Nature Publishing Group|A wide range of evolutionary processes have been implicated in the diversification of yuccas and yucca moths, which exhibit ecological relationships that extend from obligate plant–pollinator mutualisms to commensalist herbivory. Prodoxus coloradensis (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) is a yucca moth, which feeds on the flowering stalks of three Yucca species as larvae, but does not provide pollination service. To test for evidence of host-associated speciation, we examined the genetic structure of P. coloradensis using mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1 alpha) DNA sequence data. Multilocus coalescent simulations indicate that moths on different host plant species are characterized by recent divergence and low levels of effective migration, with large effective population sizes and considerable retention of shared ancestral polymorphism. Although geographical distance explains a … 
Jeremy Yoder|Effects of gene flow on phenotype matching between two varieties of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia; Agavaceae) and their pollinators|JB Yoder, CI Smith, DJ Rowley, R Flatz, W Godsoe, C Drummond, O Pellmyr|2013/6/1|Journal of Evolutionary Biology|26|6|1220-1233||In animal‐pollinated plants, local adaptation to pollinator behaviour or morphology can restrict gene flow among plant populations; but gene flow may also prevent divergent adaptation. Here, we examine possible effects of gene flow on plant–pollinator trait matching in two varieties of Joshua tree (Agavaceae: Yucca brevifolia). The two varieties differ in strikingly in floral morphology, which matches differences in the morphology of their pollinators. However, this codivergence is not present at a smaller scale: within the two varieties of Joshua tree, variation in floral morphology between demes is not correlated with differences in moth morphology. We use population genetic data for Joshua tree and its pollinators to test the hypotheses that gene flow between Joshua tree populations is structured by pollinator specificity, and that gene flow within the divergent plant–pollinator associations ‘swamps’ fine‐scale … 
Jeremy Yoder|Absence of population‐level phenotype matching in an obligate pollination mutualism|W Godsoe, JB Yoder, CI Smith, CS Drummond, O Pellmyr|2010/12/1|Journal of Evolutionary Biology|23|12|2739-2746|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Coevolution is thought to promote evolutionary change between demes that ultimately results in speciation. If this is the case, then we should expect to see similar patterns of trait matching and phenotypic divergence between populations and between species in model systems for coevolution. As measures of divergence are frequently only available at one scale (population level or taxon level), this contention is rarely tested directly. Here, we use the case of co‐divergence between different varieties of Joshua tree Yucca brevifolia (Agavaceae) and their obligate pollinators, two yucca moths (Tegeticula spp. Prodoxidae), to test for trait matching between taxa and among populations. Using model selection, we show that there is trait matching between mutualists at the taxon level, but once we account for differences between taxa, there is no indication of trait matching in local populations. This result differs from … 
Jeremy Yoder|How to become a yucca moth: minimal trait evolution needed to establish the obligate pollination mutualism|Jeremy B Yoder, Christopher Irwin Smith, Olle Pellmyr|2010/8/1|Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|100|4|847-855|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|The origins of obligate pollination mutualisms, such as the classic yucca–yucca moth association, appear to require extensive trait evolution and specialization. To understand the extent to which traits truly evolved as part of establishing the mutualistic relationship, rather than being pre-adaptations, we used an expanded phylogenetic estimate with improved sampling of deeply-diverged groups to perform the first formal reconstruction of trait evolution in pollinating yucca moths and their nonpollinating relatives. Our analysis demonstrates that key life-history traits of yucca moths, including larval feeding in the floral ovary and the associated specialized cutting ovipositor, as well as colonization of woody monocots in xeric habitats, may have been established before the obligate mutualism with yuccas. Given these pre-existing traits, novel traits in the mutualist moths are limited to the active pollination behaviours …

Jeremy Yoder|Characterization of microsatellite loci in Yucca brevifolia (Agavaceae) and cross-amplification in related species|Ramona Flatz, Jeremy B Yoder, Edyth Lee-Barnes, Christopher I Smith|2011/3/1|American Journal of Botany|98|3|e67-e69|Botanical Society of America|• Premise of the study: Microsatellite primers were characterized in Yucca brevifolia for use in population genetic studies and, particularly, analyses of gene flow between varieties. • Methods and Results: We characterized 12 microsatellite loci polymorphic in Yucca brevifolia by screening primers that were developed using an SSR‐enriched library or which were previously described in Yucca filamentosa. Genetic analysis of four populations resulted in the mean number of alleles per locus ranging from 10.25 to 14.58 and mean expected heterozygosity from 0.78 to 0.88. Cross‐amplification of all 12 loci was attempted in six additional yucca species. • Conclusions: These loci should prove useful for population genetic research in Yucca brevifolia, and cross‐amplification of these loci in related species suggests that they may be useful in studies of hybridization and introgression between species. 
Jeremy Yoder|Effects of gene action, marker density, and timing of selection on the performance of landscape genomic scans of local adaptation|Jeremy B Yoder, Peter Tiffin|2017/5/8|Journal of Heredity|||||Genomic “scans” to identify loci that contribute to local adaptation are becoming increasingly common. Many methods used for such studies have assumed that local adaptation is created by loci experiencing antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) and that the selected locus itself is assayed, and few consider how signals of selection change through time. However, most empirical data sets have marker density too low to assume that a selected locus itself is assayed, researchers seldom know when selection was first imposed, and many locally adapted loci likely experience not AP but conditional neutrality (CN). We simulated data to evaluate how these factors affect the performance of tests for genotype–environment association (GEA). We found that 3 types of regression-based analyses (linear models, mixed linear models, and latent factor mixed models) and an implementation of BayEnv all performed well, with high … 
Jeremy Yoder|Understanding the coevolutionary dynamics of mutualism with population genomics|Jeremy B Yoder|2016/10/1|American Journal of Botany|103|10|1742-1752|Botanical Society of America|Decades of research on the evolution of mutualism has generated a wealth of possible ways whereby mutually beneficial interactions between species persist in spite of the apparent advantages to individuals that accept the benefits of mutualism without reciprocating — but identifying how any particular empirical system is stabilized against cheating remains challenging. Different hypothesized models of mutualism stability predict different forms of coevolutionary selection, and emerging high‐throughput sequencing methods allow examination of the selective histories of mutualism genes and, thereby, the form of selection acting on those genes. Here, I review the evolutionary theory of mutualism stability and identify how differing models make contrasting predictions for the population genomic diversity and geographic differentiation of mutualism‐related genes. As an example of the possibilities offered by genomic … 
Jeremy Yoder|Sanctions, partner recognition, and variation in mutualism|Jeremy B Yoder, Peter Tiffin|2017/8/23|American Naturalist||||University of Chicago Press|Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by noncooperative individuals by putting such “cheaters” at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality—yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts’ ability to sanction noncooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts’ cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice versa. Individual-based simulations …

Through our analysis, we identified three distinct but related processes of Defining a queer gender and/or sexual identity, Forming an identity as a STEM professional, and Navigating identities at work. We found that heteronormative assumptions frequently silence conversations about gender and sexuality in STEM workplaces and result in complicated negotiations of self for queer professionals.

As a prime example, McKain et al.(2016) report a new, high-confidence resolution of intergeneric relationships within the Agavoideae (Asparagaceae), using new chloroplast genome assemblies for 20 species. The resolved topology and inferred divergence times lend further support for the hypothesis that active, obligate pollination by yucca moths evolved independently in the ancestors of genera Yucca and Hesperoyucca. These genera last shared a common ancestor 18–34 million years ago, McKain et al.(2016) estimate, a period that overlaps with prior estimates for the origin of active pollination by yucca moths (Pellmyr and Leebens-Mack, 1999). If the common ancestor of Yucca and Hesperoyucca was pollinated by yucca moths, however, the topology implies three independent losses of the … 
Jeremy Yoder|The intelligent homosexual's guide to natural selection|Jeremy B. Yoder|2012/9/18||||288|Macmillan|June is Pride Month in the United States, and in communities across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Americans celebrate with carnivals, parades, and marches. Pride is a rebuke to the shame and marginalization many LGBT people face growing up, and a celebration of the freedoms we’ve won since the days when our sexual orientations were considered psychological diseases and grounds for harassment and arrest. It’s also a chance to acknowledge how far we still have to go, and to organize our efforts for a better future. And, of course, it’sa great big party. As an evolutionary biologist, I suspect I have a perspective on the life and history of sexual minorities that many of my fellow partiers don’t. In spite of the progress that LGBT folks have made toward legal equality, there’sa popular perception that we can never really achieve biological equality. This is because same-sex sexual activity is inherently not reproductive sex. To put it baldly, natural selection should be against men who want to have sex with other men, because we aren’t interested in the kind of sex that makes babies. An oft-cited estimate from 1981 is that gay men have about 80 percent fewer children than straight men. Focusing on the selective benefit or detriment associated with particular human traits and behaviors gets my scientific dander up, because it’s so easy for the discussion to slip from what is “selectively beneficial” to what is “right.” A superficial understanding of what natural selection favors or doesn’t favor is a horrible standard for making moral judgments.

Jeremy Yoder|Groundwater Trends in the North Fork Shenandoah River Watershed: Ten Years of Results from the Citizens' Groundwater Monitoring Program|Jeremy B Yoder|2004/9/17||||||Shenandoah County's geology and predominant land uses make its groundwater supply uniquely vulnerable to infiltration by chemical pollutants from non-point sources such as agricultural and residential fertilizers and herbicides. In recognition of this situation, the Friends of the North Fork Shenandoah River (hereafter the Friends) initiated the Citizens' Groundwater Monitoring Program (CGMP) in 1994 to collect samples of water from private wells across the county once a year, and test them for a wide array of parameters, including concentrations of aluminum, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate; pH; and the presence of total coliform, fecal coliform, and E. coli bacteria. In 2004, a decade after CGMP's inception, the Friends were ready to examine the data collected over ten years of well-water sampling for long-term trends as a preliminary step toward reevaluating the program's …

While some marine macroalgae have δ13C values ranging over more than 10‰ within the thallus of an individual (some brown macroalgae), in other cases the range within a species collected over a very wide geographical range is only 5‰ (e.g. the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum which has values between –30 and –35‰). The organisms with very negative δ13C (lower than –30‰) are mainly subtidal red algae, with some intertidal red algae and a few green algae; those with very positive δ13C values (higher than –10‰) are mainly green macroalgae and seagrasses, with some red and brown macroalgae. The δ13C value correlates primarily with taxonomy and secondarily with ecology …

Lyngb., in media aerated with four O2 concentrations between 10 and 200% of current ambient [O2] and four CO2 concentrations between 67 and 500% of current ambient [CO2], in a factorial design, to determine the effects of gas composition on growth and physiology. The relative growth rate of L. articulata increased with increasing [CO2] up to 200% of current ambient [CO2] but was unaffected by [O2]. The relative growth enhancement, on a carbon basis, was 52% with a doubling of [CO2] but fell to 23% under 5× ambient [CO2]. Plants collected in winter responded more extremely to [CO2] than did plants collected in the summer, although the overall pattern was the same. Discrimination between stable carbon isotopes (Δ13C) increased with increasing [CO2] as would be expected for diffusive CO2 acquisition. Tissue C and N were …

Constraints on the ability to grow at very low fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation fall into three categories. Category one includes essential processes whose efficiency is independent of the rate of energy input, but whose catalysts show phylogenetic variation leading to different energy costs for a given process in different taxa, e.g. light-harvesting complexes, RUBISCO and probably in the sensitivity of PsII to photodamage. The second category comprises essential processes whose efficiency decreases with decreasing energy input rate as a result of back-reactions independent of the … 
Janet Kubler|New light on the scaling of metabolic rate with the size of algae|John A Raven, Janet E Kübler|2002/2|Journal of Phycology|38|1|11-16|Blackwell Science, Inc.|The scaling of metabolic rate with the size of algae has been discussed and researched at length. The observation that algae usually have exponents b in the equation R = a·W−b (where R is the specific growth rate, W is the organism [cell] biomass, and a and b are constants) equal to or higher than the value of −0.25 for many other organisms is generally related to resource‐saturated (maximal) values of R. Recent work has shown that the exponent b for light‐limited growth is more negative than −0.25. This was predicted from considerations of the package effect in photon absorption, as modulated by the volume‐specific pigment content of the cells, and the photosynthetic unit size. Further work is needed to extrapolate these findings to fluctuating light environments. This minireview puts the recent work into a broader context and suggests how further work could quantify the roles of optical thickness and of spatial …

However, there have been at least four significant glacial episodes prior to the Pleistocene glaciations. Two of these (approx. 2·1 and 0·7 Ga ago) may have involved a ‘Snowball Earth’ with a very great impact on the algae (sensu lato) of the time (cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta) and especially those that were adapted to warm habitats. By contrast, it is possible that heterokont, dinophyte and haptophyte phototrophs only evolved after the Carboniferous–Permian ice age (approx. 250 Ma ago) and so did not encounter low (≤5 °C) sea surface temperatures until the Antarctic cooled some 15 Ma ago. Despite this, many of … 
Janet Kubler|Consequences of light limitation for carbon acquisition in three rhodophytes|Janet E Kiibler, John A Raven|1994|Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser|110||203-209||We investigated the consequences of growth at Limiting photon flux density (PFD) for the uptake of inorganic carbon by 2 species of red seaweed which are able to use HC 0 3 for photosynthesis [Palmaria palmata (Huds.) Larnour and Laurencia pinnatifida (L.) Kuntze] and one which is dependent on diffusive uptake of bulk CO,[Lomentaria articulata (Huds.) Lyngb.] We attempted to induce energetic limitation of plants and/or reduce their demand for inorganic carbon by growing them at a low PFD and comparing their carbon use characteristics with those of plants grown at high PFD. There were significant increases in the carbon isotope discrimination (more negative delta values relative to the PDB standard) when the 3 species were grown at 25 relative to 75 pm01 photons m-2 S-'. In the 2 species which are able to use bicarbonate, the decreased SI3c was associated with lower initial slopes of inorganic carbon uptake curves. Taken together, the changes in 6I3C and dissolved organic carbon uptake indicated that light-limited P. palmata and L. pinnatifjda were not using low concentrations of inorganic carbon as efficiently as were plants grown at high PFD. This hypothesis was further supported by evidence that light limitation also caused a reduction in C: N ratio and in the% dry matter made up of carbon in those species. In contrast, growth of L. articulata, which is dependent on diffusive uptake of CO, for photosynthesis, was inhibited by the higher PFD and there were no significant effects of growth PFD on inorganic carbon uptake efficiency, C: N ratio or% C in this species.

These measurements revealed 1 specles of green macroalgae and 9 species of red macroalgae with a 6I3C below-30%. These new observations bring the total of reports of wild-collected manne macrophytes with 613C values below-30% to 3 species of ulvophycean chlorophytes and 22 species of florideophycean rhodophytes The 22 rhodophyte species are in 18 genera in 10 famllies of 4 orders. Marine algae with very negative S13C values have been shown in other work to be unable to use HC03-and rely on CO2 diffusion Into the thallus for photosynthesis. The quantitative implications of the low I3C/l2C ratio and the inability to use HCOf were analysed to predict the maximum in situ rate of photosynthesis. The relatively low predicted rates agree with measured rates (by other workers) of C assimilation in photosynthesis and growth. These low potential rates of C acquisition can be related to the low mean photon flux density required for growth in 17 of the 22 species of red algae and all 3 species of green algae. Low mean photon flux densities are characteristic of habitats in the subtidal (18 species of red algae, 3 species of green algae) and shaded microhabitats in the intertidal (1 species of red algae). Even the 5 other algae, littoral and infralittoral, seem from the literature to have low photosynthetic and relative growth rates, although it is not clear whether the low metabolic rates result from dependence on CO …

Ascophyllum nodosum dominates the mid‐intertidal zone of sheltered rocky shores in the north‐west Atlantic, and populations often consist of large, mature individuals and few newly recruited thalli. 2  We investigated the dispersal of zygotes of A. nodosum at three sites on Swans Island, ME, USA, to determine its variability under natural conditions and to test whether limited dispersal explains recruitment patterns. 3  At each site we released artificially fertilized, marked zygotes from a single point during the rising tide, and sampled their dispersal using two methods: sampling the water column to track the dispersing cloud of zygotes; and assaying caged ceramic tiles affixed to the shore for the presence of marked zygotes. 4  At all sites, zygotes were diluted to ≤1·3% of the initial … 
Janet Kubler|High-temperature tolerance of photosynthesis in the red alga Chondrus crispus|Janet E Kübler, Ian R Davison|1993/10/1|Marine Biology|117|2|327-335|Springer-Verlag|Chondrus crispus (Stackhouse) is a perennial red seaweed, common in intertidal and shallow sublittoral communities throughout the North Atlantic Ocean. In the intertidal zone, C. crispus may experience rapid temperature changes of 10 to 20C° during a single immerison-emerision cycle, and may be exposed to temperatures that exceed the thermal limits for long-term survival. C. crispus collected year-round at Long Cove Point, Chamberlain, Maine, USA, during 1989 and 1990, underwent phenotypic acclimation to growth temperature in the laboratory. This phenotypic acclimation enhanced its ability to withstand brief exposure to extreme temperature. Plants grown at summer seawater temperature (20°C) were able to maintain constant rates of lightsaturated photosynthesis at 30°C for 9 h. In contrast, light-saturated photosynthetic rates of plants grown at winter seawater temperature (5°C) declined rapidly … 
Janet Kubler|Physiological responses to environmental variation in intertidal red algae: does thallus morphology matter?|Steven R Dudgeon, Janet E Kübler, Robert L Vadas, Ian R Davison|1995/2/9|Marine Ecology Progress Series|||193-206|Inter-Research|Morphological variation within and among many species of algae show correlated life history traits. The trade-offs of life history traits among different morphs are presumed to be determined by morphology. Form-function hypotheses also predict that algae of different morphological groups exhibit different tolerances to physiological stress, whereas algae within a morphological group respond similarly to stress. We tested this hypothesis by comparing photosynthetic and respiratory responses to variation in season, light, temperature, desiccation and freezing among the morphologically similar fronds of Chondrus crispus and Mastocarpus stellatus and the alternate stage crust of M. stellatus. Physiological differences between fronds of the 2 species and crusts and fronds were consistent with their patterns of distribution and abundance in the intertidal zone. However, there was no clear relationship between algal …

These species have different temperature ranges for growth that reflect seasonal temperature extremes in their natural distributions. L. baileyana is a temperate-subtropical species which grows between 15 and 33°C, whereas L. orcadensis is a boreal-temperate species which grows between 10 and 20°C. Interspecific differences in the photosynthetic responses to temperature were similar to those for growth, suggesting that photosynthesis may determine the temperature range over which Lomentaria tetrasporophytes can grow. Light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were higher in L. orcadensis below 15°C, whereas L. baileyana could photosynthesize at temperatures above 30°C, which inhibited photosynthesis in L. orcadensis. These differences were attributable to …

A diverse combination of approaches is essential to decipher the consequences of OA to marine organisms, communities, and ecosystems. Consequently, the benefits and limitations of each approach must be considered carefully. Major research challenges involve experimentally addressing the effects of OA in the context of large natural variability in seawater carbonate system parameters and other interactive variables, integrating the results from different research approaches, and scaling results across different temporal and spatial … 
Janet Kubler|FERTILIZATION SUCCESS CAN DRIVE PATTERNS OF PHASE DOMINANCE IN COMPLEX LIFE HISTORIES1|Janna Fierst, Casey TerHorst, Janet E Kübler, Steve Dudgeon|2005/4|Journal of phycology|41|2|238-249|Blackwell Science Inc|Many algal life cycles alternate between two free‐living generations. Life histories in which the two generations look identical (isomorphic) are common, particularly in the Rhodophyta. Reports of natural populations dominated by one generation of the life history have sought explanation in terms of phase‐specific differences in mortality and reproductive output, yet in many cases identification of these adaptations has been elusive or inconsistent with predictions. We hypothesized that the gametophyte‐to‐sporophyte ratio of ecologically equivalent isomorphs could result from variation in fertilization rate. We developed two models to test this hypothesis: one representing a generalized isomorphic life history and the other specific to red algae with a Polysiphonia‐type life history. Fertilization rate affected the gametophyte‐to‐sporophyte ratio, especially at low fertilization rates. In the general model, gametophytes … 
Janet Kubler|Temperature dependent change in the complexity of form of Chondrus crispus fronds|Janet E Kübler, Steve R Dudgeon|1996/12/15|Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|207|1-2|15-24|Elsevier|Chondrus crispus, a perennial red seaweed, experiences extreme temperature variation living in the intertidal zone of the western North Atlantic. We examined morphological plasticity of this species in response to temperature by growing fronds at 5 and 20 °C, temperatures representative of winter and summer surface seawater in the Gulf of Maine. As expected, C. crispus had higher growth rates at the higher temperature when growth rate was measured in terms of length, biomass, surface area, dichotomy and branch production. The higher growth rate of fronds at 20 °C was associated with a distribution of accumulated biomass into more surface area/unit biomass and more branches/unit length or biomass. These differences resulted in the growth of morphologically more complex thalli at the higher temperature, as measured by significantly higher fractal dimension and ratio of perimeter to square root of the …

We were specifically interested in the responses of light-limited photosynthesis to temperature and the effects of short-term thermal changes (of the order of minutes). Thermal acclimation to constant temperatures over 3–4 weeks had significant effects on the light-use characteristics of this species such that in comparison with those grown at 5°C, 20°C-grown plants had higher concentrations of chlorophyll a and total phycobilins, which were associated with larger photosynthetic unit sizes. Plants grown at the higher temperature had greater photosynthetic efficiencies (α) and higher rates of light-limited photosynthesis at a given photon flux density than did plants acclimated to 5°C. Plants acclimated to 20°C were less sensitive to short-term temperature changes than were 5°C-acclimated plants. These results are … 
Janet Kubler|Inorganic carbon acquisition by red seaweeds grown under dynamic light regimes|Janet E Kübler, John A Raven|1996/7/1|Hydrobiologia|326|1|401-406|Kluwer Academic Publishers|Palmaria palmata, which is able to use HCO inf3 sup− as a carbon source for photosynthesis, and Lomentaria articulata, which is dependent on diffusive uptake of dissolved CO2, were grown under constant light and light with sunflecks designed to model wave-induced fluctuations of near-shore underwater light. Both species exhibited significantly increased stable carbon isotope discrimination (more negative values of δ13C relative to PDB) when grown with sunflecks. More negative δ13C values were associated with decreased growth rate of P. palmata but not of L. articulata. The contrasting effects of sunflecks on the carbon-use characteristics of the two species are discussed in terms of the energetic cost of HCO inf3 sup− use and the susceptibility of CO2 diffusion-dependent species to photoinhibition.

Using the rhodophyte species Palmaria palmata (Huds.) Lamour and Lomentaria articulata (Huds.) Lyngb., we compared the effects of growth‐saturating constant photon flux density (PFD) (95 μmol photons · m−2· s−1) to those of a dynamic light supply modeled on canopy movements in the intertidal zone (25 μmol photons · m−2· s−1 background PFD plus light flecks of 350 μmol photons · m−2· s−1, 0.1 Hz). The time required for P. palmata and L. articulata to be fully photoinduced was not affected by the dynamics of light supply. L. articulata required only 6 min of illumination with either fluctuating or constant light …

Janet Kubler|Predicting effects of ocean acidification and warming on algae lacking carbon concentrating mechanisms|Janet E Kübler, Steven R Dudgeon|2015/7/14|PloS one|10|7|e0132806|Public Library of Science|Seaweeds that lack carbon-concentrating mechanisms are potentially inorganic carbon-limited under current air equilibrium conditions. To estimate effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and ocean acidification on photosynthetic rates, we modeled rates of photosynthesis in response to pCO2, temperature, and their interaction under limiting and saturating photon flux densities. We synthesized the available data for photosynthetic responses of red seaweeds lacking carbon-concentrating mechanisms to light and temperature. The model was parameterized with published data and known carbonate system dynamics. The model predicts that direction and magnitude of response to pCO2 and temperature, depend on photon flux density. At sub-saturating light intensities, photosynthetic rates are predicted to be low and respond positively to increasing pCO2, and negatively to increasing temperature. Consequently, pCO2 and temperature are predicted to interact antagonistically to influence photosynthetic rates at low PFD. The model predicts that pCO2 will have a much larger effect than temperature at sub-saturating light intensities. However, photosynthetic rates under low light will not increase proportionately as pCO2 in seawater continues to rise. In the range of light saturation (Ik), both CO2 and temperature have positive effects on photosynthetic rate and correspondingly strong predicted synergistic effects. At saturating light intensities, the response of photosynthetic rates to increasing pCO2 approaches linearity, but the model also predicts increased importance of thermal over pCO2 effects, with effects acting additively … 
Janet Kubler|Reproductive effort of Mastocarpus papillatus (Rhodophyta) along the California coast1|Stacy A Krueger‐Hadfield, Janet E Kübler, Steven R Dudgeon|2013/4|Journal of phycology|49|2|271-281||Species with sexual and asexual life cycles may exhibit intraspecific differences in reproductive effort. The spatial separation of sexual and asexual lineages, called geographic parthenogenesis, is common in plants, animals, and algae. Mastocarpus papillatus is a well‐documented case of geographic parthenogenesis in which sexuals dominate southern populations, asexuals dominate northern popula‐tions, whereas mixed populations occur throughout central California. We quantified abundances and reproductive effort of sexual and asexual fronds and tetrasporophytes at eight sites in California to test the hypotheses that (1) reduced sexual reproduction at higher latitudes and tidal heights explains the observed geographic parthenogenesis and (2) reproductive effort (spore production per blade area) declines with increasing latitude. Abundances of all phases varied site‐specifically. However, there was no …

Janet Kubler|Hydrozoans and the shape of things to come|Steven R Dudgeon, Janet E Kübler|2011/1/1||59||107-144|Academic Press|The physiological mechanisms that regulate adaptive plasticity of clonal organisms are key to their success in changing environments. Here, we review the mechanisms that regulate morphological plasticity of colonial hydrozoans. There is a heritable, genetic basis to colony form, but environmentally-induced plasticity and self-reinforcing developmental physiology explain much of total phenotypic variance. Morphological development of colonial hydrozoans emerges from interactions among (1) behaviors which drive gastrovascular transport, (2) architecture of the gastrovascular system that determines hydrodynamic characteristics of vascular flow, and, (3) gene products that vary in response to physiological signals provided by gastrovascular transport. Several morphogenetic signaling mechanisms have been identified, including, reactive oxygen species and nutrient concentrations in the hydroplasm, and … 
Janet Kubler|The occurrence, and influence on photolithotrophs, of high oxygen concentrations|John A Raven, Andrew M Johnston, Richard Parsons, Janet Kübler|1994|Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Section B: Biological Sciences|102||193-201|Royal Society of Edinburgh Scotland Foundation|Hyperoxia (O2 in solution in excess of air-equilibrium values) occurs in certain photosynthesising cells which use inorganic C concentrating mechanisms, and as a result of abiological mechanisms. Geochemical evidence suggests that the atmosphere may have had significantly higher O2 partial pressures in the past (e.g. the Upper Carboniferous) than occurs today. Biochemical effects of high O2 concentrations in solution include inhibition of RUBISCO (competitive with CO2) and nitrogenase, as well as damage caused by higher levels of toxic O species (H2O2, O2 and, especially, 1O2 and OH). The influence of high (twice the extant level) atmospheric O2 on growth of non-N2-fixers is as predicted from the properties of RUBISCO and the occurrence of inorganic C concentrating mechanisms. Acclimation of N2-fixers to twice the extant O2 level involves increased restriction on O2 diffusion to nitrogenase so that …

This study determined how the opportunistic macroalga, Ulva australis responded to simultaneous changes in decreasing pH and NH4+ enrichment. This was investigated in a week-long growth experiment across a range of predicted future pHs with ambient and enriched NH4+ treatments followed by measurements of relative growth rates (RGR), NH4+ uptake rates and pools, total chlorophyll, and tissue carbon and nitrogen content. Rapid light curves (RLCs) were used to measure the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm). Photosynthetic capacity was derived from the RLCs and included the efficiency of light harvesting (α), slope of photoinhibition (β), and the light saturation point (Ek). The results showed that NH4+ enrichment did not modify the effects of pH on RGRs, NH4+ uptake rates and pools, total chlorophyll, rETRmax, α, β, Fv/Fm, tissue C and N, and the C:N ratio. However, Ek was differentially affected by pH under different NH4+ treatments. Ek increased with decreasing pH in the ambient NH4+ treatment, but not in the enriched NH4+ treatment. NH4+ enrichment increased RGRs, NH4+ pools, total chlorophyll, rETRmax, α, β, Fv/Fm, and tissue N, and decreased NH4+ uptake rates and the C:N ratio. Decreased pH increased total chlorophyll content, rETRmax, Fv/Fm, and tissue N content, and decreased the C:N ratio. Therefore, the results indicate that U. australis growth is increased with NH4+ enrichment and not … 
Janet Kubler|Asexuality and the cryptic species problem|Steve Dudgeon, Janet E Kübler, John A West, Mitsunobu Kamiya, Stacy A Krueger-Hadfield|2017/5/1|Perspective in Phycology|4||47-59||Genetic sequence data allows for the identification of previously imperceptible cryptic species. Cryptic species are common in algae that have few morphologically distinguishable features. Identifying cryptic species with asexual life cycles requires consideration of whether the biology of the algae meets the assumptions of the analysis used to delimit species and recognition that the mating system governs the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations. We provide examples of species complexes in Caloglossa and Mastocarpus, where delimitations of cryptic species are confounded by the occurrence of asexual strains. Obligate asexuality causes linkage of nuclear, plastidal and mitochondrial genes, shorter generation times, mutation accumulation and drift relative to the sexually reproducing metapopulations, for which most analytical tools were designed. 
Janet Kubler|Oxygen-Insensitive Growth of Algae with and Without CO2-Concentrating Mechanisms|JA Raven, JE Kübler, AM Johnston, LJ Poole, R Taylor, SG McInroy|1998||||3331-3337|Springer, Dordrecht|The present atmosphere contains some 0.208 moles of O2 per mole of total gas. This normoxic situation corresponds to some 21 kPa O2 with the standard sea-level atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa, which is equivalent to an equilibrium concentration in solution of between 0.1 mol O2 m−3 for very saline water at close to the upper temperature limit for eukaryotic O2-evolvers (e.g. the Dead Sea) and 0.4 mol O2 m−3 for freshwater close to the freezing point (1,2). Physical phenomena such as decreasing atmospheric pressure with altitude and pressure from breaking waves and from formation of ice from snow followed by melting can respectively produce dissolved O2 which are respectively higher and lower than the equilibrium value. However, it is biological activity which produces the most extreme O2 concentration in the biosphere. Hypoxia and thence anoxia develop when the rate of organic O2 supply …

In that context, the objective of this study was to develop a system to experimentally control diets of hydrozoans in culture that could be used to test effects of specific compounds. This diet delivery system consisted of a known concentration of homogenate of brine shrimp nauplii that was solidified in a 1% agar block cut to the size of, and containing the equivalent of, a single, 2-day old brine shrimp nauplius larva. We tested the utility of this system by comparing the frequencies of ingestion, and rates of gastrovascular transport and growth following feeding, between polyps of Podocoryna carnea fed either a single brine shrimp nauplius (controls) or an agar cube including brine shrimp homogenate. Polyps fed experimental diets …

Janet Kubler|The interacting effects of nutrient enrichment and ocean acidification on the growth and physiology of the macroalgae Ulva sp.|LB Reidenbach, CL Hurd, J Kubler, PA Fernandez, PP Leal, F Noisette, AT Revill, CM McGraw|2016/2||||||Ocean acidification, caused by the increased absorption of carbon dioxide in the ocean, changes the carbon chemistry in the seawater, decreases pH, and alters the chemical speciation of some nitrogenous compounds, such as ammonium. The green macroalgae Ulva spp. are intertidal species that occur worldwide. Ocean acidification may alter the growth response of Ulva sp. to increased nutrients by altering the photosynthetic and nutrient physiology of the algae as well as the bioavailability of nutrients. To determine if there is an interactive effect between ocean acidification and nutrient enrichment Ulva sp. were grown in the lab in a cross of three pCO2 levels under ambient and enriched ammonium concentrations. We predicted that the growth rates of Ulva sp. in ammonium enriched treatments would be enhanced by increased pCO2 relative to those in ambient ammonium concentrations. While growth rate … 
Janet Kubler|The Role of Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms in the Varied Response of the Green Macroalga, Ulva Lactuca, To Ocean Acidification|SR Scoma, J Kubler, AM Nisumaa|2016/2||||||The majority of fleshy macroalgae, across all groups, contain carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that facilitate use of dissolved inorganic carbon. Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the resulting shift in seawater carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification, OA) may have varying effects on algae depending on their mode of inorganic carbon concentration, if any, and its regulation. Energetic costs of carbon uptake mechanisms may change with rising pCO2 and that may explain the variability in effects of OA on growth and photosynthesis. We investigated the relative activity of CCMs in the green alga Ulva lactuca across a range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (385-1200 muatm) spanning recent concentrations to the high end predictions for 2100 (IPCC). U. lactuca is a fast growing species with a well characterized, multistep CCM that uses HCO3-to saturate photosynthesis with inorganic carbon. To … 
Janet Kubler|Limits to the Positive Effect of Ocean Acidification on Macroalgal Primary Production, Interactions with Light and Temperature|J Kubler, SR Dudgeon, AM Nisumaa|2016/2||||||About one third of macroalgal species lack any carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM), which prevents carbon limitation under air equilibrium in other seaweed species. It is predicted that those species lacking CCM's will benefit from ongoing ocean acidification in terms of primary productivity and growth. The absolute sizes and pattern of those benefits are not known. Here, we compare the results of a model based on composite data from the literature, with a growth experiment using Plocamium cartilagineum, a broadly distributed rhodophyte species lacking a carbon concentrating mechanism and hypothesized to be carbon limited under current conditions. We grew P. cartilagineum, at 15 and 20 C in seawater aerated with a total of 53 different pCO2s (from 344 to 1053µatm), in 8 multiweek trials over 12 months. We measured growth and photosynthetic rates. A linear mixed model analysis was used to partition …

Here, we discuss the effectiveness and limitations of current research approaches used to address this goal. A diverse combination of approaches is essential to decipher the consequences of OA to marine organisms, communities, and ecosystems. Consequently, the benefits and limitations of each approach must be considered carefully. Major research challenges involve experimentally addressing the effects of OA in the context of large natural variability in seawater carbonate system parameters and other interactive variables, integrating the results from different research approaches, and scaling results across different temporal and spatial scales.

Spatial structure and habitat partitioning can facilitate the coexistence of ecologically similar organisms, and in M. papillatus a large scale geographic spatial division is well documented. Variants of M. papillatus display geographic parthenogenesis where sexual fronds are common south of San Francisco Bay and apomicts dominate north of San Francisco Bay. Although geographic parthenogenesis in M. papillatus is well‐documented small‐scale spatial structure was not previously known due to the similar appearance of sexual and apomictic upright fronds. We investigated whether sexual and apomictic fronds differed in their spatial distribution by sampling for vertical differences in intertidal height and horizontal patchiness. Fronds were sampled when reproductive and cultured … 
Janet Kubler|Ian R. Davison, Janet E. Kuebler, Robert S. Steneck|Robert L Vadas|1988|Benthic Productivity and Marine Resources of the Gulf of Maine||88|27|US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Office of Undersea Research|Previous research indicated the occurrence of a deep water population of Laminaria at Ammen rock and Ammen rock pinnacle in the central Gulf of Maine (Vadas and Steneck, 1988). The Ammen Laminaria closely resembles Laminaria digitata, which occurs through the North Atlantic including the coast of Maine. Ammen plants differ from coastal L. digitata by having narrower and less digitate blades, by possessing muscilage ducts in the stipe and holdfast and by the frequent occurrence of whorls of haptera in the holdfast. Furthermore, the Ammen Laminaria population occurs at considerable depth (25-35 m), whereas L. digitata typically has maximum abundance in shallow water. By themselves these differences are not sufficient to justify placing the Ammen Laminaria in a separate taxon from L. digitata. L. digitata is known to exhibit considerable phenotypic plasticity (Sundene, 1964) and the taxonomic significance of mucilage ducts is open to question (Chapman, 1973). However, recent preliminary studies indicate that large differences occur between chloroplast DNA sequences in Ammen Laminaria and coastal L. digitata (Fain, Vadas and Steneck, unpublished), suggesting that Ammen Laminaria may be a distinct species. Thus, it is currently an open question as to whether or not the Ammen Laminaria is a new species, or if it is a deep water ecotype of L. digitata. Irrespective of the taxon to which the Ammen Laminaria population is eventually assigned, a key question is what, if any, adaptations have evolved for life in a deep water environment characterized by low light levels. A priori one would expect this population to have evolved …

Their skeletons have been used as amulets or jewellery since antiquity and are one of the most valuable living marine resources. Precious coral fisheries are generally characterized by the ‘boomand-bust’principle, quickly depleting a discovered stock and then moving on to the next one. Most known stocks are overexploited today, and populations are in decline. The unsustainable nature of most fisheries is clearly revealed by analyzing all available data. Precious corals belong to the functional group of deep corals and are important structure-forming organisms, so called ecosystem engineers, that provide shelter for other organisms, increasing biodiversity. Yet, their management is usually focused on single species rather than a holistic habitat management approach. This review compares the biology of precious corals as …

Its long history of intensive commercial harvesting has resulted in a well-documented decline of its stocks throughout the Mediterranean, becoming especially apparent during the last two decades. Based on the extensive ecological data from the Costa Brava (NE Spain) stocks, this study reviews, for the first time, socioeconomic aspects and the impact of current fishing practices on the red coral population structure and reproductive biology. A comparison of the intensively harvested populations in shallow water with that of the infrequently harvested ones in deep water, along with a population in a marine reserve as well, reveals that 98% of all shallow water colonies show a juvenile size and branching pattern as …

The Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum, L. 1758) is a longevous octocoral that is harvested commercially, yet natural and anthropogenic influences on its population size structure are little understood. This study found that some harvested red coral populations had a significantly different size structure when compared to populations at the nearby Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Medas Islands at the Spanish Costa Brava (NW Mediterranean). Eighty-nine percent of the red corals in the harvested Costa Brava area are less than 10 years old and 96% of all colonies have not yet grown more than second-order branches. The size/age distribution of the harvested population is notably skewed towards younger and smaller colonies. Thus, although red coral is …

Additionally, linear growth rates were measured in M. oculata and L. pertusa for 2 and 1 yr, respectively. The weight measurements revealed growth rates, expressed as percent growth per day (mean±SD), of 0.11±0.04 for M. oculata, 0.02±0.01 for L. pertusa, 0.06±0.03 for D. dianthus and 0.04±0.02% d–1 for D. cornigera. Growth in M. oculata was significantly higher (p< 0.0001) than in the other 3 CWC species. For M. oculata and L. pertusa, also linear growth was recorded. These values (mean±SD) were 0.014±0.007 and 0.024±0.018 mm d–1 for M. oculata and L. pertusa, respectively. This is the first study that compares the growth rates of 4 different CWC species under the same experimental conditions of water flow, temperature, salinity and food supply. These corals have different growth rates, both in terms of total weight increase and linear increase, and these growth rates can be related to interspecific physiological differences. Data on growth rates are essential to understand the population dynamics of CWC as well as the recovery capacity of these communities after disturbance. 
Georgios Tsounis|Prey-capture rates in four Mediterranean cold water corals|Georgios Tsounis, Covadonga Orejas, Stéphanie Reynaud, Josep Maria Gili, Denis Allemand, Christine Ferrier-Pagès|2009|Marine Ecology Progress Series||||Inter Research|Little is known about the basic biology of deep-water coral species. In this study, we experimentally assessed the rates of ingestion of Artemia salina adults and nauplii by the 4 Mediterranean cold water coral species Dendrophyllia cornigera, Desmophyllum cristagalli, Madrepora oculata, and Lophelia pertusa. All species ingested A. salina in adult and nauplii forms. L. pertusa showed the highest grazing rate for both prey types, whereas M. oculata showed the lowest capture rates among the 4 species, and was practically unable to ingest adult prey. Capture rates of the 4 coral species ranged between 5 and 8 adult A. salina, and 50 and 280 nauplii polyp–1 h–1. Surprisingly, both capture rates and carbon uptake (adult Artemia ingestion: 994 to 3542 µg C polyp–1 h–1; nauplii ingestion: 78.1 to 462 µg C polyp–1 h–1) were within the range of values found in some tropical corals (which often ingest 0.004 to 3600 prey items polyp–1 h–1). The results show that the capture rates and energy input of the studied cold water coral species appear to be on a level that is comparable to that of other corals, even tropical zooxanthellate species.

More than in active suspension feeders (such as bivalves, ascidians and sponges) their prey capture is affected by spatial and temporal prey distribution and water movement. Corallium rubrum is a characteristic gorgonian of Mediterranean sublittoral hard bottom communities. This study found a high variability in the annual cycle of prey capture rate, prey size and ingested biomass, compared to other Mediterranean gorgonians. Detrital particulate organic matter (POM) was found throughout the year in the polyp guts and constituted the main proportion of the diet (25–44%). Crustacean fragments and copepods (14–46%) accounted for the second major proportion, while invertebrate eggs (9–15%) and phytoplankton (8–11%) constituted the smallest part of the diet. To verify the importance of …

Overall, 517 red coral recruits settled on the tiles during the experiment, 189 of which (126 at Calafuria and 63 at Elba) were still surviving, in 2007, when the tiles were removed. The recruitment density at Medes was only one tenth of that …

Grazing experiments were conducted at temperatures between 5° C and 40° C and at food concentrations, of the flagellate Isochrysis galbana, ranging between~ 0 and 10 6 ml–1. In total, 136 grazing rates were determined, using the prey depletion method, for rotifers acclimated to treatments for 0.5 or 4 h. The response of grazing rate to temperature and food concentration was described using a model that combined a rectangular hyperbolic function for food concentration and a sigmoidal function for temperature. Using non-linear curve-fitting methods an equation was obtained: G=(45× F)/(159000+ F)× 0.94/(1+ 219000× T-4.35), where G is the grazing rate (flagellates rotifer–1 min–1), F is the …

The present study analyzes the relationship between energy storage molecule concentration (i.e. tissue balance of protein–carbohydrate–lipid levels) and the gonadal output in two populations located at different depths (16–18 m and 40–45 m depth) through a seasonal cycle (2002–2003). In June 2003, another six populations have been sampled to compare medium-scale geographical variation. The colonies sampled were less than 6 cm high, thus representing the majority of the population in the studied area. There was no clear relationship between energy storage (i.e. carbohydrate and lipid levels) and gonadal output, nor in the seasonal cycle or the spatial variation. A clear-cut seasonal trend of energy storage was detected only in the shallower population. The water temperature was warmer at 20 m …

In the present study, 54 marble tiles were placed in June 2003 within red coral populations over 3 different geographic areas (Calafuria-Livorno and Elba MPA in Italy and Medes Islets MPA, in Spain), on vertical cliffs between 25 and 35 m. In each area 2 different sites were randomly selected. Tiles were subsequently sampled photographically. Between July and August 2003 red coral recruits settled on tiles in all the geographic areas and sites, exhibiting wide variability in their density. On the basis of a 2-factors nested ANOVA a significant variability between different sites at a few hundred metres distance occurred, indicating high variations in the recruitment process …

Between 10 and 33% of the colonies in unprotected populations were partially colonized by epibionts, most likely following tissue injury, whereas only 4 to 10% of the populations in a marine protected area were affected. Populations that were simultaneously exposed to fishing as well as intensive SCUBA diving showed the highest proportion of colonization. Colonies with approximately 30 to 35% of epibiont coverage showed significantly lower numbers of gonads per polyp. Similarly, concentrations of lipids were lower in females with epibionts, thus indicating allocation of resources into recovery of injured tissue instead of reproduction. Furthermore, whereas unaffected colonies showed a uniform distribution of carbohydrates and proteins through apical branches to more central ones, colonies with epibionts had significantly lower protein concentrations in branches that are positioned 3 branching order levels closer to the stem. The results thus indicate a preference of apical growth in recovering colonies, via a different distribution of food within the colony. Reproductive success in surface-brooding corals growing on walls and overhangs might also be reduced by SCUBA bubbles from divers passing below, as bubbles …

Georgios Tsounis|Management hurdles for sustainable harvesting of Corallium rubrum|Georgios Tsounis, Sergio Rossi, Lorenzo Bramanti, Giovanni Santangelo|2013/5/1|Marine Policy|39||361-364|Pergamon|Declining fishing yields of the highly valuable Mediterranean red coral indicated overexploitation by the 1980s. In response, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) established management guidelines in the late 1980s, such as daily quotas, minimum size, and most importantly, the ban of dredging for coral in 1994. However, recent data led to new concerns about the sustainability of coral harvest by highlighting previous and ongoing overexploitation. The US and EU reacted in 2007 and 2009 by proposing to include the family Corallidae in CITES Appendix II to regulate trade. However, the proposals were rejected based on the hope and promise that local management would provide a less obtrusive solution. This article argues that limited resources and insufficient interdisciplinarity limit the research needed to improve management guidelines, while a lack of human and financial resources hinder local … 
Georgios Tsounis|Records of black coral (Antipatharia) and red coral (Corallium rubrum) fishing activities in the Maltese Islands|Alan Deidun, G Tsounis, Francesca Balzan, Aaron Micallef|2010/9|Marine Biodiversity Records|3|||Cambridge University Press|This study presents a description of the little known coral fishery activities around the Maltese Islands. Apart from previously unpublished catch data on Corallium rubrum, this study also reveals, sporadic harvesting of black coral (Antipatharia) past and serves as a first record of Leiopathes glaberrima in Maltese waters. The data indicate that precious coral fishing was regulated on an arbitrary license system that was not based on scientific management. Both fisheries ceased in 1987, although personal communication with industry operators indicates that C. rubrum is still being unofficially fished on a reduced scale. As Mediterranean precious coral fisheries originated so long-age, and since so little is known about precious coral species' distribution, the presented historical data may help in evaluating baseline levels of population status and past anthropogenic impact. Finally, the study also highlights the importance …

Sexual products (number of oocytes and spermatic sacs) were quantified, and biochemical characteristics (lipid content and free fatty acid content and composition) were determined to investigate the parental energetic investment and demand in reproduction. Results suggested that the majority of the energetic cost was due to reproductive activity (i.e., gametogenesis and spawning). The two species exhibited different life history strategies, with P. clavata investing more energy in reproduction than C. rubrum. However, P. clavata is reproductively more sensitive to inter-annual changes in environmental conditions. 
Georgios Tsounis|Three decades of coral reef community dynamics in St. John, USVI: a contrast of scleractinians and octocorals|Georgios Tsounis, Peter J Edmunds|2017/1/1|Ecosphere|8|1|||To better understand phase shifts on Caribbean reefs, we quantified community structure on shallow reefs over 27 yr in St. John, US Virgin Islands, contrasted the community dynamics of scleractinians and octocorals, and evaluated the extent to which community structure was associated with rainfall, temperature, and hurricanes. To gain insight into the likely abundance of octocorals on future reefs with low scleractinian cover, we compared two sites dominated by the major Caribbean reef-building coral Orbicella annularis. Between 1987 and 2013, scleractinian cover declined from 45% to 6% at Yawzi Point, but remained at~ 30% at Tektite. We compared changes in community structure using four benthic assemblage constructs—“scleractinian-focused”(cover of scleractinians, macroalgae, and CTB ie crustose coralline algae, algal turf, and bare space),“octocoral-focused”(abundance of octocorals, cover of … 
Georgios Tsounis|Sexual reproductive cycle of the epibiotic soft coral Alcyonium coralloides (Octocorallia, Alcyonacea)|Elena Quintanilla, Josep-Maria Gili, Pablo López-González, Georgios Tsounis, Teresa Madurell, Ida Fiorillo, Sergio Rossi|2013/4|Aquatic Biology|18||113-124|Inter-Research|Alcyonium coralloides is an epibiotic soft coral overgrowing living colonies of Mediterranean gorgonians. The main features of the sexual reproductive cycle of this soft coral species are described and quantified for the first time, in a population found at 18 to 22 m depth off the Medes Islands (NW Mediterranean). A. coralloides is a gonochoric internal brooder. The sexual cycle showed a single reproductive event per year. Gametogenesis took 5 to 6 mo, which is the shortest known gametogenesis in littoral octocorals (especially for oogenesis). The maximum mean±SD diameter was 365±86 µm for spermatic cysts and 632±125 µm for mature oocytes. Sperm was released in spring (late May). Average male and female fecundity in this last phase of the cycle was 15±9 spermatic cysts and 7±4 oocytes per polyp, respectively. Larvae of about 1000 µm in length were observed in the gastrovascular cavities of female colonies in May, before they were released in June. We suggest that the remarkable short gametogenesis and timing shown by A. coralloides is an adaptation to optimize the colonization of its host (in this case the gorgonian octocoral Paramuricea clavata). We conclude that A. coralloides larvae could be ready to settle in early summer when the host P. clavata is probably more vulnerable as a result of its own reproductive cycle coming to an end. 
Georgios Tsounis|The potential for self-seeding by the coral Pocillopora spp. in Moorea, French Polynesia|Georgios Tsounis, Peter J Edmunds|2016/11/9|PeerJ|4||e2544|PeerJ Inc.|Coral reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia, suffered catastrophic coral mortality through predation by Acanthaster planci from 2006 to 2010, and Cyclone Oli in 2010, yet by 2015 some coral populations were approaching pre-disturbance sizes. Using long-term study plots, we quantified population dynamics of spawning Pocillopora spp. along the north shore of Moorea between 2010 and 2014, and considered evidence that population recovery could be supported by self-seeding. Results scaled up from study plots and settlement tiles suggest that the number of Pocillopora spp. colonies on the outer reef increased 1,890-fold between 2010 and 2014/2015, and in the back reef, 8-fold between 2010 and 2014/2015. Assuming that spawning Pocillopora spp. in Moorea release similar numbers of eggs as con-generics in Hawaii, and fertilization success is similar to other spawning corals, the capacity of Pocillopora spp. to produce larvae was estimated. These estimates suggest that Pocillopora spp. in Moorea produced a large excess of larvae in 2010 and 2014 relative to the number required to produce the recruits found in the back reef and outer reef in 2010 and 2014, even assuming that ∼99.9% of the larvae do not recruit in Moorea. Less than a third of the recruits in one year would have to survive to produce the juvenile Pocillopora spp. found in the back and outer reefs in 2010 and 2014/2015. Our first order approximations reveal the potential for Pocillopora spp. on the north shore of Moorea to produce enough larvae to support local recruitment and population recovery following a catastrophic disturbance.

Mediterranean Red Coral (Corallium rubrum), is endemic to the Mediterranean sea and neighboring Atlantic rocky shores and has been exploited for jewelry since ancient times. Despite the lack of photosynthetic symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.), red coral growth and survival do depend on sea water temperature, as well as on trophic conditions and other physico-chemical parameters. We developed and applied a mechanistic numerical model to describe the growth of a C. rubrum colony (polyps number, polyp and gametes biomass, skeletal inorganic and organic matter) as a function of food availability and seawater temperature. The model follows a bioenergetic approach and is calibrated vs available experimental observations. Model results highlight that larger colonies are more sensitive to high temperature and actual … 
Georgios Tsounis|Demography of long-lived octocorals: survival and local extinction|Giovanni Santangelo, R Cupido, S Cocito, L Bramanti, G Tsounis, M Iannelli|2012/7|Proceedings of the 12th Coral Reef Symposium Cairns|||8-12||Gorgonian corals are slow growing, long lived species whose three dimensional colonies form dense canopies on Mediterranean reefs. As they are habitat forming, the ecology of the reef community depends in a large part on their survival. The red coral Corallium rubrum is a precious gorgonian whose heavily harvested populations have changed their size and age structure in shallow waters. In general gorgonians show low recruitment and low population growth rates. In 1999 and 2003 two mortality events, putatively linked to Global Climate Change,(GCC) affected a population of the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata at the Western edge of the Gulf of La Spezia (NE Ligurian Sea Italy). The availability of pre and post mortality demographic data allowed us to follow the trajectory of this population over 12 years. In the first years population density decreased drastically and 90%, of the colonies died or suffered partial mortality; moreover recruitment decreased to 40% and the dominant size classes shifted towards a smaller size. In the subsequent years population density increased, damaged colonies recovered and recruitment reached six times that of 1998. While the populations of both species recovered, an increased frequency of mortality events with GCC could lead to local extinction (C. rubrum) or to a new stable structure reached at a lower density (P. clavata). 
Georgios Tsounis|Variation of lipid and free fatty acid contents during larval release in two temperate octocorals according to their trophic strategy|N Viladrich, L Bramanti, G Tsounis, A Martínez-Quintana, C Ferrier-Pagès, S Rossi|2017/6/21|Marine Ecology Progress Series|573||117-128||This study investigated the energetic investment in larval release of 2 Mediterranean gorgonians with different trophic strategies: Eunicella singularis (mixotroph) and Corallium rubrum (heterotroph). Both are internal brooders, releasing larvae within a few weeks in summer. A biochemical approach, based on the analysis of stable isotopes, total lipid and free fatty acid (FFA) content, was applied in combination with the quantification of sexual products. Stable isotopes showed that food source varied seasonally for E. singularis, while it remained constant throughout the year for C. rubrum, suggesting a higher trophic plasticity of E. singularis, likely due to its mixotrophic feeding strategy. Although total lipid and FFA content were higher in E. singularis than in C. rubrum, both species showed low energetic investment in reproduction, probably linked to their low fecundity and reproductive output, compared to other gorgonians (eg Paramuricea clavata). The higher FFA content in E. singularis compared to C. rubrum can be explained by a higher metabolic demand and metabolite exchange between the host and its symbiotic algae. The higher inter-annual variability in total lipid and FFA content in C. rubrum suggests that this species is more sensitive to food constraints than E. singularis. Indeed, the inter-annual consistency in the trophic ecology (showed by the stable isotopes) means that C. rubrum is more affected by changes in food availability. Conversely, the mixotrophy makes E. singularis less sensitive to stress conditions caused by starvation or thermal stress. These physiological differences could partly explain the wider distribution of E. singularis …

This study focused on octocorals around St. John and St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, in order to: (1) describe variation in octocoral communities, (2) test for similarity in distribution of octocorals and scleractinians, and (3) identify factors associated with the distribution of octocorals that have value in understanding how reefs will change in the future. Photoquadrats recorded in 2011 on north and south shores were used to quantify octocoral and scleractinian abundance with generic resolution. MDS and PERMANOVA revealed clearer community variation relative to the spatial scales of investigation for octocorals compared to scleractinians. Multivariate spatial structuring for octocorals differed from that of scleractinians, suggesting the taxa responded in …

The electrochemical characterization of the settlement device was studied in order to investigate correlations between cathodic parameters (polarisation potential, current density, calcareous deposit composition) and larval settlement. The results obtained in the natural habitat (at 35 m depth) showed that settlement was five times lower on the electro-accreted aragonite in the presence of low cathodic current densities (i ≤ 1 μA cm−2) compared to both marble tiles and electro-accreted aragonite in the absence of polarisation. These last two substrata showed similar settlement values. The … 
Georgios Tsounis|Fishery management of the Mediterranean Red Coral: a call for a paradigm shift|Georgios Tsounis, Sergio Rossi, Josep-Maria Gili|2009/9/16||||123-143||The Mediterranean red coral (Corallium rubrum L. 1758, Gorgonacea, Octocorallia) has been used as jewelry since antiquity and is one the most valuable living marine resources (Tescione 1976). It has been harvested for millennia with ever evolving harvesting methods, that, as in most fisheries, have become over-efficient. Today there is overwhelming evidence that almost all known red coral stocks are overexploited (FAO 1983, FAO 1988, Santangelo et al. 1993b, Santangelo and Abbiati 2001, Tsounis et al. 2007). However, management and conservation options are still being debated between the industry, decision makers and even ecologists. Although harvesting pressure, slow growth and isolation of the populations create an unfavorable situation, the threat of species extinction is not clear. On the other hand, local extinction of shallow water populations due to overharvesting and mass mortality events is likely, and economic extinction is certain to occur if management measures are not revised. The significance of red coral and other cold water coral species is becoming clearer thanks to a growing amount of research showing that not only tropical coral reefs, but also deep corals and precious corals act as ecosystem engineers, providing three-dimensional habitat structure and increasing biodiversity. As a consequence, the interest of long term habitat management contradicts traditional fishery management that allows for a severe modification of the population structure of the target species. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed to ensure sustainable coral fisheries while maintaining diverse and productive marine habitats. Balanced …

Red coral has no predators, but it does have a parasite: a sponge that perforates colony bases. Yet if either elevated parasitism or a disease were responsible for the skewed populations, dead corals would remain as evidence, and we'd seen few. We knew that Mediterranean red coral is generally thought to be overharvested; in fact, Catalonia's fisheries department had commissioned our project to help guide an update of its coral-fishing regulations. But just nine legal coral divers work along the Costa Brava; it seemed unlikely that so few fishermen could distort the populations, though we had yet to learn the extent of poaching.

Pursuit of this goal typically involves testing for associations between community structure and environmental conditions, and in recent years, attention has focused on temperature and seawater pH. Such analyses are helpful in projecting coral reef community structure into the future, but their efficacy depends on the extent to which changes in community structure are correctly associated with causative processes, and whether future conditions are a subset of those experienced in the past. Here, we describe variation from 2014 to 2017 in one environmental factor, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), at 19-m depth on the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, and evaluate the extent to which this factor could cause changes in benthic community structure.

National Marine Fisheries Service|Corallium rubrum has been fished for 5000 years, and since the 1800s its fishery reached an industrial scale with several hundred boats dredging the Mediterranean for this valuable resource of the jewelry industry. Dramatic yield declines occurred in the 1980s, and the second FAO ad hoc Corallium rubrum consultation in 1988 concluded that the species was already overharvested (FAO 1988; Cognetti 1989). Subsequent research confirmed not only that the yields had dropped, but throughout the Mediterranean the known red coral populations in diving range consisted entirely of much smaller colonies (ca. 3 cm on average) than the maximum size of the species (more than 50 cm) (Garcia Rodriguez and Massó 1986; Santangelo et al. 1993; Santangelo and Abbiati 2001; Garrabou and Harmelin 2002; Santangelo et al. 2007; Tsounis et al. 2007).

United States. National Marine Fisheries Service|Management approaches based on a detailed knowledge of specific population demographic features are fundamental to ensure long-term exploitation sustainability (Knittweis et al. 2009). Demography focuses on the specific dynamics of each population, allowing to project population structure over time. This approach allows setting out local conservation strategies for wildlife and for exploited species structured into discrete local populations, such as the Mediterranean red coral (Abbiati et al. 1993). Regarding corals, long-term studies are scarce due to their slow growth and longevity (Connell 1997; Garrabou and Harmelin 2002). Because of its high economic value, the precious Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum (Cnidaria, Octocorallia, Gorgonacea) has been harvested for more than 2000 years and its shallow-water populations (living between 20 and 70 m depth), indicate a regression and even a partial economic extinction (Tsounis et al. 2007). Demographic studies based on sound age structure and growth rate assessment in different populations are nevertheless scarce (Santangelo et al. 2009). In this study we compared the age structure and the basal growth rate of two shallow Corallium rubrum populations dwelling in two marine protected areas

In order to sustainably manage coastal marine reserves, the entire continental shelf and upper slope should be protected. Recent findings in cold-water corals have influenced the Natura 2000 Network program, which is creating a European network of offshore marine protected areas for the first time. In this context, our discovery of wellpreserved and highly diverse communities in the Menorca-Mallorca channel is of special significance to marine conservation. This unexpected discovery can be attributed to the practices of a small artisanal fishing fleet, which self-regulates its own fishing activity, demonstrating that a more respectful exploitation approach to marine resources is feasible and economically profitable. This area has high ecological and evolutionary interests because it constitutes the only known example of pristine Mediterranean shelf communities. Moreover, we have found a possible Tethyan relict species, which supports the idea that the Mediterranean Sea played a dual role in the present biodiversity scenario, acting as a potential link between the ancient Indopacific Ocean and the incipient Atlantic Ocean, as well as a potential radiation centre towards the North Atlantic. Both hypotheses should be considered.

Quantification of sexual products and biochemical composition (lipid content and free fatty acid (FFA) content and composition) were used to examine the parental energetic investment and demand in reproduction. Results showed that the energetic cost is mainly due to the reproductive activity (i.e. gametogenesis and spawning). The two species displayed different life history strategies (with C. rubrum investing less energy in reproduction than P. clavata) and sensitivity to environmental conditions (being P. clavata more sensitive than C. rubrum). The quality of energetic reserves transferred from maternal colonies to larvae was analysed by comparing their FFA composition. C. rubrum showed a similar FFA composition in maternal colonies and larvae, whereas P. clavata transfers low amounts of energy to oocytes. FFA composition suggests that C. rubrum larvae have the highest dispersal and/or crawling behaviour capacity compared to P. clavata. This shows how FFA analyses can get insight into the activity rates, the dispersal and recruitment capability of different gorgonian species. Observed differences in energetic investments may affect the recovery dynamics of these species after major disturbances, with C. rubrum strategy mainly focused on resistance, while P. clavata on resilience

Chris Chabot|Global population structure of the tope (Galeorhinus galeus) inferred by mitochondrial control region sequence data|CL Chabot, LG Allen|2009/2|Molecular Ecology|18|3|545-552|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|In order to properly manage and conserve exploited shark species, detailed analyses of their population structure is needed. Global populations of Galeorhinus galeus are in decline due to the exploitation of the fishery over the past 80 years. Currently, the genetic structure of eastern Pacific populations of G. galeus is not known and recent observations in the northeastern Pacific suggest an increase in numbers. To evaluate gene flow among populations of G. galeus, 116 samples were collected and analysed from six geographically dispersed locations: Australia, North America, South Africa, South America (Argentina and Peru), and the UK. Analysis of 968 to 1006 bp of the 1068‐bp mitochondrial control region revealed 38 unique haplotypes that were largely restricted to their collecting locality. Significant genetic structure was detected among populations (ΦST = 0.84; P < 0.000001) and migration estimates were …

This is of particular importance for heavily exploited, commercially important species. The phylogenetic structure of the Yellowtail Jack, Seriola lalandi , was investigated using genetic data from 42 individuals collected from California, the Pacific coast of Baja California (Mexico), the Gulf of California (Mexico), New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, and Chile. An analysis using S. dumerili as an outgroup and combining the sequences of two mitochondrial genes (CR and COI) and four nuclear genes (RAG2, EHHADH, UBE3A, MLL) was used to determine the level of genetic divergence among samples from different geographic regions.

Chris Chabot|Characterization of 13 microsatellite loci for the tope shark, Galeorhinus galeus, discovered with next-generation sequencing and their utility for eastern Pacific smooth-hound …|Chris L Chabot, Sergio Nigenda|2011/7/1|Conservation Genetics Resources|3|3|553-555|Springer Netherlands|The tope shark, Galeorhinus galeus, is a commercially important member of the Triakidae that has been exploited globally for the past 80 years. Here we describe 13 microsatellite loci for G. galeus discovered by next-generation sequencing (Roche 454 pyrosequencing) and their utility for eastern Pacific smooth-hound sharks (Mustelus). These loci were polymorphic (3–12 alleles) with observed heterozygosity between 0.11 and 0.86 and expected heterozygosity between 0.24 and 0.87. Several loci (7 of 13) amplified consistently for Mustelus californicus and M. henlei. These loci are the first to be characterized explicitly for G. galeus and should be useful in the investigation of population structure of this vulnerable elasmobranch.

Here, microsatellite loci for M. henlei discovered by next-generation sequencing (Roche 454 pyrosequencing) are described. All loci were polymorphic (3–10 alleles) with observed heterozygosities between 0.24 and 0.89 and expected heterozygosities between 0.23 and 0.86. These loci are the first to be characterized explicitly for M. henlei and should be useful for the investigation of population structure and gene flow in this species and for other members of the Triakidae.

Data from the mitochondrial control region and six nuclear microsatellite loci revealed significant population structure among three populations: northern (San Francisco), central (Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, Punta Lobos, and San Felipe), and southern (Costa Rica). Patterns of long‐term and contemporary migration were incongruent, with long‐term migration being asymmetric and occurring in a north to south direction and a lack of significant contemporary migration observed between localities with the exception of Punta Lobos that contributed migrants to all localities within the central population. Our findings indicate that Point … 
Chris Chabot|Microsatellite loci confirm a lack of population connectivity among globally distributed populations of the tope shark Galeorhinus galeus (Triakidae)|CL Chabot|2015/8|Journal of fish biology|87|2|371-385|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|This study used 11 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci to determine the population connectivity of five geographically isolated populations of tope shark Galeorhinus galeus (Africa, Australia, North America, South America and western Europe). Genetic analyses revealed significant structure among all populations indicating a lack of population connectivity. These findings indicate that globally distributed populations of G. galeus are isolated and should be managed as distinct, independent stocks. 
Chris Chabot|Frequency of multiple paternity varies between two populations of brown smoothhound shark, Mustelus henlei|Chris L Chabot, Brent M Haggin|2014/4/1|Marine biology|161|4|797-804|Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Multiple paternity was recently observed in a population of the brown smoothhound shark, Mustelus henlei, from Las Barrancas, Baja California Sur, Mexico, with litters demonstrating the greatest percentage of multiple paternity for any shark species (93 % of litters and an average number of sires = 2.3). To determine whether this frequency is consistent elsewhere in the species’ range, 4 polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to determine the frequency of multiple paternity in 18 litters of M. henlei from Santa Catalina Island, CA, sampled in 2004, 2008, and 2012. Multiple paternity varied among sampling years with 2004 demonstrating multiple sires for 40 % of sampled litters (n = 10) with an average of 1.4 sires per litter and 2008/2012 demonstrating a total lack of multiply sired litters (n = 8). Although multiple paternity was detected in this study, the range of frequencies observed is lower than that … 
Chris Chabot|Developing a genetic baseline for the yellowtail amberjack species complex, Seriola lalandi sensu lato, to assess and preserve variation in wild populations of these globally …|Catherine M Purcell, Chris L Chabot, Matthew T Craig, Natalie Martinez-Takeshita, Larry G Allen, John R Hyde|2015/12/1|Conservation genetics|16|6|1475-1488|Springer Netherlands|Recent study suggest the globally distributed yellowtail amberjack, Seriola lalandi sensu lato, is a complex of three closely related species. Together, these and three other species of Seriola comprise an important component of global aquaculture production with an estimated annual value of $1.3 billion. As yellowtail aquaculture grows, the impact of unintentional releases on wild populations has become an increasingly important issue, particularly in light of international trade of hatchery seed. To create a genetic baseline, we examined spatial genetic structure in 260 specimens collected from seven locations over a wide geographical range using 15 nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial control region sequences. Overall genetic differentiation among locations, as revealed by microsatellite data, was highly significant (FST = 0.085, DEST = 0.382, P < 0.001), and pairwise estimates of divergence … 
Chris Chabot|Who's My Daddy? Considerations for the influence of sexual selection on multiple paternity in elasmobranch mating systems|Kady Lyons, Chris L Chabot, Christopher G Mull, Corinne N Paterson Holder, Christopher G Lowe|2017/8|Ecology and evolution|7|15|5603-5612||Polyandry resulting in multiply‐sired litters has been documented in the majority of elasmobranch species examined to date. Although commonly observed, reasons for this mating system remain relatively obscure, especially in batoids. The round stingray (Urobatis halleri) is an abundant, well‐studied elasmobranch distributed throughout the northeastern Pacific that we used to explore hypotheses regarding multiple paternity in elasmobranchs. Twenty mid‐ to late‐term pregnant females were sampled off the coast of southern California and their litters analyzed for the occurrence of multiple paternity using five nuclear microsatellite loci. In addition, embryo sizes and their position within the female reproductive system (i.e., right or left uterus) were recorded and used to make inferences for patterns of ovulation. Multiple paternity was observed in 90% of litters and male reproductive success within litters was relatively … 
Chris Chabot|Low contemporary effective population size detected in the Critically Endangered giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas, due to fisheries overexploitation|Chris L Chabot, Holly A. Hawk, Larry G. Allen|2015|Fisheries Research|172||71-78|Elsevier|The giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas (Polyprionidae), is the largest teleost distributed in the northeastern Pacific from California to northern Mexico and has been overexploited by fisheries for more than a century. As a consequence of this historic exploitation, populations collapsed throughout the region in the last century resulting in the listing of the species as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Recently, numbers of giant sea bass have been increasing within the region due primarily to the banning of the near shore gill net fishery in California waters in 1994. To assess population structure, the impact of historic exploitation on the genetic diversity and effective population size of the species, and to detect signs of recent population expansions, individuals from throughout the northeastern Pacific (n = 61; Northern Channel Islands, CA to San Quintín, Baja California) were sequenced at the mitochondrial control …

Chris Chabot|The genetic diversity and population structure of barred sand bass, Paralabrax nebulifer: a historically important fisheries species off southern and baja california|Corinne N. Paterson, Chris L. Chabot, Jeanne M. Robertson, Brad Erisman, Juan Jose Cota-Nieto, Larry G. Allen|2015|CalCOFI Reports|56||1-13||We examined the contemporary genetic structure of the barred sand bass, Paralabrax nebulifer, a commonly fished species in southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Populations of barred sand bass in southern California have experienced severe declines in numbers over the last decade subsequently leading to severely depressed status of the recreational fishery. Such large population declines can lead to an overall decrease in genetic diversity. The present study examined the genetic diversity in this species (N = 365) using both the control region of the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers for locations throughout California and Baja California. Both markers showed a high degree of genetic diversity and genetic mixing however there is some evidence of structuring between locations north and south of the San Quintin upwelling zone. Despite the weak structuring observed around the … 
Chris Chabot|A baseline investigation into the population structure of white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, in California and Mexican waters using microsatellite DNA analysis|Michael P Franklin, Chris L Chabot, Larry G Allen|2016/8|Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences|115|2|126-136|Southern California Academy of Sciences|The white seabass, Atractoscion nobilis, is a commercially important member of the Sciaenidae that has experienced historic exploitation by fisheries off the coast of southern California. For the present study, we sought to determine the levels of population connectivity among localities distributed throughout the species’ range using nuclear microsatellite markers. Data from the present study have revealed distinct genetic breaks between the Southern California Bight, Pacific Baja California, and the Peninsula of Baja California. 
Chris Chabot|Genetic Diversity, Gene Flow, and Polyandry of Northeastern Pacific Triakid Sharks|Chris Chabot|2013||||||Exploitation of sharks by both commercial and recreational fisheries has caused decreasing numbers resulting in population collapses. Sharks are extremely vulnerable to the effects of exploitation due to life-history characteristics including long lifespans, low fecundities, and late maturities. One family of shark, the Triakidae, has been the subject of global exploitation for greater than 80 years, especially within the eastern Pacific. The Triakidae is a primary component of the eastern Pacific elasmobranch assemblage considered both commercially and recreationally important with several endemic species found within the region including Mustelus albipinnis, M. californicus, M. dorsalis, M. henlei, M. lunulatus, and Triakis semifasciata. In regards to conservation efforts, there is a general paucity of information regarding the status of triakid sharks. As a result of this paucity of information, this study used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to investigate: 1) gene flow among globally distributed populations of the tope shark, Galeorhinus galeus; 2) determine the existence of multiple paternity in M. henlei from within the northern portion of the species' range; and, 3) explore the population connectivity of M. henlei among localities distributed throughout the range of the species from along the northeastern Pacific coast. A lack of gene flow among globally distributed populations of the tope shark, G. galeus from North America, South America, Western Europe, South Africa, and Australia has been observed based on data from thirteen species-specific microsatellite loci. These data support previous patterns of gene flow based on mitochondrial … 
Cecil Robinson|U-Pb-Hf characterization of the central Coast Mountains batholith: Implications for petrogenesis and crustal architecture|M Robinson Cecil, George Gehrels, Mihai N Ducea, P Jonathan Patchett|2011/8/1|Lithosphere|3|4|247-260|Geological Society of America|We present U-Pb geochronologic and Hf isotopic data from 29 plutonic samples within the Coast Mountain batholith, north-coastal British Columbia and southeast Alaska. Hf isotopic values do not correlate with age or variation in magmatic flux, but rather they increase systematically from west (εHf[t] = +2 to +5) to east (εHf[t] = +10 to +13) in response to changing country rock assemblages. By comparing our pluton Hf data with previously reported Nd-Sr and detrital zircon characteristics of associated country rocks, we identify three crustal domains in an area where crustal affinity is largely obscured by metamorphism and voluminous pluton intrusion: (1) a western domain, emplaced into continental-margin strata of the Banks Island assemblage; (2) a central domain, emplaced into the Alexander terrane; and (3) an eastern domain, underlain by the Stikine terrane and its inferred metamorphic equivalents. Between … 
Cecil Robinson|Cenozoic exhumation of the northern Sierra Nevada, California, from (U-Th)/He thermochronology|M Robinson Cecil, Mihai N Ducea, Peter W Reiners, Clement G Chase|2006/11/1|Geological Society of America Bulletin|118|11-12|1481-1488|Geological Society of America|Apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He ages from a 100-km-long range-perpendicular transect in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, are used to constrain the exhumation history of the range since ca. 90 Ma. (U-Th)/He ages in apatite decrease from 80 Ma along the low western range flanks to 46 Ma in the higher elevations to the east. (U-Th)/He ages in zircon also show a weak inverse correlation with elevation, decreasing from 91 Ma in the west to 66 Ma in the east. Rocks near the range crest, sampled at elevations of 2200–2500 m, yield the youngest apatite helium ages (46–55 Ma), whereas zircon helium ages are more uniform across the divide. These data reveal relatively rapid cooling rates between ca. 90 and 60 Ma, which are consistent with relatively rapid exhumation rates of 0.2–0.8 km/m.y., followed by a long period of slower exhumation (0.02–0.04 km/m.y.) from the early Paleogene to today. This is … 
Cecil Robinson|The Fine Gold Intrusive Suite: The roles of basement terranes and magma source development in the Early Cretaceous Sierra Nevada batholith|Jade Star Lackey, M Robinson Cecil, Cameron J Windham, Ryan E Frazer, Ilya N Bindeman, George E Gehrels|2012/4/1|Geosphere|8|2|292-313|Geological Society of America|The Fine Gold Intrusive Suite is one of the largest (>2000 km2) and oldest intrusive complexes in the Sierra Nevada batholith (California, USA), and therefore contains a wealth of information about nascent magmatic processes in a convergent margin arc. Because the suite intrudes both accreted oceanic and/or island-arc terranes and continental crust, it provides perspective on how convergent margin magmatism recycles existing crust versus reworking of fringing island arcs into continental crust. Such insight informs our understanding of how continental crust formation may have operated in the Phanerozoic as compared to earlier in Earth history. New zircon U-Pb geochronology shows that the largely tonalitic suite was emplaced over ∼19 m.y. (124–105 Ma), in three pulses that young from west to east. The most recent domain is nested within the previous ones, such that lobes of magma protruding from … 
Cecil Robinson|Magmatic growth and batholithic root development in the northern Sierra Nevada, California|MR Cecil, GL Rotberg, Mihai N Ducea, JB Saleeby, George E Gehrels|2012/6/1|Geosphere|8|3|592-606|Geological Society of America|In contrast to the much-studied central and southern Sierra Nevada, relatively little is known about the growth and petrogenesis of the batholith in its northern reaches, making it difficult to evaluate range-wide, spatiotemporal trends in batholithic development and the regional extent of eclogite root production and/or loss. New U-Pb ages from northern Sierra plutons reveal a shift between the age of Cretaceous magmatism recorded in the northern Sierra and the timing of an apparent flare-up in the main batholith, indicating that: (1) the northern batholith was more spatially dispersed and emplaced into regions beyond the modern topographic range, and (2) the Cretaceous high-flux event may have occurred over a longer period of time than previously suggested. Relative to the southern Sierra, Nd and Sr isotopic signatures in northern plutons are more primitive, mimicking the predominantly juvenile nature of the … 
Cecil Robinson|Elemental and isotopic evidence for granitoid genesis from deep-seated sources in the Coast Mountains Batholith, British Columbia|James D Girardi, P Jonathan Patchett, Mihai N Ducea, George E Gehrels, M Robinson Cecil, Margaret E Rusmore, Glenn J Woodsworth, David M Pearson, Christian Manthei, Paul Wetmore|2012/4/25|Journal of Petrology|53|7|1505-1536|Oxford University Press|Major element, trace element and Nd–Sr isotopic data are presented for 82 plutonic rocks from the southern Coast Mountains Batholith (CMB) in British Columbia, Canada, ranging in emplacement age from 210 to 50 Ma. The rocks are part of a large composite magmatic arc batholith, which the major element data show to be of calc-alkaline affinity. The majority of CMB samples lack the depletion in Eu that would be consistent with equilibration of magmas and plagioclase-bearing crystalline residues or fractionates, suggesting that equilibration took place deeper than the pressure limit of plagioclase stability at 35–40 km depth. The CMB samples show a wide variation in the slope of normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns, with chondrite-normalized La/Yb ratios above 10 being mostly confined to periods of high magmatic flux in the arc at 160–140, 120–80, and 60–50 Ma. The clearest relationships … 
Cecil Robinson|Provenance of Eocene river sediments from the central northern Sierra Nevada and implications for paleotopography|M Robinson Cecil, Mihai N Ducea, Peter Reiners, George Gehrels, Andreas Mulch, Charlotte Allen, Ian Campbell|2010/12/1|Tectonics|29|6|||[1] Geochronology of fluvial deposits can be used to characterize provenance, the paleotopography of sediment source regions, and the development of regional drainage systems. We present U-Pb and (U-Th)/He ages of detrital zircon grains from Eocene gravels preserved in several paleoriver systems along the western flank of the central and northern Sierra Nevada. These ages allow us to trace the sourcing of detritus in paleorivers and to constrain the evolution of the Sierra Nevada range front. U-Pb zircon age distributions are bimodal, with a dominant peak between 110 and 95 Ma and smaller but significant peaks in the Middle to Late Jurassic, matching the predominant ages of the Sierra Nevada batholith. A small fraction (< 6%) of grains has pre-Mesozoic ages, which consistently match ages from prebatholithic assemblages within the northern part of the range.(U-Th)/He ages of a subset of double-dated … 
Cecil Robinson|Sources of volcanic detritus in the basal Chinle Formation, southwestern Laurentia, and implications for the Early Mesozoic magmatic arc|Nancy R Riggs, ZA Oberling, ER Howell, WG Parker, AP Barth, MR Cecil, JW Martz|2016/4/1|Geosphere|12|2|439-463|Geological Society of America|The Upper Triassic Chinle Formation in southwestern Laurentia is the oldest distinctive record of Early Mesozoic Cordilleran arc magmatism, in the form of detrital zircons and volcanic clasts. Initial deposition of the basal Shinarump and Mesa Redondo members, herein collectively called the Shinarump conglomerate, began in Late Triassic time, yet the earliest known arc magmatism is older by as much as 40 m.y. Analysis of detrital zircons from eight sites in southeastern Nevada, southern Utah, and northeastern Arizona and volcanic-clast zircons from four of these sites provides a basis for understanding the evolution of the Early Mesozoic arc. Most Permian and Triassic detrital zircons from the Shinarump conglomerate have ages from ca. 260 to 220 Ma with rare grains as old as 280 Ma. These ages are compatible with derivation from sources in the magmatic arc to the west and southwest, including … 
Cecil Robinson|Pliocene–Quaternary subsidence and exhumation of the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, California, in response to mantle lithosphere removal|M Robinson Cecil, Z Saleeby, J Saleeby, KA Farley|2014/2/1|Geosphere|10|1|129-147|Geological Society of America|Thermomechanical models of mantle lithosphere removal from beneath the southern Sierra Nevada region, California (USA), predict a complex spatiotemporal pattern of vertical surface displacements. We evaluate these models by using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, together with other paleothermometry estimates, to investigate such topographic transients. We target Tertiary strata from the Kern arch, a crescent-shaped active uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western flank of the southern Sierra Nevada. Kern arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth. Detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Oligocene–Miocene sandstones collected in Kern arch well cores indicate postdepositional heating to temperatures beyond those corresponding with their present burial … 
Cecil Robinson|K–Ca ages of authigenic sediments: examples from Paleozoic glauconite and applications to low-temperature thermochronometry|M Robinson Cecil, Mihai N Ducea|2011/11/1|International Journal of Earth Sciences|100|8|1783-1790|Springer-Verlag|K–Ca ages of Cambrian glauconites from the Llano uplift, central Texas, were determined in order to re-evaluate the ability of the K–Ca system to constrain the timing of deposition of sedimentary packages. All of the K–Ca ages presented here were found to be younger than their stratigraphic ages. In addition to being too young, the K–Ca ages are also highly variable, ranging in age from Silurian to Permian. The oldest subset of glauconite ages are in agreement with previously published Rb–Sr ages from the same outcrop and provide further evidence for there having been a post-depositional thermal or recrystallization event that reset both the Rb–Sr and K–Ca systems. The range of younger glauconite K–Ca ages is similar to the distribution of available apatite fission track ages for the Llano basement. K–Ca ages are interpreted as thermochronologic data reflecting partial retention of Ca in thermally … 
Cecil Robinson|Paleotopography of the central-northern Sierra Nevada and implications for uplift and tilting of the Sierran block|M Robinson Cecil, Mihai N Ducea, Peter W Reiners, George E Gehrels, Andreas Mulch, Charlotte M Allen, Ian H Campbell|2010/5/28|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|42|4|81||Because of its high elevations and rugged relief, the Sierra Nevada has commonly been considered an example of youthful topography, yet available paleoaltimetric and thermochronologic data suggest topographic antiquity of the range. We address this issue by using the geo-and thermo-chronology of Eocene fluvial deposits, preserved along the western flank of the central and northern Sierra Nevada, to trace the sourcing of detritus in paleoriver systems and to constrain the development of the Sierra Nevada range front. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the ancestral Yuba, American, Mokelumne, and Stanislaus Rivers, are measured with the aim of constraining the paleotopography of source regions, and the development of regional drainage systems. U-Pb ages are bimodal, with a dominant age peak between~ 110–90 Ma, and lesser, but significant, peaks in the Jurassic (between~ 170 and 150 Ma), a distribution that matches that of pluton ages in the central and northern Sierra. Pre-Mesozoic aged grains represent a small fraction (up to 6%) of the total population from a given sample locality, and are a good match to local metasedimentary belts. A subset of zircons (n= 11) from one locality were double-dated using U-Pb and (U-Th)/He methods. Zircon crystallization ages range from~ 2500 Ma to 90 Ma and have corresponding (U-Th)/He ages which do not correlate with U-Pb age, and which range from 114 Ma to 74 Ma, consistent with cooling ages reported for the northern Sierra Nevada. Our results suggest that Eocene rivers were sourced locally within the Sierra and were likely shorter, steeper, and draining smaller catchments than was … 
Cecil Robinson|Stratigraphic analysis of Eocene river systems: Implications for the Cenozoic uplift history of the Sierra Nevada, California|M Robinson CECIL|2004/11/7|2004 Denver Annual Meeting|||||Stratigraphic analyses of paleochannel deposits located on the northwestern slopes of the Sierra Nevada suggest that early Cenozoic landsculpting processes varied markedly and that Eocene river systems were capable of moving large amounts of coarse material. Such analyses contradict the conventional idea that Sierra Nevadan landscape was characterized by low elevation, low relief features formed by broad, low-gradient river systems prior to Neogene uplift. In fact, the nature of Eocene fluvial deposits in the northern Sierra Nevada is consistent with a landscape of higher elevation and paleostream systems that varied climatically. Material from deepest thalwegs of the ancestral Yuba River is dominated by well-rounded, cobbled-sized clasts suggesting that Eocene river systems had gradients sufficient to move large clasts appreciable distances. In at least four locations, rounded boulders with b-axis diameters of 1-3 m were present in these thalweg deposits. These sediments characterize a non-steady state Paleogene Sierra Nevada of significant elevation and relief. Additionally, paleostream deposits of the ancestral Yuba River reveal multiple episodes of downcutting and backfilling. Such variation in sedimentological regime requires a variation in stream power, something which is generally caused by either surface tilting or a change in discharge. A documented shift in Cenozoic climate toward cooler, stormier conditions (Molnar and England, 1990; Wolfe, 1994) would have a great impact on discharge and, consequently, stream power. A changing climatic regime, therefore, is capable of not only explaining the episodic erosional and … 
Cecil Robinson|Along‐Strike Variation in the Magmatic Tempo of the Coast Mountains Batholith, British Columbia, and Implications for Processes Controlling Episodicity in Arcs|MR Cecil, ME Rusmore, George E Gehrels, GJ Woodsworth, HH Stowell, IN Yokelson, C Chisom, M Trautman, E Homan|2018/11|Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|19|11|4274-4289||The growth of the Coast Mountains batholith has been documented as episodic through time, and it has become a type example of a continental arc system that developed through non‐steady‐state magmatism. The magmatic record, however, is not well known along the length of the arc, hindering evaluation of the processes controlling the tempo and patterns of batholith growth. A new, robust geochronologic database (485 U‐Pb zircon and titanite ages, 120 of which are newly presented herein) covering nearly 1,000 km of arc length reveals significant along‐strike variation in the tempo of batholith emplacement, the timing of arc cessation, and the arc cooling history. Zircon ages range from ~180 to 40 Ma along the length of the arc and overlap with titanite ages, with the exception of parts of the central batholith where Eocene extension and exhumation of lower crustal rocks led to a more complex history. New … 
Cecil Robinson|Igniting the Sierran arc: Evolving oxygen and hafnium isotope ratios in the Bass Lake tonalite|Jade Star Lackey, M Robinson Cecil, Cameron J Windham, RE Frazer, Ilya N Bindeman, George E Gehrels|2010/5/29|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|42|4|110||Much recent insight into the construction of Cordilleran batholiths comes from detailed studies of the emplacement histories of individual plutons in the eastern Sierra Nevada Batholith (SNB), yet there is growing recognition of the importance of long-term orogenic cyclicity as a control of magmatism (DeCelles et al. 2009, Nat. Geosci.). Thus, greater whole-arc perspective is needed to evaluate the interplay of long-term variations in magma source and short-term controls of plutonic emplacement. To help bridge these viewpoints, by improving our understanding of magmatism in the nascent Sierran arc, we have conducted a regional study of the~ 2000 km 2 Bass Lake tonalite in the west-central SNB. Zircon (Zrc) from the BLT has been analyzed for δ 18 O by laser fluorination of bulk zircon concentrates. Single crystal U-Pb age and Hf isotope ratios are measured by MC-LA-ICP-MS. BLT zircons show magmatic zoning in CL, and U-Pb ages (103-121 Ma; n= 17) are largely concordant with minimal inheritance. Older (> 112 Ma) rocks are found west of the Oakhurst roof pendant and in a domain near Yosemite; younger (103–110) sections of the BLT extend east and southeast of the Oakhurst pendant, substantially expanding the Oakhurst “pluton” of Bateman (1992, USGS Prof. Pap.). The temporal and spatial pattern of U-Pb ages demonstrates two major episodes of incremental emplacement of the BLT. 
Cecil Robinson|Development and application of geochronometric techniques to the study of Sierra Nevada uplift and the dating of authigenic sediments|Mary Robinson Cecil|2009|||||The University of Arizona.|This dissertation contains studies that use various geochronometric and thermochronometric techniques to better understand the post-magmatic evolution of Sierra Nevada, California. (U-Th)/He ages in apatite and zircon from Sierran batholithic rocks are used to constrain the Cenozoic exhumation of the northern part of the range. Zircon and apatite ages determined from the same samples revealed relatively rapid cooling and exhumation rates (0.2 - 0.8 km/My) from ~ 90 to 60 Ma, followed by tectonic quiescence and slow exhumation (0.02 - 0.04 km/My) from the late Paleocene to present. In addition to the thermochronology of basement lithologies, the detrital zircon geochronology of grains from preserved Eocene fluvial sediments in the central and northern Sierra Nevada was performed. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the deposits were found to have distributions closely matching age-area estimates of Mesozoic plutons in the Sierra Nevada, suggesting that Eocene river systems were draining local Sierran catchments and likely had steeper axial gradients than has been proposed. Provenance analysis of the Eocene sediments is used to provide constraints on the paleotopography of the Sierra Nevada and inferred range-wide Cenozoic uplift.In addition to the Sierra Nevada work, this dissertation also contains studies that focus on the development of the K-Ca system as a geochronometric technique suitable for dating the deposition of sedimentary sequences. We present a new method for measuring Ca isotopic ratios using a multi-collector ICP-MS equipped with a hexapole collision cell. Isobaric argon interferences are minimized via gas … 
Cecil Robinson|Constraining landscape evolution in the Sierra Nevada through detrital zircon provenance analysis of Cenozoic fluvial sediments|M Robinson CECIL|2007/10/30|2007 GSA Denver Annual Meeting|||||U-Pb analyses of single zircon grains from Cenozoic fluvial deposits found on the western flank of the Sierra Nevada provide temporal and spatial constraints on the development of a Sierran range front. There has been considerable recent debate surrounding the timing and magnitude of bedrock and surface uplift of the Sierra Nevada. Traditional models have the bulk of surface uplift occurring in the last 3–5 Myr, while a collection of recent studies support a model of the Sierra Nevada existing as a topographic range throughout the Cenozoic. We use the provenance of detrital zircon grains deposited in fluvial sediments in the central and northern parts of the range to test these two end-member models of Sierran landscape development. Zircon grains with age signatures from basement terranes east of the modern Sierra support the traditional model of a low-elevation, low-relief landscape pre-Neogene uplift. Zircon grain populations with a dominant Sierra-age signature support a model of sustained high Cenozoic topography and an existing range front near to or the same as the modern drainage divide. Preliminary results from sands within the Eocene gold-bearing gravel deposits indicate that the majority of grains (~ 94%) are of Sierran-arc affinity, with ages ranging between 91 and 166 Ma. Relatively few grains (~ 5%) are Precambrian in age. The youngest zircon (s) in a sample are Eocene (40Ma) and are used to constrain the maximum age of deposition. Because of the paucity of Precambrian zircons, there are no statistically significant old age peaks, which is problematic as those old ages may make it possible to distinguish between … 
Cecil Robinson|Geologic and stratigraphic context of paleoflora from Eocene river systems, Northern Sierra Nevada, California|MR Cecil, CG Chase, JA Wolfe|2007|COURIER-FORSCHUNGSINSTITUT SENCKENBERG|258||119|FOTOMECHANISCHE WIEDERGABE NUR MIT AUSDRUECKLICHER|Stratigraphic analyses of paleochannel deposits located on the northwestern slopes of the Sierra Nevada suggest that early Cenozoic landsculpting processes were highly variable and that the Eocene river systems were capable of moving large amounts of coarse material. Such analyses contradict the conventional idea that the Eocene Sierra Nevadan landscape was characterized by low elevation, low relief features formed by broad, low-gradient river systems prior to Neogene uplift. In fact, the nature of Eocene fluvial deposits in the northern Sierra Nevada is consistent with a landscape of higher elevation and paleostream systems that varied with climate. Material from deepest thalwegs of the ancestral Yuba River is dominated by large (cobble-sized), well-rounded clasts, suggesting that Eocene river systems had gradients sufficient to move large clasts appreciable distances. In at least four locations, rounded boulders with b-axis diameters of 1-3 m were present in these thalweg deposits. Additionally, paleostream deposits of the ancestral Yuba River reveal multiple episodes of downcutting and backfilling. Such variation in sedimentological regime requires a variation in stream power, something which is generally caused by either surface tilting or a change in discharge. Changing climatic regimes may be capable of explaining some of the episodic erosional and depositional features preserved in the Eocene paleovalleys independent of tectonic uplift or tilting, but the paleogradient calculations present more intense challenges. Leaves preserved in some of the finer-grained Eocene gravels were suitable for studies of paleoaltimetry using leaf …

Fourteen new zircon U-Pb ages from the El Paso Mountains and Lane Mountain region of the Mojave Desert record nearly continuous magmatism occurring between ca. 275 and 240 Ma. These ages, which are taken to record the onset of subduction-related magmatism along the southwestern Laurentian margin, are older than the earliest arc plutons documented in the southern Sierra Nevada region to the north and in the Transverse Ranges to the south. They overlap, however, with Permian arc plutons documented in Sonora, Mexico. Dated plutons are compositionally variable, but can be characterized as intermediate to felsic, calcic to calc …

WADDINGTON REGION, SOUTHERN COAST MOUNTAINS BATHOLITH, BRITISH COLUMBIA|Charles CHISOM, M Robinson CECIL, Margaret E RUSMORE, Glenn J WOODSWORTH|2014/10/21|2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia|||||Although arc magmatic patterns have been closely studied in the central and northern Coast Mountains batholith (~ 52–54 N; eg Gehrels et al., 2009), the geochronology and spatial distribution of plutons in the southern Coast Mountains batholith are not well known. In this study, we aim to constrain the magmatic history of the batholith at the latitude of Mt Waddington (~ 50 N). New zircon U-Pb ages from nine plutons help define the eastward migration the magmatic front, delineate the locus of Late Cretaceous magmatism, constrain the timing of deformation in the core of the orogen, and contribute to estimates of magmatic flux from Late Jurassic through Early Tertiary time. Samples were collected from a~ 100 km long NE-trending transect up Knight Inlet and past Mt. Waddington,~ 75 km northwest of the area discussed by Rusmore et al., this meeting. Samples range in age from Late Jurassic to Eocene and vary in their composition and relation to major deformation events. Plutons in the westernmost part of the transect consist of slightly altered quartz diorite. East of these, we find epidote-bearing tonalites that appear similar to mid-Cretaceous plutons in the northern batholith. Samples from the core of the batholith include orthogneiss with a protomylonitc fabric, the sill-shaped Tiedemann intrusion from the Waddington massif, and large plutons that cut the Late Cretaceous eastern Waddington thrust belt and are early Tertiary in age. Cathodoluminescence imaging reveals distinctive zonation patterns and a wide variety of zircon morphologies. Samples from the central part of the transect, which record the greatest amount of deformation, have …

Plutonic and metamorphic rocks of the CMB comprise a northwest-trending belt that straddles and obscures the boundary between two large Paleozoic-early Mesozoic composite terranes. The southern CMB is an ideal location for investigating the influence of upper plate tectonism on subduction-related magmatism through an integrated geochronological, geochemical, structural and petrologic approach. Mapping and sampling of plutonic bodies in Lochbourough and Bute Inlets in June 2014 confirm that the area is dominated by large plutonic bodies with subordinate metasedimentary and metavolcanic pendants, as shown by Roddick and Woodsworth (2007). Compositions of plutonic bodies range from granitic to dioritic. Plutons are mostly homogeneous, un-foliated and medium to coarse-grained equigranular; these we split into map units by rock type. There are also heterogeneous bodies, the main ones being tonalite-diorite in composition that shows diorite seemingly intruded by massive outcrops of homogeneous tonalite. These bodies were mapped as tonalite-diorite complexes. Our objectives for fieldwork were to collect samples for zircon geochronology and Hf geochemistry analyses, as well as map and classify plutons. In order to categorize pluton bodies we sampled in three or more locations in each major pluton body, once for U-Pb geochronology and Hf geochemistry and the rest for petrologic studies.

This previous work established the foundation for our investigation into the influence of crustal deformation on episodic magmatism in large continental arcs. Plutonic rocks dominate the batholith in our study area from Bute Inlet to Mt Waddington, and most are similar to two previously dated Late Jurassic plutons on Bute Inlet and elsewhere in the CMB. A few small bodies may be Late Cretaceous, but the widespread post-100 Ma magmatism found in much of the batholith appears to be absent on Bute Inlet. The Late Jurassic (?) plutons intrude an amphibolite-facies schist with quartzofeldspathic sedimentary and mafic volcanic (?) protoliths. The NE-edge of the schist body is composed of markedly lower grade and less deformed mafic metavolcanic rocks with relic clastic and pillowed textures and a distinctive rhyolitic body. These lower grade rocks resemble the Hauterivian Ottarasko volcanics found in the eastern Waddington thrust belt NE of Bute Inlet. Four large ductile shear zones are present on Bute Inlet. Two of these, in the SW part of the inlet, were previously unrecognized and show sinistral-oblique sense of shear in the field. Regionally, these shear zones may join shear zones mapped by Monger near Vancouver. In the northern part of the inlet, two previously recognized NW-striking shear zones are steeply dipping reverse faults and may belong to the Late Cretaceous eastern Waddington thrust belt. Minor NE-striking high-angle faults disrupt the structures and plutons …

We evaluate these models by using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, together with other paleothermometry estimates, to investigate such topographic transients. We target sediments from the Kern Arch, a fan-shaped uplift located in the southeastern San Joaquin Basin, along the western flank of the southern Sierra. Kern Arch stratigraphy provides a unique record of subsidence and exhumation in a sensitive region immediately adjacent to the delaminating mantle lithosphere at depth. Detrital apatite (U-Th)/He ages from Oligo-Miocene sandstones collected in Kern Arch well cores indicate post-depositional heating to temperatures beyond those corresponding with their present burial depths.

Cecil Robinson|Temporal relations of three dimensional mantle lithosphere delamination resolved in southeastern Great Valley's subsidence-uplift history, Sierra Nevada Microplate, California|Zorka Saleeby, M Robinson Cecil, Jason Saleeby|2012|Abstracts with Programs-Geological Society of America|44|7|490|Geological Society of America|A synthesis of geophysical and geological data suggests that the eclogitic (arclogite) mantle lithosphere root that formed during Cretaceous arc magmatism beneath the southern Sierra Nevada (SN) and adjacent Great Valley (GV) has progressively delaminated in E to W, and subsequently in S to N directions during Pliocene-Quaternary time. Thermo-mechanical modeling predicts km-scale subsidence/uplift transients through the course of delamination. The current delamination hinge runs along the southeastern margin of the GV, and turns westwards towards the axial southernmost GV. The Tulare (sub-) basin of the GV lies west of the delamination hinge, above the area of lower crustal attachment of the residual arclogite root, with the delaminated portion of the root hinging down to the east and south into the underlying mantle. The “center” of Tulare basin records ~700 m of anomalous Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic subsidence, which occurred mainly during the E to W phase of delamination. The southern margin of Tulare basin is uplifted and eroded along the Kern Arch, a Quaternary epeirogenic uplift zone that continues eastwards into the western Sierra, where GPS monuments record the most rapid contemporary uplift rates of the entire SN. The southern segment of the delamination hinge curves westward and runs along the transition between Tulare basin and the Arch.

Rocks near the range crest, sampled at elevations of 2200-2500 m, yield the youngest apatite helium ages (46–55 Ma), whereas zircon helium ages are more uniform across the divide. These data reveal relatively rapid cooling rates between~ 90 and 60 Ma that are consistent with relatively rapid exhumation rates of 0.2–0.8 km/My, followed by a long period of slower exhumation (0.02–0.04 km/My) from the early Paleogene to today. This is reflected in the lowrelief morphology of the northern Sierra Nevada, where an Eocene erosional surface has long been identified. A long period of slow exhumation is also consistent with welldocumented, widespread lateritic paleosols at the base of Eocene depositional units. Laterites preserved in the northern Sierra Nevada are the product of intense weathering in a subtropical environment and suggest an enduring, soil-mantled topography. We

We present U-Pb detrital zircon ages from the deposits, which allows us to trace the sourcing of paleorivers and to constrain the spatial and temporal development of a Sierran range front. The distribution of zircon ages in most samples is bimodal, with a dominant age peak between 110 and 90 Ma and a smaller, but significant peak occurring in the mid to late Jurassic. Our age distribution patterns match closely with apparent magmatic flux events in the central and northern Sierra Nevada, indicating that detrital zircons are of Sierran arc affinity. With the exception of one sample, which was collected in close proximity to the Devonian Lake Bowman batholith, fewer than 5% of all sample grain populations have pre-Mesozoic ages. This … 
Cecil Robinson|New Analytical Developments in K-Ca Geochronology Using MC-ICP-MS|M Cecil, M Ducea|2007/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||While the decay of 40K to 40Ar has been used extensively in geochronology, the other arm of this branched decay, the beta decay of 40K to 40Ca, has received much less attention, despite the system's potential application to important geologic problems. Unfortunately, measuring calcium isotopic ratios has proven to be challenging with conventional single collector TIMS instruments given the relative signal intensity of 40Ca with respect to all other calcium isotopes. Additionally, TIMS analyses take many hours (and a steady signal) to complete and the thermal source does a relatively poor job of ionizing calcium. Here we present a technique that make it possible to precisely and reproducibly measure calcium isotopic ratios in solution using a multicollector ICP-MS. The success of this technique was predicated upon overcoming two significant analytical problems: 1) the interference of argon (the carrier gas) at …

This stage immediately follows implacement of the youngest plutons in the northern Sierra and indicates a period of intense erosional denudation associated with crustal thickening and orogenic shortening of the ancestral range.

One way to predict these changes in the future is to study warming events in the geologic past. The main control of Earth's temperature over geologic time is the concentration of atmospheric CO2; however, the precise relationship between CO2 and temperature is not fully understood. Therefore, it is essential to be able to quantify atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the geologic past, especially at times of rapid climate change analogous to current atmospheric changes. One widely applied proxy relates the carbon isotopic composition of pedogenic carbonates to atmospheric pCO2, but one of the key variables (soil-respired CO2; S[z]) is not well constrained. This study presents a new proxy where soil-respired CO2 is related to mean annual precipitation (MAP) by the following equation: S(z) = 5.67 …

One way to examine the relationship between vegetation and climate is to study the isotopic composition of organic carbon preserved in paleosols. Paleosols that preserve organic matter in the form of carbonaceous root traces provide direct evidence of the proportion of C3 to C4 biomass that grew in the soil, in contrast with pedogenic carbonate δ13C values, which may also reflect complicating factors including mixing from atmospheric δ13C in low productivity ecosystems. A high temporal and spatial resolution reconstruction of past ecosystems was derived from thirty-five paleosols in a thirty-four meter section of the Sixmile Creek Formation at Timber Hills, Montana (USA) that was deposited during the Miocene (10.2–8.9 Ma ago).

We predict the spatial variability of grass δ13C in North America using a mean of three different methods of classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning techniques and nine climatic variables. We show that growing season precipitation and temperature are the strongest predictors of all single climate variables. We apply this CART analysis to high-resolution gridded climate data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project …

Recent work from terrestrial sections in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrates that the period was characterized by different responses in the terrestrial and marine realms, suggesting that traditional causal mechanisms may not adequately explain the dynamics of the early Eocene climatic optimum. Here, we present a new high-resolution multiproxy record of terrestrial climatic and environmental conditions during the early Eocene climatic optimum from the Southern Hemisphere and compare this reconstruction to other marine and terrestrial records. Similar to Northern Hemisphere terrestrial records, there is a transient peak period of atmospheric carbon isotope enrichment as well as increased temperatures and precipitation, which indicate that terrestrial … 
Cotton Jennifer|Climate controls on soil respired CO2 in the United States: implications for 21st century chemical weathering rates in temperate and arid ecosystems|Jennifer M Cotton, M Louise Jeffery, Nathan D Sheldon|2013/11/4|Chemical Geology|358||37-45|Elsevier|The most recent IPCC (2007) report predicts that regional-scale precipitation patterns will change significantly in the 21st century as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2. The amount of respired CO2 stored in the soil atmosphere is heavily influenced by climate, and the concentration of CO2 in soils controls the concentration of dissolved CO2 ([CO2aq]) in pore water involved in chemical weathering. Therefore, we can expect changes to chemical weathering rates as a result of climate change, which can influence the global carbon cycle through the consumption of CO2 during continental silicate weathering. These changes may even be important on human timescales. To predict changes to the [CO2aq] of soil water, we have produced an extensive literature review of soil respired CO2 measurements to study the spatial variability of soil respired CO2. We show that respired CO2 concentrations and [CO2aq] vary … 
Cotton Jennifer|Terrestrial evidence for a two-stage mid-Paleocene biotic event|Ethan G Hyland, Nathan D Sheldon, Jennifer M Cotton|2015/1/1|Palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology|417||371-378|Elsevier|Marine records of the Paleocene indicate a series of hyperthermal events characterized by significant climatic and carbon cycle variability, but there are few comparable continental records. The mid-Paleocene biotic event (MPBE) is a recently described interval defined by a rapid negative carbon isotope excursion and major short-term changes in marine ecosystems, but it is as yet unclear whether the event was globally important. Here we present the first terrestrial paleoenvironmental record of the MPBE based on paleosols that document rapid and short-lived increases in temperature and precipitation and resultant shifts in plant assemblages concomitant with substantial carbon isotope excursions. The new record indicates that carbon cycle changes during the early late Paleocene may have resulted in a two-stage transient hyperthermal event that caused a significant perturbation to both the regional climate and … 
Cotton Jennifer|Multi‐century stasis in C3 and C4 grass distributions across the contiguous United States since the industrial revolution|Daniel M Griffith, Jennifer M Cotton, Rebecca L Powell, Nathan D Sheldon, Christopher J Still|2017/11|Journal of biogeography|44|11|2564-2574||Aims Understanding the functional response of ecosystems to past global change is crucial to predicting performance in future environments. One sensitive and functionally significant attribute of grassland ecosystems is the percentage of species that use the C4 versus C3 photosynthetic pathway. Grasses using C3 and C4 pathways are expected to have different responses to many aspects of anthropogenic environmental change that have followed the industrial revolution, including increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2, changes to land management and fire regimes, precipitation seasonality, and nitrogen deposition. In spite of dramatic environmental changes over the past 300 years, it is unknown if the C4 grass percentage in grasslands has shifted. Location Contiguous United States of America. Methods Here, we used stable carbon isotope data (i.e. δ13C) from 30 years of soil samples, as well as …

Paleoenvironmental reconstructions coupled with mammalian fossil assemblages from the Crowder and Cajon Valley formations in the Mojave Desert, California, contribute insights into local-scale (10s of kilometers) responses to warming during the Hemingfordian and Barstovian North American Land Mammal Ages. By integrating lithological descriptions, phytolith analyses, carbon isotope composition of preserved soil organic matter (δ13CSOM), and elemental geochemistry of paleosols, we provide reconstructions of depositional environments, vegetation, and precipitation through the MCO. Phytolith and δ13CSOM evidence suggest that …

Warming was triggered by a massive release of 13 C depleted carbon to the atmosphere, evidenced by negative carbon isotope excursions (CIE) in nearly every carbon pool on Earth. Differences in these CIEs can give insight into the response of different ecosystems to perturbations in the carbon cycle. Here we present records of δ 13 C cc of pedogenic carbonates and δ 13 C org from preserved soil organic matter in corresponding paleosols to understand changes to soil carbon during the PETM. CIEs during the event are larger in pedogenic carbonates than preserved organic matter for corresponding paleosols at three sites across two continents. The difference in the CIEs within soil carbon pools can be explained … 
Cotton Jennifer|Using Soils to Constrain Past and Future Terrestrial Climate Change.|Jennifer M Cotton|2013||||||Future ecosystem and climatic changes due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are of increasing importance to society. Soils are the largest terrestrial reservoir of carbon, have the potential to become new sources or sinks of carbon to the atmosphere, and also can record information about climate and environment. In this dissertation, I use modern and ancient soil to constrain past and future climate and environmental change. To better determine the sensitivity of ecosystems to changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate, we must first increase the precision of past atmospheric CO2 reconstructions. I have developed a new proxy for soil-respired CO2 based on its relationship with precipitation to reduce the uncertainties in the soil carbonate paleobarometer, the most widely applicable method of atmospheric CO2 reconstructions. Using this new method of paleobarometry, I have refined previous estimates of atmospheric CO2 and find estimates now support CO2-temperature coupling throughout the Phanerozoic. This new respired CO2 proxy is also useful for predictions of carbon cycle changes. Silicate weathering consumes atmospheric CO2, and the concentration of soil CO2 is an important factor in weathering rates. Here, I couple the newly derived relationship to precipitation simulations from regional climate models to predict future changes to soil CO2 and the concentration of dissolved CO2. I find large increases in dissolved CO2 for the central Great Plains region and moderate decreases for the Southwestern United States for the decade of 2050-2060, indicating that the Great Plains may become a new sink for atmospheric CO2 in the future …

However, there is a limited knowledge about the controls on plant wax integration and transport in large catchments with multiple biomes and climates. To address this lack of understanding, we investigated the vegetation and climatic controls on plant wax integration and transport from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the largest river in the U.S., to the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We first estimated the geographic distribution of n-alkane carbon (δ13Calk) and hydrogen (δ2Halk) isotopic compositions (i.e. isoscapes) in the MRB using plant isotope fractionation calibrations from North America and similar climate regions for the pre-industrial. We utilize two different vegetation maps (i.e. biome map and %C4 map) and two plant isotope fractionation estimation approaches … 
Cotton Jennifer|Assessing earth system model predictions of C4 grass cover in North America: From the glacial era to the end of this century|Christopher J Still, Jennifer M Cotton, Daniel M Griffith|2019/1|Global Ecology and Biogeography|28|2|145-157||Aim C4 grasses are distinct from C3 grasses, because C4 grasses respond in a different manner to light, temperature, CO2 and nitrogen and often have higher resource‐use efficiencies. C3 and C4 grasses are typically represented in earth system models (ESMs) by different plant functional types (PFTs). The ability of ESMs to capture C4 grass biogeography and ecology across differing time periods is important to assess, given the crucial role they play in ecosystems and their divergent responses to global change. Location North America. Time periods Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), historical modern period (ca. 1850) and end of this century. Major taxa studied C4 grasses. Methods Proxy data representing relative cover and productivity of C4 grasses were collated, including carbon isotope ratios of soil carbon and animal grazer tissue, and vegetation plot data in undisturbed grasslands. We selected available …

In this work, we utilize deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) remains from a barn owl cave site on Santa Barbara Island in the Channel Islands National Park as a long-term record of such changes. Using stable isotopic methods, we aim to reconstruct local climate and environmental change over the last 1500 years (ages determined by radiocarbon dating). To do so, we analyze deer mouse bone collagen for stable oxygen (d 18 O), carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopic compositions. Because" you are what you eat", these small mammals construct body tissues, including collagen, that record the stable isotopic value of consumed food and water, which in turn reflects the surrounding environment. Oxygen isotope values of bone … 
Cotton Jennifer|Assessing the use of small mammal isotopes as paleoclimatic proxies: case studies from the Pacific Northwest and Southern California|JM Cotton, TM Smiley, NR Packard, MJ Jimenez, RC Terry|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Small mammals record many aspects of their diet and thus local environment in their tissues via stable isotopes. The isotopic composition of extant small mammals has been shown to track climate and environmental gradients; however, these relationships have rarely been applied to the past. Small mammals are ubiquitous in the fossil record and represent a potentially useful and currently under-utilized proxy for climate and environmental change. Key questions remain about the spatial scale represented by small-mammal isotopes and the aspects of the environment that they record. Here, we aim to characterize the climatic and environmental variables recorded in small mammal delta 18 O and delta 2 H. We analyzed deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) hair samples from specimens collected over the past 100 years from natural history museums across the country. We targeted specimens from two regions of … 
Cotton Jennifer|Using stable isotopes to track the effects of deforestation on small-mammal ecology in the Pacific Northwest over the last 100 years|Natalie Rose Packard, Jennifer M Cotton, Tara M Smiley, Rebecca C Terry|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Landscape, land-use, and climate change are important factors in determining ecosystem change over a range of spatio-temporal scales. For example, within small-mammal communities, the spread of agriculture, rapid urbanization, and deforestation have been shown to alter species composition and diet, thus potentially disrupting ecological interactions and reshaping ecosystems. Small mammals integrate the isotopic composition of their diet and drinking water into their hair and therefore serve as useful proxies for vegetation and water resources in their habitat. To better understand how forest loss and land-cover change influence small-mammal ecology in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), we analyzed the hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotopic composition of hair from historical Peromyscus maniculatus (North American deer mouse) specimens housed in natural history museums across the country.

To investigate these impacts, we leverage extensive historical collections of small mammals, which can serve as indicators of past and modern ecosystem change. Here, we use the stable isotopic composition of hair from Peromyscus maniculatus, a widespread generalist rodent, to better understand the influence of urbanization over the last 100 years. The stable isotopic composition of small-mammal diets are recorded in the hair of these historical specimens, thereby providing a long-term record of climate and environmental change. Carbon isotopes (delta13C) can inform about the vegetation composition of an animal's diet, while nitrogen isotopes (delta15N) offer a view into agriculture signatures and atmospheric … 
Cotton Jennifer|Climate change drives a northward expansion of C4 grasses in North America by the end of the century|JM Cotton, TM Mosier, TE Cerling, JR Ehleringer, KA Hoppe, CJ Still|2016/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||C4 grasses currently cover 18% of the earth's surface and are critically important as food sources, and account for roughly 25% of terrestrial productivity. Yet in the future these patterns will change as a result of the opposing impacts of atmospheric CO2 and climate on C3 and C4 physiologies. Here, we use the carbon isotope ratio (d13C) of modern and fossil bison and mammoth tissues as a proxy for the abundance of C3 and C4 vegetation across North American habitats. We then combine stable isotope data with CMIP5 climate model simulations, and used eight different climatic predictor variables and advanced statistical techniques to model the spatial distributions of C3 and C4 grasses from today through the year 2100 for two fossil-fuel emissions scenarios. For both scenarios, our vegetation model predicts increases in C4 grass abundance of up to 50% in the northern Great Plains and moderate decreases in … 
Cotton Jennifer|Bringing organic carbon isotopes and phytoliths to the table as additional constraints on paleoelevation|ND Sheldon, JM Cotton, MT Hren, EG Hyland, SY Smith, CAE Strömberg|2015/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||A commonly used tool in paleotectonic and paleoaltimetry studies is the oxygen isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates formed that formed in lakes or soils, with both spatial (eg, shoreline to mountain top) or temporally resolved records potentially providing constraints. However, in many cases there is a substantial spread in the oxygen isotope data for a given time period, often to the point of allowing for essentially any interpretation of the data depending upon how they have been used by the investigator. One potential way of distinguishing between different potential paleotectonic or paleoaltimetric interpretations is to use carbon isotope and plant microfossil (phytolith) analyses from the same paleosols to screen the oxygen isotope data by looking for evidence of evaporative enrichment. For example, if both inorganic (carbonate) and organic carbon isotopes are measured from the same paleosol, then in it …

Here we present a class project designed to increase student involvement and quantitative analysis skills in a large enrollment lecture geared towards nonscience majors. We use the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of hair to teach students about the impacts of industrial agriculture through quantitative assessment of diet in an environmental science course. Assessment of student learning, which was determined through exam questions and also through a feedback questionnaire, was overwhelmingly positive, demonstrating the usefulness of this technique in bringing active learning to the large enrollment classroom.

Cotton Jennifer|BULK PLANT AND SINGLE ORGAN CARBON ISOTOPIC VARIABILITY ALONG A PRECIPITATION GRADIENT|Christie L WILKINS|2011/10/12|2011 GSA Annual Meeting in Minneapolis|||||Plant fractionation of carbon isotopes during the uptake and fixation of CO 2 varies as a function of climate, but the extent and dependence of this variability on environmental conditions is not well understood. In a large-scale study of the variability of plant δ 13 C with precipitation, Diefendorf et al.,(2010) found an isotopic shift to heavier values in drier environments. In this study we investigate the isotopic variability that occurs in C 3 plants and focus on a precipitation gradient limited to less than 1000 mm/yr. We also investigate the carbon isotopic variability in individual plant organs and how this contributes to the overall isotopic variability in C 3 photosynthesis of a particular environment. We find a weak trend with the average isotopic composition of C 3 plants at a given site, with heavier isotopic values being related to decreasing precipitation. This trend is less pronounced than the isotopic shift observed by Diefendorf et al.(2010) and Kohn (2010). While the larger dataset was only weakly correlated with MAP, our analyses reveal a negative correlation between MAP and δ 13 C for gymnosperms (R 2= 0.60), which is potentially useful for paleoprecipitation reconstructions. We also find a significant amount of isotopic variability among individual plant organs, up to 5‰ in some species. This inter-organ variability has significant implications for paleoclimatology and paleovegetation reconstructions.

The ultrabasic, highly reducing conditions unique to these springs result from local serpentinization. Gases bubbling from the springs are mainly composed of methane, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Serpentinization is a process characteristic of early Earth, Mars and Titan that is thought to produce abiogenic hydrocarbons as well as provide geochemical energy for chemolithotrophic life. Methane, CO2, hydrogen and nitrogen were detected in the aqueous phases.

Long-term cooling commenced after the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (52 to 50 Ma), culminating in the Oi-1 glacial maximum (~ 33.65 Ma)(Miller et al., 1991; Zachos et al., 2001; Bohaty and Zachos, 2003). This event reflects a transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse world and is recorded in the marine realm as a stepped positive δ18O shift in benthic and planktonic foraminifera (Coxall et al., 2005; Katz et al., 2008; Pearson et al., 2008; Lear et al., 2008). Reported here is a δ18O record across the continental Eocene/Oligocene transition (EOT). The record derived from V. lentus displays 3 cycles followed by a positive δ18O shift across Oi-1 with subsequent recovery to pre-Oi-1 values. Within these cycles, plus across the isotope shift and recovery, δ18O values change in magnitude between 1.4–1.8‰. If entirely due to temperature this would equate to a 6–13 C (depending on calibration) temperature variation, which according to its high magnitude, implies a contribution from another factor, such as changes in the isotopic composition of the host water in which V. lentus grew. The ultimate control on this is likely to be related to changes in global ice volume. The V. lentus δ18O Oi-1 shift and recovery are comparable to that seen in the marine record. Furthermore, in cycle 1 the most positive δ18O value corresponds with the Late Eocene Event as observed in the marine record. Cycles 2 and 3 together occupy the same time interval, recording successive positive δ18O shifts in the …

Dislocation models of the surface deformation adjacent to the Hayward fault measured with the global positioning system and interferometric synthetic aperture radar favor creep at ∼7 millimeters per year to the bottom of the seismogenic zone along a ∼20-kilometer-long northern fault segment. Microearthquakes with the same waveform repeatedly occur at 4- to 10-kilometer depths and indicate deep creep at 5 to 7 millimeters per year. The difference between current creep rates and the long-term slip rate of ∼10 millimeters per year can be reconciled in a mechanical model of a freely slipping northern Hayward fault adjacent to the locked 1868 earthquake rupture, which broke the southern 40 to 50 kilometers of the fault.

We looked for evidence of this heating in apatite fission-track age and track-length distributions of samples from adjacent to and within the San Gabriel fault zone in southern California. The fault is thought to be an abandoned major trace of the San Andreas fault system active from 13 to 4 Ma and has since been exhumed from depths of 2–5 km. At our sample locality, as much as 40 km of total slip is thought to have accumulated along a localized ultracataclasite layer just 1–8 cm thick. We see no evidence of a localized thermal anomaly in either fission-track ages or track lengths—even in samples within just 2 cm of the ultracataclasite. Because of the absence of any measurable impact on fission tracks, we have been able to use …

We document here a strike-slip fault system 2–3 km long. Clustered about the west end of the fault system are several dozen faults that parallel the three main fault zones in the system. We interpret this cluster of small faults as a barrier that inhibited growth of fault zones in the fault system. A two-dimensional mechanical analysis shows that a cluster of small faults flanking the tip of a large fault zone will tend to diffuse the stress concentration near the fault zone tip—an analogous effect in engineering is known as crack-tip shielding. Near-tip stress concentrations promote fault growth, and processes that decrease these stress concentrations inhibit fault growth. As faults lengthen and grow, they interact …

Comparison of EDM and GPS data sets implies that, except for small‐scale transients, the fault motion has been steady over the last 40 years. We add 42 new GPS velocities along the CSAF to constrain the regional strain distribution. Shear strain rates are less than 0.083 ± 0.010 μstrain/yr adjacent to the creeping SAF, with 1–4.5 mm/yr of contraction across the Coast Ranges. Dislocation modeling of the data gives a deep, long‐term slip rate of 31–35 mm/yr and a shallow (0–12 km) creep rate of 28 mm/yr along the central portion of the CSAF, consistent with surface creep measurements. The lower shallow slip rate may be due to the effect of partial locking along the CSAF or reflect reduced creep rates late in the earthquake cycle of the adjoining SAF rupture zones. 
d'Alessio Matthew|Frictional strength heterogeneity and surface heat flow: Implications for the strength of the creeping San Andreas fault|MA d'Alessio, CF Williams, R Bürgmann|2006/5/1|Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|111|B5||Wiley-Blackwell|[1] Heat flow measurements along much of the San Andreas fault (SAF) constrain the apparent coefficient of friction (μ app) of the fault to< 0.2, much lower than laboratory‐derived friction values for most geologic materials. However, heat flow data are sparse near the creeping section of the SAF, a frictional “asperity” where the fault slips almost exclusively by aseismic creep. We test the hypothesis that the creeping section has a substantially higher or lower μ app than adjacent sections of the SAF. We use numerical models to explore the effects of faults with spatially and temporally heterogeneous frictional strength on the spatial distribution of surface heat flow. Heat flow from finite length asperities is uniformly lower than predicted by assuming an infinitely long fault. Over geologic time, lateral offset from strike‐slip faulting produces heat flow patterns that are asymmetric across the fault and along strike. We explore a … 
d'Alessio Matthew|Development of strike-slip faults from dikes, Sequoia National Park, California|Matthew d'Alessio, Stephen J Martel|2005/1/1|Journal of Structural Geology|27|1|35-49|Pergamon|Faults several kilometers long near Pear Lake in Sequoia National Park, California nucleated on preexisting dikes weakened by closely-spaced échelon joints. These joints essentially parallel much more widely spaced regional joints. Fault nucleation by dike fracturing can explain how a nearly planar fault can grow to lengths of several kilometers or more. We suggest that opening mode fractures, including dikes, might serve more commonly as nuclei for faults than is generally appreciated. The longest fault in the study area, the Pear Lake fault, has a trace length of ∼7 km and a maximum measured lateral separation of 86–98 m. A sharp decrease in slip occurs near the center of the trace of the Pear Lake fault where another fault branches from it. Mechanical analyses demonstrate that a sharp decrease in slip is expected where a fault branches. All the faults near Pear Lake show non-elliptical slip distributions …

In order to evaluate the burial and exhumation history of the site and its relationship to the kinematics and mechanics of the SAF, we use 15 apatite fission-track (FT) and 5 (U-Th)/He analyses from pilot hole samples to document their thermal history. Sample ages decrease with depth: FT and (U-Th)/He ages range from∼ 60 and∼ 31 Ma, respectively, in the upper 800 m of the hole to∼ 3 and 1 Ma at the base of the hole (2.2 km depth, 93 C). Thermal modeling of the distribution of FT lengths indicates three events in the last 80 Ma: 1) cooling and exhumation of> 60 C that culminated at∼ 30 Ma; 2) reheating of∼ 50 C from∼ 30 to 8–4 Ma, probably as the result of basin subsidence and burial by 1–1.5 km of sediments; and 3) cooling of∼ 30 C and …

These urban thinkers have less experience in the natural world and are more comfortable in built environments. They may have subtle differences in cognitive and spatial skill development, interest level in the natural environment, comfort with field experiences, and possible fears of outdoor settings. Curriculum is more effective at reaching urban thinkers when it accounts for these differences. Since urban thinkers are more comfortable in the built environment, short excursions on campus or in the schoolyard can be a bridge between settings familiar to urban thinkers and geologic processes important for the study of geosciences. These mini–field experiences provide opportunities for students to ask questions about the world around them, especially if emphasis is placed on the physical …

New analysis tools must be developed that fully and formally integrate these techniques, allowing a single geologic interpretation of the rate and timing of exhumation and burial events consistent with all data. We integrate a thermal model of burial and exhumation,(U‐Th)/He age modeling, and fission track age and length modeling. We then use a genetic algorithm to efficiently explore possible time‐exhumation histories of a vertical sample profile (such as a borehole), simultaneously solving for exhumation and burial rates as well as changes in background heat flow. We formally combine all data in a rigorous statistical fashion. By parameterizing the model in terms of exhumation rather than time‐temperature paths (as traditionally done in fission track modeling), we …

Results from an online question-ranking tool|Matthew A d'Alessio|2014/8/19|Electronic Journal of Science Education|18|5|||Asking questions is one of the key external indicators of curiosity and a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. To understand the types of questions students ask in an introductory college science class for preservice elementary teachers, students used an online question-ranking tool (Google Moderator) as part of the daily routine. This study compiled 2,494 student questions from 128 students in four sections of the same course taught by the same instructor. After grouping questions into nine categories based on cognitive level, two independent regimes of questioning emerged–knowledge-rich and exploration-rich. When students had more specific knowledge about a topic, they asked a greater percentage of questions that demonstrate knowledge, fewer testable scientific questions, and fewer questions about course logistics. This knowledge-rich regime is more active in students with high quiz scores. Lower scoring students tended to be more active in an exploration-rich regime. They asked more scientifically testable questions that reflect a desire to explore cause-and-effect relationships. During an online question-ranking process, students decided which questions they would like to discuss in class by voting for their preferred questions. They submitted 13,301 student votes on the questions in this study. Despite differences in question-asking, students at all performance levels voted for similar questions in this voting process. Voting patterns revealed that students slightly preferred higher order questions that demonstrate knowledge. Questions that are both scientifically testable and demonstrate knowledge received, on average, the highest number of …

Based on our understanding of plate motions that cause earthquakes, we know where on Earth to find locations that will produce large earthquakes and can estimate the maximum energy release at each spot (and therefore magnitude). Earthquake engineers use this information to design buildings so that they can withstand the largest possible earthquake. In areas like California, we even have estimates the likelihood of an earthquake in the next few decades (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 2007) and even the next few days (Jordan & Jones, 2010). So we actually can predict many aspects of an earthquake, but not the exact moment that earthquake will occur. The Next Generation Science Standards push students to explore engineering solutions that mitigate natural hazards (eg, MS-ESS3-2; MS-ETS1-2; MS-ETS1-3). While earthquake prediction remains without a solution, an understanding of earthquakes and seismic waves has allowed scientists and engineers to develop early warning systems that can provide vital advance notice of strong shaking, albeit only seconds or minutes (Allen, 2011). We developed a series of classroom and web-based activities to teach basic earthquake processes and this advanced engineering solution.

d'Alessio Matthew|The Thermal and Mechanical Behavior of Faults|Matthew Adam d’Alessio|2004|University of California, Berkeley. Doctoral Thesis|||||In its simplest definition, a fault is a fracture separating two blocks of crust that slide past one another. With sliding comes friction. The combination of this simple picture with the mechanical properties of the fault and surrounding crustal blocks provides a strong base for exploring factors that control the behavior of faults. In one sense, faults live and die by their frictional properties. Friction determines how and when a fault slips, how faults interact with each other, and influences fault geometry. Frictional strength affects heat production, deformation, and stresses in the rocks around faults. If our goal is to determine when, where, and how much a fault will slip, we need to know what factors control that behavior. To first order, friction helps answer all these questions. The simplest earthquake prediction is that a fault will slip when tectonic stresses exceed the frictional strength of the “weakest patch” of fault. To produce a more specific description of earthquake behavior, we need to quantify the rate of stress accumulation, the frictional strength of faults, and other factors that may influence these quantities. In this dissertation, I focus on understanding the role of fault geometry, kinematics, and frictional properties in controlling the thermal and mechanical behavior of faults. Several of these properties and processes are interdependent, with complex feedbacks (Fig. 1. 1). Different chapters of this thesis explore different parts of this system. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the kinematic and mechanical aspects of fault behavior, while the last three chapters emphasize the inter-relationship between fault friction, fault slip, and frictional heat generation. In this chapter, I …

Site appointed for this intervention is the Romberg Tiburon Campus, in Tiburon, California, that, as a detached campus of the San Francisco State University, has as research field the study of San Francisco Bay’s marine and coastal ecosystems, on whose shores it lies. This competition requested the participants the conception of a visitor’s center complex for the diffusion among a wider public of this cove’s rich history, the peculiar ecosystem of the Bay’s estuary and the development of the researches here produced, in the view of an opening to the public of this Campus.

To produce higher precision estimates of stress drop on regional networks like the Parkfield HRSN borehole network, we use the multi-window spectral ratio (MWSR) method to determine the corner frequency and relative moment of earthquake pairs. This method assumes that the frequency distribution of spectral power is the same for direct arrivals and later arriving scattered energy. By taking the power spectra of individual time windows, we collect multiple, quasi-independent estimates of the power spectra for a given earthquake. For pairs of earthquakes located within a few hundred meters of one another, the ratio of their power spectra at a given station provides better estimates of their relative moments and corner frequencies by eliminating some of the path-dependent effects. We calculate …

You can! Student understanding takes leaps and bounds when given the opportunity to observe and discover geology in the field, but concerns over logistics and the availability of nearby outcrops limit many teachers from including a regular field component into their classes. Geologic field trips exist for urban areas, particularly focusing on stone facades of public buildings made of fine granite, limestone, or sandstone. I assert that a similar philosophy can be used to explore more humble urban surroundings like college campuses and elementary school playgrounds. I have developed a series of activities available on the web that are adaptable to elementary school through college classrooms. These activities illustrate how teachers can get their students outside the classroom and into the" field." Many geologic concepts have analogs in modern day construction techniques and materials. For example, multiple layers of pavement illustrate superposition; sewer line excavations demonstrate excellent cross-cutting relationships; and school blacktop surfaces frequently show" glacial" striations where brooms are used to distribute tar surfacing. Students might be more familiar with the processes that led to the construction of their urban landscape, which occurs on a timescale that they can easily grasp. Like geologic processes, urban construction leaves behind evidence of the processes that were at work. By teaching students to look for that evidence and illustrating the parallels between modern construction and natural geologic processes, teachers can integrate an exciting field aspect to almost any class …

d'Alessio Matthew|Slicing up the San Francisco Bay Area: Insights from regional block modeling of GPS data|MA D'Alessio, R Bürgmann|2005/5|AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts|||||Utilizing a new compilation of GPS velocities for the San Francisco Bay Area, we present a 3-D block model to solve for the slip rates of individual fault segments within the San Andreas fault system. Block models employ similar assumptions to traditional dislocation modeling (deep dislocations representing plate-boundary deformation, elastic medium), but add the additional physical constraint that individual faults must form connected boundaries around coherent blocks. Our slip rate estimates have important implications for regional seismic hazard, but here we use our model as a case study to focus on the advantages and limitations of this simple block modeling. We describe the importance of global constraints on estimating regional slip rates, the use of heat flow and seismicity to provide a first order constraint on the the seismic/aseismic transition depth, and the ability to test different scenarios of fault … 
d'Alessio Matthew|Frictional heterogeneity and heat flow|MA D'Alessio, R Bürgmann, CF Williams|2004/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The magnitude of frictionally generated heat varies as a function of the frictional strength of a fault. The heterogeneity of natural faults suggests that realistic models of frictional heat generation should consider variations in frictional strength. Here we use numerical models to explore the effects of faults with spatially and temporally heterogeneous frictional strength on the spatial distribution of surface heat flow. Lateral variations of friction along strike combined with the lateral displacement of the blocks by a strike-slip fault requires a non-linear solution to heat flow equations and can produce heat flow patterns that are asymmetric across the fault and along-strike. This asymmetry has implications for conclusions about fault strength drawn from existing heat flow measurements. We explore a range of slip rate-asperity size combinations to determine the limit in which a heterogeneous fault is indistinguishable from a fault …

The analysis focuses on the northern 60 km of the fault where surface creep rates appear to be constant over the past several decades. InSAR data from 24 independent ERS interferograms are stacked to obtain range-change rates from 1992 to 2000. Surface displacement rates at 43 sites are observed using GPS from 1994 to 2002.

The fault has a trace length of 7 km and is hosted in granitic rock. The fault developed from pre-existing aplite dikes and joints and, on average, strikes ENE with a near-vertical dip, consistent with the orientation of the dikes; small segments of the fault strike NE, consistent with the strike of regional joints. The lateral separation profile along the fault, determined primarily from offsets of steeply-dipping dikes, can be described as a perturbed elliptical distribution. This is one of the first slip profiles we know of for an intra-plate strike slip fault of its size in crystalline rock.

In a matter of a few seconds, hundreds of people were buried beneath the piles of rubble that were once their homes. While the cities have long since been rebuilt and the cracks filled, the impact of the earthquake of 1927 is greater--this is the only major earthquake in the Holy Land for which scientists have both scientific seismic measurements as well as non-scientific subjective accounts of the earthquake's impacts. Because of this distinction, this earthquake offers the only opportunity to compare and correlate the two types of measurements. With such a comparison, historic accounts of earthquakes can be interpreted better. 
d'Alessio Matthew|Heat, Friction, and the Mechanics of Faults|Matthew A d’Alessio, Roland Bürgmann|||||||During an earthquake, two blocks of the Earth’s crust slide past one another generating massive amounts of frictional heat. In fact, Kanamori & Brodsky (2001) describe earthquakes as thermal events more than seismic events because most of the energy release during an earthquake goes into heat rather than seismic waves. While seismologists continue to collect valuable data, Earthscope’s SAFOD and PBO projects provide a unique opportunity for us to expand our knowledge of the earthquake process by understanding heat produced along large faults. Most notably, frictional heat could hold the key to unlocking the three-decade-old mystery about the frictional strength of plate boundary faults. This enhanced understanding of the rheology of plate boundaries will lead to improvements in mechanical models of faulting, stress-triggering, and earthquake rupture. 
Evans Eileen|Geodetic imaging of coseismic slip and postseismic afterslip: Sparsity promoting methods applied to the great Tohoku earthquake|Eileen L Evans, Brendan J Meade|2012/6/1|Geophysical Research Letters|39|11|||[1] Geodetic observations of surface displacements during and following earthquakes such as the March 11, 2011 great Tohoku earthquake can be used to constrain the spatial extent of coseismic slip and postseismic afterslip, and characterize the spectrum of earthquake cycle behaviors. Slip models are often regularized by assuming that slip on the fault varies smoothly in space, which may result in the artificial smearing of fault slip beyond physical boundaries. Alternatively, it may be desirable to estimate a slip distribution that is spatially compact and varies sharply. Here we show that sparsity promoting state vector regularization methods can be used to recover slip distributions with sharp boundaries, representing an alternative end-member result to very smooth slip distributions. Using onshore GPS observations at 298 stations during and in the∼ 2 weeks following the Tohoku earthquake, we estimate a band of … 
Evans Eileen|Geodetic constraints on San Francisco Bay Area fault slip rates and potential seismogenic asperities on the partially creeping Hayward fault|Eileen L Evans, John P Loveless, Brendan J Meade|2012/3/1|Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|117|B3|||[1] The Hayward fault in the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) is sometimes considered unusual among continental faults for exhibiting significant aseismic creep during the interseismic phase of the seismic cycle while also generating sufficient elastic strain to produce major earthquakes. Imaging the spatial variation in interseismic fault creep on the Hayward fault is complicated because of the interseismic strain accumulation associated with nearby faults in the SFBA, where the relative motion between the Pacific plate and the Sierra block is partitioned across closely spaced subparallel faults. To estimate spatially variable creep on the Hayward fault, we interpret geodetic observations with a three-dimensional kinematically consistent block model of the SFBA fault system. Resolution tests reveal that creep rate variations with a length scale of< 15 km are poorly resolved below 7 km depth. In addition, creep at depth …

By comparing these measurements with model predictions, we find that this subsidence appears to be dominated by poroelastic contraction associated with ongoing geothermal fluid production, rather than the purely fault‐related subsidence proposed previously. Using a simple point source model, we suggest that the source of this proposed volumetric strain is at depths between 1.0 km and 2.4 km (95% confidence interval), comparable to generalized boundaries of the Salton Sea geothermal reservoir. We find that fault slip on two previously imaged tectonic structures, which are part of a larger system of faults in the Brawley Seismic Zone, is not an adequate predictor of …

The role of fault system geometry in describing ECSZ deformation may be investigated with total variation regularization, which algorithmically determines a best-fitting geometry from an initial model with numerous faults, constrained by a western United States GPS velocity field. The initial dense model (1) enables construction of the first geodetically constrained block model to include all ECSZ faults with geologic slip rates, allowing direct geologic-geodetic slip rate comparisons, and (2) permits fault system geometries with many active faults that are analogous to distributed interseismic deformation. Beginning with 58 ECSZ blocks, a model containing 10 ECSZ blocks is …

These measurements may be interpreted using block models, in which the upper crust is divided into microplates bounded by faults that accumulate strain in a first-order approximation of earthquake cycle processes. The number and geometry of microplates are typically defined with boundaries representing a limited subset of the large number of potentially seismogenic faults. An alternative approach is to include a large number of potentially active faults bounding a dense array of microplates, and then algorithmically estimate the boundaries at which strain is localized. This approach is possible through the application of a total variation regularization (TVR) optimization algorithm, which …

All three models are generally driven by a combination of loading on locked faults and (aseismic) fault creep. Here we construct viscoelastic block models and viscoelastic-cycle models for the Western US, focusing on the Pacific Northwest and the earthquake cycle on the Cascadia megathrust. In the viscoelastic block model, the western US is divided into blocks selected from an initial set of 137 microplates using the method of Total Variation Regularization, allowing potential trade-offs between faulting and … 
Evans Eileen|Linking faults: Subsurface creep on a contiguous fault structure connecting the Hayward and Calaveras faults|E Evans, R Burgmann, R Nadeau|2007/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The Hayward Fault is the most likely Bay Area fault to rupture in a major earthquake in the next 30 years. Much of the Hayward fault experiences 3-6 mm/yr of creep at the surface, approximately half of its estimated long-term slip rate (~ 9mm/yr). The southernmost section of the Hayward fault, however, appears to be creeping at up to 9 mm/yr, before creep abruptly ceases just south of Freemont, CA. East of Fremont, the Calaveras Fault transitions from about 15 mm/yr of slip along its creeping southern section, to about 6 mm/yr in the north. Based on location and slip, it seems very likely that the Calaveras fault directly transfers the deficit 9 mm/yr of slip as creep to the Hayward Fault. The existence of characteristic repeating earthquakes in this region strongly suggests that active creep indeed occurs between the two faults. Seismic studies of the Hayward-Calaveras stepover have suggested that the southern Hayward …

Evans Eileen|Sources of subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field|Andrew J Barbour, Eileen L Evans, Stephen H Hickman, Mariana Eneva|2016/2/22|41st Workshop on Geothermal Reservoir Engineering, Stanford University, Stanforf, California|14||15||At the Salton Sea Geothermal Field (SSGF) in Southern California, surface deformation associated with geologic processes including sediment compaction, tectonic strain, and fault slip may be augmented by energy production activities. Separating the relative contributions from natural and anthropogenic sources is especially important at the SSGF, which sits at the apex of a complex tectonic transition zone connecting the southern San Andreas Fault with the Imperial Fault; but this has been a challenging task so far. Here we analyze vertical surface velocities obtained from the persistent scatterer InSAR method and find that two of the largest subsidence anomalies can be represented by a set of volumetric strain nuclei at depths comparable to geothermal well completion zones. In contrast, the rates needed to achieve an adequate fit to the magnitudes of subsidence are almost an order of magnitude greater than rates reported for annual changes in aggregate net-production volume, suggesting that the physical mechanism responsible for subsidence at the SSGF is a complicated interplay between natural and anthropogenic sources.

Evans Eileen|A 20-year catalog comparing smooth and sharp estimates of slow slip events in Cascadia|EG Molitors Bergman, EL Evans, JP Loveless|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Slow slip events (SSEs) are a form of aseismic strain release at subduction zones resulting in a temporary reversal in interseismic upper plate motion over a period of weeks, frequently accompanied in time and space by seismic tremor at the Cascadia subduction zone. Locating SSEs spatially along the subduction zone interface is essential to understanding the relationship between SSEs, earthquakes, and tremor and assessing megathrust earthquake hazard. We apply an automated slope comparison-based detection algorithm to single continuously recording GPS stations to determine dates and surface displacement vectors of SSEs, then apply network-based filters to eliminate false detections. The main benefits of this algorithm are its ability to detect SSEs while they are occurring and track the spatial migration of each event.

Evans Eileen|Imaging Cascadia coupling: optimal design for an offshore seafloor geodetic network|Eileen L Evans, Sarah E Minson|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest of the United States is known to produce MW≈ 9.2 earthquakes, and accompanying tsunamis every 600 years. An outstanding question in this region (as in most offshore subduction zones) is the degree to which the megathrust is locked (ie, the coupling rate), and whether the locked zone extends to the trench, where onshore geodetic measurements cannot uniquely resolve strain accumulation. Seafloor geodetic techniques, such as acoustic ranging combined with GNSS positioning, are capable of providing unique observations of strain accumulation near the offshore trench of subduction zones. These observations may be used to constrain megathrust coupling rate and spatial distribution, and ultimately forecast the potential size and rupture pattern of a future subduction zone earthquake, with resolution beyond the capability of onshore observations alone … 
Evans Eileen|Persistent slip rate discrepancies in the eastern California (USA) shear zone: Reply|Eileen L Evans|2017/9/1|Geology|45|9|e426-e426|Geological Society of America|We thank John Platt for his interest (his Comment: Platt, 2017) in our paper (Evans et al., 2016) and for bringing our attention to Platt and Becker (2013), which explores the hypothesis that large-scale rotations may contribute to geologic-geodetic slip rate discrepancies on the Garlock fault, Southern California, USA. We agree with his Comment (also stated by Platt and Becker, 2013) that the Garlock fault appears to be nearly invisible to geodetic observations, which is surprising given that the Garlock fault (1) is a continuous morphological feature that is not obviously disrupted by through-going right-lateral eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) faults, and (2) appears have slipped 4–11 mm/yr during the late Holocene (eg, McGill et al., 2009). The degree to which wholesale clockwise rotation of the region contributes to the geologic-geodetic discrepancy seems to depend on the differing modeling assumptions in our two approaches. The conceptual model of Platt and Becker (2013) postulates clockwise rotation in a region around the Garlock fault that cancels sinistral shear due to buried slip on the Garlock. The degree to which dextral shear occurs in the Platt and Becker (2013) model is dependent on the applied sphericity correction of 26% of Pacific–North America relative plate motion and is sensitive to this particular choice. An advantage of our geodetic analysis using block modeling is that it explicitly accounts for the kinematics of intersecting fault sets. Block models divide the crust into microplates that are bounded by faults and estimate block rotations and elastic strain accumulation, constrained by geodetic observations. Fault slip rates are … 
Evans Eileen|Using Strain Rates to Forecast Seismic Hazards|Eileen Evans|2017/3/14|EOS|||||One essential component in forecasting seismic hazards is observing the gradual accumulation of tectonic strain accumulation along faults before this strain is suddenly released as earthquakes. Typically, seismic hazard models are based on geologic estimates of slip rates along faults and historical records of seismic activity, neither of which records actively accumulating strain. But this strain can be estimated by geodesy: the precise measurement of tiny position changes of Earth’s surface, obtained from GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), or a variety of other instruments. 
Evans Eileen|Statistical tests of simple earthquake cycle models|Phoebe MR DeVries, Eileen L Evans|2016/12/16|Geophysical Research Letters|43|23|||A central goal of observing and modeling the earthquake cycle is to forecast when a particular fault may generate an earthquake: a fault late in its earthquake cycle may be more likely to generate an earthquake than a fault early in its earthquake cycle. Models that can explain geodetic observations throughout the entire earthquake cycle may be required to gain a more complete understanding of relevant physics and phenomenology. Previous efforts to develop unified earthquake models for strike-slip faults have largely focused on explaining both preseismic and postseismic geodetic observations available across a few faults in California, Turkey, and Tibet. An alternative approach leverages the global distribution of geodetic and geologic slip rate estimates on strike-slip faults worldwide. Here we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for similarity of distributions to infer, in a statistically rigorous manner, viscoelastic … 
Evans Eileen|Geodetic slip rate estimates in California, and their uncertainties|EL Evans|2016/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Current understanding of the seismic potential of faults in California is limited in part by our ability to resolve spatial and temporal changes in fault slip rates across the Pacific-North American plate boundary, and quantify their uncertainties. Fault slip rate can be estimated by modeling fault systems, based on space geodetic measurements of surface ground displacement (GPS and InSAR). However, models that include elastic deformation due to locked faults require fault geometries to be prescribed, and geodetic slip rate estimates may vary widely due to measurement and epistemic (model) uncertainties. To examine published geodetic slip rate estimates in California and quantify variability among models, we compile 31 published geodetic slip rate studies in California and Nevada. Because deformation models may vary in the number of faults represented and the precise location of faults, we combine published …

In this study, we use ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to reveal interseismic crustal deformation in Taiwan. We combine InSAR and GPS measurements in 2006-2010 time period and from prior to the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake as interseismic crustal deformation, and use block models to interpret interseismic geodetic measurements.

Evans Eileen|Fault slip and distributed deformation in the eastern California shear zone|EL Evans, WR Thatcher, FF Pollitz, JR Murray|2015/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Understanding fault slip rates in the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) is complicated by possible near-fault or broadly distributed deformation. Furthermore, geodetically-constrained models that include elastic deformation due to locked faults require fault geometries to be prescribed, and incorrect fault parameterization may introduce off-fault deformation artifacts. We address the potential role of block model fault system geometry in describing ECSZ deformation with total variation regularization (TVR), an L1 regularization method that allows for an algorithmic assessment of the best-fitting geometry based on geodetic observations from a combined Western United States velocity field. Beginning with 62 ECSZ blocks, we reduce the number of active faults to identify a simpler block model geometry containing only 9 ECSZ blocks.

Evans Eileen|Quantizing the Complexity of the Western United States Fault System with Geodetically and Geologically Constrained Block Models|EL Evans, BJ Meade|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Geodetic observations of interseismic deformation provide constraints on miroplate rotations, earthquake cycle processes, slip partitioning, and the geometric complexity of the Pacific-North America plate boundary. Paleoseismological observations in the western United States provide a complimentary dataset of Quaternary fault slip rate estimates. These measurements may be integrated and interpreted using block models, in which the upper crust is divided into microplates bounded by mapped faults, with slip rates defined by the differential relative motions of adjacent microplates. The number and geometry of microplates are typically defined with boundaries representing a limited sub-set of the large number of potentially seismogenic faults. An alternative approach is to include large number of potentially active faults in a dense array of microplates, and then deterministically estimate the boundaries at which … 
Evans Eileen|Geodetic Imaging of Fault System Activity|Eileen Louise Evans|2014/6/6||||||Geodetic observations provide kinematic constraints on the behavior of tectonically active fault systems. Estimates of earthquake cycle activity derived from these constraints may depend on modeling assumptions and/or regularization of a geodetic inverse problem, which is often poorly conditioned. Common model assumptions may affect kinematic solutions and conclusions about physical properties of faults and fault zones. For example, within a geometrically complex fault system, parameterization of nearby faults may affect slip estimates on an individual fault. In addition, fault slip models are often regularized by assuming that slip varies smoothly in space, which may artificially smear slip estimates beyond physical boundaries. As an alternative to smooth regularization, the applied mathematics field of compressed sensing provides a suite of methods for recovering sparse solutions. Applied to GPS observations of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, compressed sensing algorithms enable imaging of spatially localized slip during and following the earthquake, and identification of a sharp boundary between coseismic and postseismic slip. Similar algorithms recover quantized solutions and may be applied to models of plate boundary deformation. Beginning with a dense array of tectonic micro-plates bounded by mapped faults in North America, these methods can be used to detect coherent motions of groups of micro-plates behaving as larger active blocks, effectively quantifying the complexity of North America plate boundary deformation. By improving our ability to identify and compare kinematic constraints on earthquake cycle processes, we are … 
Evans Eileen|Sparse imaging of postseismic afterslip following the Tohoku earthquake|EL Evans, BJ Meade|2013/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Geodetic observations following the 2011 M w 9.0 Tohoku earthquake record postseismic deformation and provide constraints on the spatial and temporal evolution of postseismic afterslip. Understanding the behavior of postseismic afterslip is essential for testing hypotheses related to Coulomb failure theory, characteristic rupture theory, and the existence of mechanical asperities. Traditional geodetic imaging methods rely on the assumption that slip varies smoothly, which limits resolution of slip boundaries that may bear on interpretation of the frictional properties of the fault. As an alternative, we apply a sparsity-promoting l 1 regularization algorithm (lasso) to estimate postseismic afterslip based on horizontal GPS displacements following the Tohoku earthquake. In addition to a classical near logarithmic increase in displacement with time we estimate faster slip rates north of the hypocenter near the region of the … 
Evans Eileen|Total variation denoising of interseismic deformation in western North America|EL Evans, BJ Meade|2012/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Geodetic observations of interseismic deformation provide constraints on microplate rotations, earthquake cycle processes, and slip partitioning across the Pacific-North America plate boundary. These measurements may be interpreted using block models, in which the upper crust is divided into microplates bounded by mapped faults. The number and geometry of microplates are typically defined with boundaries representing a limited sub-set of the large number of potentially seismogenic faults. An alternative approach is to include all possible faults in a dense array of microplates, and then deterministically estimate the boundaries at which strain is localized. This is possible with a regularization technique called total variation denoising (TVDN), which simultaneously minimizes of the l 2-norm of the data residuals and l 1-norm of the variation in the estimated state vector. Applied to three-dimensional spherical block … 
Evans Eileen|Sharpened images of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake from sparsity based methods|EL Evans, BJ Meade|2011/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Understanding the relationship between strain accumulation and release in subduction zones is limited by our ability to resolve and compare spatial patterns of coseismic slip and interseismic slip deficit. In earthquake geodesy, estimates of fault slip are traditionally determined by regularized least squares minimization. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that slip distributions vary smoothly, often resulting in artificially smearing fault slip beyond physical boundaries and in resolution tests with known slip distributions. As an alternative, we suggest that new insight may be gained by searching for spatially sharp estimates of coseismic fault slip and interseismic slip deficit, which can be obtained by the application of methods such as basis pursuit denoising that simultaneously minimize the L1 norm of the state vector as well as L2 norm of the data residual vector. These algorithms reduce the number of nonzero … 
Evans Eileen|Interseismic interactions in geometrically complex fault systems: Implications for San Francisco Bay Area fault creep and tectonics|EL Evans, BJ Meade, JP Loveless|2010/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Fault systems at active plate boundaries accommodate the differential motion of tectonic plates through slip on anastomosing faults within the seismogenic upper crust. The partitioning of slip across fault systems can be inferred from models of space-based geodetic measurements to estimate both fault slip rates and interseismic fault creep. Covariance between slip rate estimates on sub-parallel faults may be significant but can be reduced with the addition of the fundamental constraint that total slip across a fault system must sum to the differential plate motion rate. The importance of ensuring such kinematic consistency becomes increasingly important in strike-slip fault systems such as in the San Francisco Bay Area, where slip is localized across 4-8 sub-parallel faults with< 20 km spacing. We demonstrate that assumptions regarding the kinematic consistency of nearby faults can map onto on-fault creep estimates … 
Evans Eileen|Investigating fault coupling: Creep and microseismicity on the Hayward fault|EL Evans, JP Loveless, BJ Meade, R Burgmann|2009/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||We seek to quantify the relationship between interseismic slip activity and microseismicity along the Hayward fault in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area. During the interseismic regime the Hayward fault is known to exhibit variable degrees of locking both along strike and down-dip. Background microseismicity on and near the fault has been suggested to provide independent information about the rates of interseismic creep and the boundaries of creeping regions. In particular, repeating earthquakes within the fault zone have been suggested as a proxy for fault creep rates. To investigate this relationship, we invert GPS data for microplate rotations, fault slip rates, and fault coupling using a block model that spans western United States and includes the San Andreas, Hayward, Calaveras, Rogers Creek, and Green Valley faults in the greater Bay area. The tectonic context provided by the regional scale model … 
Evans Eileen|Subsurface Creep and Geometry of the Hayward-Calaveras Stepover|EL Evans, R Bürgmann, B Meade, N Houlie, R Nadeau, GJ Funning|2008/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The San Francisco Bay Area has not experienced a major earthquake beneath and urban center since 1906. The Hayward fault is the most populated fault in the area, and 140 years after its last rupture, also has the greatest risk associated with it. A contiguous subsurface stepover connecting the Hayward and the Calaveras faults appears to directly transfer slip between the two faults, and may affect earthquake rupture scenarios on both faults. Although the Hayward fault is partially locked for much of its trace, the southernmost fault creeps up to 9 mm/yr, equal to its long-term slip rate. At the proposed juncture region, the southern Calaveras fault also exhibits a surface creep rate close to total slip rate of 15mm/yr. Although, creep on the northern Calaveras is poorly constrained, its geologic slip rate is about 6 mm/yr, suggesting direct slip transfer from the southern Calaveras to the Hayward fault. Relocated seismicity …

To address this, we measured mercury concentrations and speciation in water impacted by the New Idria mine. Total unfiltered mercury concentrations (UHgT) in acid mine drainage (AMD) (5.2 to 41 ng/L) were comparable to concentrations upstream from the mine (4.2 to 13 ng/L). We measured substantially higher UHgT concentrations (2900 to 12 400 ng/L) in water 1.2 km downstream from the AMD input and estimate that the creek transports a baseline flux of 1.5 kg of Hg/yr from the mine site. We hypothesize that tailings are the primary source of mercury to this creek. We attribute the decrease in UHgT along a downstream transect to Hg(II) scavenging by iron oxyhydroxide particles that precipitate and settle out of the water. Likewise, dissolved gaseous mercury concentrations decreased …

Concentrations of HgT were relatively low, ranging from 1.2 to 28.3 pM in filtered groundwater, 0.8 to 11.6 pM in filtered surface waters, and 2.5 to 12.9 pM in unfiltered surface waters. Concentrations of MMHg ranged from <0.04 to 3.1 pM in filtered groundwater, <0.04 to 0.53 pM in filtered surface waters, and 0.07 to 1.2 pM in unfiltered surface waters. Multiple linear regression analysis identified significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between dissolved groundwater concentrations of HgT and those of NH4+ and SiO2, and between dissolved groundwater concentrations of …

We infer a groundwater-seawater mixing scenario based on salinity and temperature trends and suggest that increased groundwater discharge to the ocean during low tide transported mercury offshore. Unfiltered HgT (U-HgT) concentrations in groundwater (2.2–5.9 pM) and seawater (3.3–5.2 pM) decreased during a falling tide, with groundwater U-HgT concentrations typically lower than seawater concentrations.

Spatial gradients in those isotopic signatures evidence the conservative lateral transport of lead in oceanic water masses, while the discrete isotopic signatures in deep oceanic waters substantiate the complementary hypothesis that the release of lead from settling particles is relatively small on a decadal time-scale. Specifically, the relatively low radiogenic lead (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb=1.148±0.009) in the Lower-North Atlantic Deep Water (l-NADW) south of 10° North is primarily attributed to US industrial lead emitted in the Northern Hemisphere prior to 1965, and the more radiogenic lead (e.g., 206Pb/207Pb=1.180±0.006) in the Upper-North Atlantic Deep Water (u-NADW) is primarily attributed to …

We used daily sampling during the onset of the freshet in the Fraser River (southwestern Canada) in 2013 to identify rapid changes in the flux and composition of dissolved material, with a focus on dissolved organic matter (DOM). Previous time series sampling (at twice monthly frequency) of dissolved inorganic species in the Fraser River has revealed smooth seasonal transitions in concentrations of major ions and tracers of water and dissolved load sources between freshet and base flow periods. In contrast, daily sampling reveals a significant increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (200 to 550 μmol L−1) occurring over a matter of days, accompanied by a shift in DOM optical properties, indicating a transition towards higher molecular weight, more aromatic DOM composition. Comparable changes in DOM composition, but not concentration, occur at other times of year, underscoring the role of seasonal climatology in DOM cycling. A smaller data set of total and dissolved Hg concentrations also showed variability during the spring freshet period, although dissolved Hg dynamics appear to be driven by factors beyond DOM as characterized here. The time series records of DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations indicate that the Fraser River exports 0.25–0.35 % of its annual basin net primary productivity. The snowmelt-dominated hydrology, forested land cover, and minimal reservoir impoundment of the Fraser River may influence …

During a rising tide, unfiltered total mercury (U-HgT) concentrations in seawater increased from ∼6 to 20 pM at Black Point (west Bay) and from ∼2.5 to 8 pM at Niu (central Bay). We attribute this change to an increase in suspended particulate matter at high tide. Approximately 90% of mercury in groundwater at Niu was in the filtered (<0.45 μm) fraction, with a concentration of ∼4 pM. Groundwater discharge during a period of amplified SGD at Niu appeared to contribute to an increase in total mercury concentrations in filtered seawater (F-HgT; 1.2 to 2.4 pM) and in unfiltered seawater (U-HgT; 2.5 to 3.2 pM). The larger magnitude of change in F-HgT relative …

The potential for this top-down contamination is greatest in coastal areas with productive marine ecosystems that provide ideal habitats for large marine mammal colonies that can number in the thousands. This recycling of MeHg was evidenced by comparing total mercury (HgT) and MeHg concentrations in seawater, and HgT in molted pelage of M. angustirostris, at the Año Nuevo State Reserve pinniped rookery with concentrations at neighboring coastal sites in Central California. Seawater MeHg concentrations around the rookery (average = 2.5 pM) were markedly higher than those at the …

Algal mats common to the delta's sediment surface had MMHg concentrations ranging from 7.5 to 31.5 ng/g, and the top 1 cm of sediment directly under the mats had two times greater MMHg concentrations compared to adjacent locations without algal covering. Spatial trends in resident biota reflect enhanced MMHg uptake at the delta compared to other bay locations.

Ganguli Priya|Mercury Speciation in Acid Mine Drainage: New Idria Quicksilver Mine, California|Priya M Ganguli|1998/9||||||Recent studies demonstrate that mercury contamination in aquatic environments is a serious health threat to both human and aquatic life. This contamination originates from a multitude of sources, including atmospheric deposition, industrial discharge into water ways, and acid mine drainage (AMD) from abandoned gold and mercury mines. Due to the extensive gold and mercury deposits that have been mined throughout the western United States, there is growing interest in determining both the mass loading of mercury from abandoned mines, and the fate ofthat mercury downstream.

Sage Lot Pond is relatively undisturbed and has low nitrogen loading (12 kg ha-1 y-1). It is part of the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve and is surrounded by undeveloped wooded uplands. In contrast, Great Pond is highly impacted. Nitrogen loading to the site is elevated (600 kg ha-1 y-1) and the marsh is adjacent to a large residential area. In both systems, a 1 to 2 m organic-rich peat layer overlies the permeable sand aquifer. Groundwater in this region is typically oxic, where pore water within salt marsh peat is suboxic to anoxic.

Many West Coast streams transition from estuarine to lagoon conditions in the dry season when a sand berm develops at the stream mouth, restricting surface water exchange with the ocean. Because lagoons accumulate nutrients from their upstream watershed they are susceptible to eutrophication, which can promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria. In nearshore settings, these bacteria are primarily responsible for producing MMHg, a bioaccumulative neurotoxin. We found that MMHg concentrations in lagoon water (1-5 pM) were higher than in groundwater (0.2-1 pM) and coastal seawater (0.1-0.6 pM). Groundwater depth profiles combined with subsurface resistivity images suggest MMHg in …

This lagoon system provides protected habitat for more than 100 bird species and for populations of fish, mammals, and invertebrates. Total mercury (HgT) concentrations in water within Younger Lagoon appear to vary with rainfall conditions and range from about 5-15 pM. These concentrations are similar to HgT in water from six nearby lagoon systems. However, Younger Lagoon contains elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (~ 1 mM) and monomethylmercury (MMHg,~ 1 pM) relative to our comparison lagoon sites (DOC< 0.5 mM and MMHg< 0.5 pM). We attribute Younger Lagoon's high DOC and MMHg to its restricted connection to the ocean and minor riverine contribution. Coastal lagoons in this region typically form at the mouth of … 
Ganguli Priya|Seasonal Variability in Mercury Speciation within Select Coastal Lagoons of Central California|PM Ganguli, CH Conaway, NT Dimova, PW Swarzenski, NC Kehrlein, AR Flegal|2011/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Coastal lagoons may play an important role in mercury biogeochemical cycling at the land-sea margin. Along the coast of California, these systems are seasonally dynamic, behaving as estuaries during the wet season and as lagoons in the dry season when ephemeral sand berms develop and isolate terrestrial freshwater from direct exchange with the ocean. As a consequence, many lagoons become eutrophic in the dry season and are characterized by high nutrient and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. Because monomethylmercury (MMHg) production can be mediated by anaerobic bacteria, coastal lagoons are a potential source of biologically available MMHg that may be transported to the nearshore environment via submarine groundwater discharge. To evaluate the importance of coastal lagoons at the land-sea margin, we quantified total mercury (HgT) and MMHg concentrations in surface water and …

The Bay is downstream of 40 percent of the land area of California. Its watershed receives 80 percent of the rainfall in the State, because it rains more in the north. Three billion kilograms of sediments are annually flushed from the Central Valley watershed and deposited in San Francisco Bay. Because mercury preferentially binds to sediments, we calculate mercury loads to the Bay by considering how various sources affect mercury concentrations in Bay sediments. During and after the Gold Rush, over seventy thousand tons of mercury was produced in Coast Range cinnabar mines. Much of this mercury was used as quicksilver to extract gold from placer formations in the Sierra foothills, and later in the production of munitions, electronics, health care and commercial products.

Ganguli Priya|Assessing Remediation Efforts at the former New Idria Mercury Mine, California|Rachel Hohn, Priya M Ganguli, Scott Hauswirth, Kimberly Newton, Danielle Bram|||||||Mercury (Hg), which is mined from cinnabar (HgS), is an economic resource used extensively in California to extract gold and silver. Because Hg binds to carbon, fossil fuel combustion is a significant source of Hg globally. Although Hg is no longer mined in the US, abandoned mines continue to impact watersheds throughout California. In fact, the two largest Hg producers in North America were located in the California Coast Range Mountains: the New Almaden Mine near San Jose and the New Idria Mine,~ 170 km SE of San Jose. Both are Superfund Sites, with extensive remediation completed at New Almaden. Cleanup at New Idria has been more challenging, due in part to its remote location. Our study is designed to evaluate water and sediment quality downstream from New Idria following initial remediation activities, which were completed in 2015. The cinnabar deposit at New Idria is located within a …

Tar–aqueous interfacial tensions (IFTs) and contact angles were measured, and column flushing experiments were conducted. NaOH solutions (0.01–1 wt.%) were found to significantly reduce tar–aqueous IFT. Contact angles indicated a shift to strongly water-wet, then to tar–wet conditions as NaOH concentration increased. Column experiments were conducted with flushing solutions containing 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5% NaOH, both with and without xanthan gum (XG). Between 10 and 44% of the residual tar was removed by solutions containing only NaOH, while solutions containing both NaOH and XG removed 81–93% of the tar with final tar saturations as low as 0.018. The mechanism responsible for the tar removal is likely a combination of reduced IFT, a …

Cosolvents have been shown to dramatically increase the solubility of such compounds compared to the aqueous solubility; however, limited data are available on the effectiveness of cosolvents for field-contaminated media. In this work, we examine cosolvent flushing for the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil from a former manufactured gas plant (FMGP). Batch studies confirmed that the relationship between the soil–cosolvent partitioning coefficient (Ki) and the volume fraction of cosolvent (fc) followed a standard log-linear equation. Using methanol at an fc of 0.95, column studies were conducted at varying length scales, ranging from 11.9 to 110 cm. Removal of PAH compounds was determined as a function of pore volumes (PVs) of cosolvent flushed. Despite …

This experimental study investigates the relationship between composition and tar–water interfacial tension (IFT), a property of primary importance in determining the transport of tar in porous media. Nine field-collected FMGP tars and a commercially available coal tar were characterized by means of fractionation, gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, and vapor pressure osmometry. The tar-aqueous IFT of the tars, as well as resins and asphaltenes extracted therefrom, were measured over a range of pH. The IFTs were found to be strongly dependent on pH, with the lowest values obtained at high pH. The reduction of IFT at high pH was found to correlate well with the ICO values from the FTIR analysis, which provide an indication of the relative … 
Hauswirth Scott|Chemical Impacts Associated with Southern California Wildfires|Scott Hauswirth, Priya M Ganguli, Luis Devera, Daniel Otto, Sina Sadeghi, Massis Agop, Christopher C Cerda, EC Rodman|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Wildfires are a persistent threat in Southern California, and their frequency and severity has increased in recent years. Incomplete combustion of organic material produces potentially large quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of chemical compounds linked to cancer and harmful ecosystem effects. Despite the potential impacts, the transport and persistence of wildfire-derived PAHs in aquatic environments has received little study. This work represents a preliminary study to assess the magnitude and persistence of these compounds in soils, sediments, and waters in wildfire-impacted watersheds in the greater Los Angeles region. Samples were analyzed for a suite of parent and alkylated PAHs, heterocyclic compounds, and alkanes. Established molecular ratio methods were used to distinguish between pyrogenic sources and petrogenic sources (either anthropogenic or natural). Soil … 
Hauswirth Scott|Assessment of Oxidant-Polymer Compatibility for Enhanced In Situ Chemical Oxidation|Christopher C Cerda, EC Rodman, Sina Sadeghi, Daniel Otto, Massis Agop, Ian Espinoza, Scott Hauswirth|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Contamination of groundwater is a significant problem that can significantly reduce the usability of groundwater resources. Many groundwater contaminants are amenable to degradation by in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO), however, contaminants have the potential to migrate into low permeability zones where remediation becomes difficult. Polymer solutions containing xanthan gum and guar gum can aid in remediation processes due to their fluid properties. Their higher viscosity relative to the resident groundwater allows for increased penetration into low permeability zones, potentially improving delivery of oxidants. In this study, we measure the kinetic oxidation rates of various polymers in conjunction with particle stabilizers to assess oxidant-polymer compatibility. We characterize the shear-dependent rheological properties of polymers as a function of time, additives, and oxidant used with the goal of identifying … 
Hauswirth Scott|Physically based model for extracting dual permeability parameters using non-Newtonian fluids|Christelle Basset, Majdi Abou Najm, Ryan Stewart, Scott Hauswirth, George Saad|2018/4||20||10309||The complexity of pore structure in soils, fractured rocks, or porous media in general poses a major challenge to classic flow and transport methods. Dual permeability models evolved as effective tools capable of accounting for macro and micro structures. For that, different methods were developed to describe hydraulic characteristics of soils with two dominant structures. However, those models require additional parameters that should ideally be determined through affordable, simple, and non-destructive procedures. We utilize water and a non-Newtonian fluid in saturated flow experiments to develop a dual-permeability model that physically predicts the micro and macro structures of porous dual-structured soils. The objective of the study is to test the ability of these two fluids to accurately derive two physically-based average radii representing the bimodal pore size distributions in dual-domain soils. We developed … 
Hauswirth Scott|Characterization of Non-Newtonian Fluids for Environmental Applications|Ian Espinoza, Scott Hauswirth, Christopher C Cerda, Sina Sadeghi|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Non-Newtonian fluids are fluids that exhibit viscosity changes with time, stress, or changing shear rates. This distinctive quality is advantageous to a number of applications, such as hydraulic fracturing and contaminant remediation. The use of non-Newtonian fluids in contaminant remediation has recently increased as a method of improving delivery of chemical oxidants and surfactants in hard-to-reach, low permeability zones within the subsurface. As the application of these fluids continues to increase, a need to improve upon the basic understanding of non-Newtonian fluid rheology becomes increasingly important. This study investigates the characteristics of guar gum and xanthan gum, two common non-Newtonian polymers, and how factors such as composition, preparation method, and chemical and biological degradation impact the rheology of the fluids. Because the polymers are semi-hydrophobic … 
Hauswirth Scott|Enhanced In Situ Chemical Oxidation Using Surfactants and Shear Thinning Fluids|Scott Hauswirth, Sina Sadeghi, Christopher C Cerda, Ian Espinoza, Pamela B Schultz, Cass T Miller|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is an attractive approach for the remediation of recalcitrant contaminants, due to the fact that target compounds are degraded in place, precluding the need for ex situ treatment or disposal. However, field applications of ISCO approaches have been plagued by" rebound" of contaminant concentrations in groundwater weeks to months after treatment. The cause of rebound at a given site may vary, but is typically associated with back-diffusion from finer grained, low permeability units or the presence of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) that are incompletely degraded during treatment. Modifications to traditional ISCO methods have been proposed to overcome these challenges, including the use of shear-thinning polymers to improve delivery of oxidants to low permeability units and the addition of surfactants to improve dissolution of contaminants from NAPLs. In this work, we …

Development of accurate macroscale models of such systems requires an understanding of the relationship between the fluid and medium properties at the microscale and averaged macroscale properties. This study focuses specifically on guar gum, a major component of hydraulic fracturing fluids that exhibits Cross-model rheology. A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) incorporating non-Newtonian behavior was developed and validated against a semi-analytical solution for Cross-model fluid flow between parallel plates. The developed LBM was then used to simulate a series of one-dimensional column flow experiments conducted with a range of fluids and porous medium materials …

TCAT models are consistent across length scales and provide explicit linkages between important physics known to be operative at the microscale and larger scale models. This produces a straightforward mechanism to evaluate macroscale quantities based on information generated from microscale simulations or experiments as way to inform model development. TCAT models inherently include interface, common curve, and common point properties in models that admit such entities. Elements of the TCAT theory are discussed, model hierarchies are derived and summarized, and specific aspects of TCAT models are examined in detail. Comparisons of TCAT model constructs with …

Hauswirth Scott|Physicochemical Approaches for the Remediation of Former Manufactured Gas Plant Tars|S Hauswirth, CT Miller|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Former manufactured gas plant (FMGP) tars are one of the most challenging non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants to remediate due to their complex chemical composition, high viscosities, and ability to alter wettability. In this work, we investigate several in situ remediation techniques for the removal of tar from porous media. Batch and column experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of mobilization, solubilization, and chemical oxidation remediation approaches. Alkaline (NaOH), surfactant (Triton X-100), and polymer (xanthan gum) agents were used in various combinations to reduce tar-water interfacial tension, increase flushing solution viscosity, and increase the solubilities of tar components. Base-activated sodium persulfate was used alone and in combination with surfactant to chemically oxidized tar components. The effectiveness of each method was assessed in terms of both removal … 
Hauswirth Scott|Physicochemical approaches for the remediation of manufactured gas plant tar in porous media|Scott C Hauswirth|2014||||||Tars produced as a by-product of coal and oil gasification at former manufactured gas plants (FMGPs) during the 19 th and early 20 th centuries were often released into the environment through poor disposal practices or leaks in holding tanks and piping. These tars are persistent contaminants, leaching polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into groundwater and posing a significant risk to human and ecological health. FMGP tars also have several properties that make them notoriously difficult to remediate. They are dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), so they can migrate to depths which make removal by excavation difficult or impossible, and their relatively high viscosities and ability to alter the wetting characteristics of porous media result in inefficient removal by traditional pump-and-treat methods. This work investigates the relationship between tar composition and properties, and explores several … 
Hauswirth Scott|Chemical Oxidation of Complex PAH Mixtures by Base-activated Sodium Persulfate|Scott C Hauswirth, Cass T Miller|2013/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Former manufactured gas plant (MGP) tars pose significant environmental hazards and present a challenge to regulators and industry professionals. The tars, which were produced as a byproduct of the gas manufacturing process, were frequently released into the environment through improper disposal or leaks in plant infrastructure. The tars are complex mixtures containing thousands of individual compounds, including mono-and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs and PAHs), heterocyclic compounds, phenolics, and oxygenated compounds, with a wide range of concentrations, molecular masses, and aqueous solubilities. In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is an attractive approach for the remediation of recalcitrant soil and groundwater contaminants. One oxidant that has received significant recent attention is sodium persulfate (PS), which has several advantages, including a relatively long lifetime in porous media, the ability to destroy a wide-range of chemical contaminants, and a high oxidation potential. In this study, we investigate the oxidation of PAHs by baseactivated persulfate, and assessed the applicability of persulfate to the remediation of porous media contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) PAH mixtures. Experiments include batch and column studies with individual PAHs, a synthetic NAPL, and an MGP tar. The use of surfactants to increase NAPL-water mass transfer during oxidation was also investigated.

The interfacial tension (IFT) is a primary factor controlling the mobility of tars in porous media, and is therefore important to understand for both predicting the migration of tars and designing remediation strategies. In this study, we measured the IFT of field-collected FMGP tars and a commercially available coal tar for a pH range of 3-11. Additionally, the tars were characterized by means of chemical extractions (asphaltenes, resins, acids, and bases), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in order to allow correlation Additionally, the IFT and contact angle of each tar was determined

These dense non-aqueous phase liquids are largely composed of polycyclic aromatic compounds, including several known carcinogens. In some cases, horizontal creeping flow of subsurface tars has been observed. To improve predictions of tar migration, a rheological analysis was conducted to characterize their flow behavior. The analysis was conducted using samples obtained from six groundwater wells at two FMGPs. Viscosity was measured using standard capillary viscometers, where shear rate cannot be controlled; and using a rotational viscometer, where a range of shear rates was considered. Flow data from the rotational viscometer were fit to standard models and revealed non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior. Viscosity measurements from the capillary viscometers generally …

Remediation of coal tar is a significant environmental challenge due to its complex chemical composition, existence as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), and tendency to alter the wettability of porous media systems.

Previous studies have linked wetting changes to asphaltenes; however, our results suggest that wettability is not directly correlated to asphaltene concentration. Samples 3 and 4 exhibited the greatest tendency to alter wetting conditions but contained the lowest concentrations of asphaltenes. Additionally, tar from which asphaltenes and resins were removed showed a similar response to pH variation during contact angle measurements as did the complete tar samples.

Approximately 75% of the gabbros accreted within error of the predicted seafloor magnetic age, whereas ∼25% are significantly older. These anomalously old samples suggest either spatially varying stochastic intrusion at the ridge axis or, more likely, crystallization of older gabbros at depths of ∼5 to 18 kilometers below the base of crust in the cold, axial lithosphere, which were uplifted and intruded by shallow-level magmas during the creation of Atlantis Bank.

Miranda Elena|Strain localization along the Atlantis Bank oceanic detachment fault system, Southwest Indian Ridge|Elena A Miranda, Barbara E John|2010/4/1|Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|11|4|||Microstructural observations and mineral thermometry from in situ samples collected from the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex (SW Indian Ridge) indicate that detachment faulting was initiated under hypersolidus conditions in the ductile regime and continued through subgreenschist temperatures through the ductile, semibrittle, and brittle regimes as strain localized along the exposed, now subhorizontal fault surface. Ductile, semibrittle, and brittle fabrics are developed within dominantly gabbroic rocks. Footwall rocks exhibit crystal plastic fabrics distributed over a structural thickness up to 400 m below the denuded fault surface exposed at the seafloor, whereas semibrittle and brittle fabrics are concentrated in the 80 and 30 m immediately below the principal slip surface of the detachment fault, respectively.

Both models emphasize a footwall cored by gabbroic intrusions, therefore precluding an amagmatic origin of core complex formation. We test these models by using relict oceanic core complexes preserved in the western Mirdita Ophiolite in Albania. The Puka and Krabbi massifs display traits of the peridotite-localized detachment model, whereby amagmatic tectonic extension is not required for the formation of this category of core complexes. 
Miranda Elena|Microstructural evidence for the transition from dislocation creep to dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding in naturally deformed plagioclase|Elena A Miranda, Greg Hirth, Barbara E John|2016/11/1|Journal of Structural Geology|92||30-45|Pergamon|We use quantitative microstructural analysis including misorientation analysis based on electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data to investigate deformation mechanisms of naturally deformed plagioclase in an amphibolite gabbro mylonite. The sample is from lower oceanic crust exposed near the Southwest Indian Ridge, and it has a high ratio of recrystallized matrix grains to porphyroclasts. Microstructures preserved in porphyroclasts suggest that early deformation was achieved principally by dislocation creep with subgrain rotation recrystallization; recrystallized grain (average diameter ∼8 μm) microstructures indicate that subsequent grain boundary sliding (GBS) was active in the continued deformation of the recrystallized matrix. The recrystallized matrix shows four-grain junctions, randomized misorientation axes, and a shift towards higher angles for neighbor-pair misorientations, all indicative of GBS. The … 
Miranda Elena|Structural development of the Atlantis Bank oceanic detachment fault system, Southwest Indian Ridge|Elena A Miranda|2006||||||Oceanic detachment fault systems are commonly observed along slow-and ultra-slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges and are thought to develop in response to the tectonic component of mid-ocean ridge spreading, yet the processes of fabric development and strain localization associated with the detachment fault system are poorly understood. The Atlantis Bank detachment fault system formed between∼ 10-13 Ma along the ultra-slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge. We examine gabbroic rocks of the footwall and detachment fault surface to describe the structural evolution of the detachment fault system. We use petrographic, microstructural, electron microprobe, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses of in situ manned submersible samples to interpret the processes of fabric development and strain localization. This work is important as the processes of strain localization associated with oceanic …

Miranda Elena|The interplay and effects of deformation and crystallized melt on the rheology of the lower continental crust, Fiordland, New Zealand|Elena A Miranda, Keith A Klepeis|2016/12/1|Journal of Structural Geology|93||91-105|Pergamon|Microstructural, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and misorientation analyses of a migmatitic granulite-facies orthogneiss from the exhumed lower crust of a Cretaceous continental arc in Fiordland, New Zealand show how deformation was accommodated during and after episodes of melt infiltration and high-grade metamorphism. Microstructures in garnet, omphacite, plagioclase, and K-feldspar suggest that an early stage of deformation was achieved by dislocation creep of omphacite and plagioclase, with subsequent deformation becoming partitioned into plagioclase. Continued deformation after melt infiltration resulted in strain localization in the leucosome of the migmatite, where a change of plagioclase deformation mechanism promoted the onset of grain boundary sliding, most likely accommodated by diffusion creep, in fine recrystallized plagioclase grains. Our results suggest three distinctive … 
Miranda Elena|Structural development of an oceanic detachment fault system, Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge|Elena A Miranda, Barbara E John, Greg Hirth, Henry Dick|2002/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||In slow-spreading environments, both magmatic and tectonic processes accommodate spreading, where the latter can be manifested in the form of an extensional detachment fault system. The detachment fault system of Atlantis Bank, an oceanic core complex formed at the intersection of the Southwest Indian Ridge and the Atlantis II transform, is dissected by transform-parallel normal faults that provide unique cross-sections through all levels of the detachment fault system. Gabbros and peridotite collected in ODP Hole 735B and with the manned submersible Shinkai 6500 were located structurally beneath, within, and above the main detachment fault surface along the exposed length of the detachment fault system that correspond to roughly 2 Ma of crustal accretion.

Miranda Elena|The Rheological Evolution of Brittle‐Ductile Transition Rocks During the Earthquake Cycle: Evidence for a Ductile Precursor to Pseudotachylyte in an Extensional Fault System …|Craig A Stewart, Elena A Miranda|2017/12/1|Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|122|12|||We investigate how the rheological evolution of shear zone rocks from beneath the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) is affected by coeval ductile shear and pseudotachylyte development associated with seismicity during the earthquake cycle. We focus our study on footwall rocks of the South Mountains core complex, and we use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analyses to examine how strain is localized in granodiorite mylonites both prior to and during pseudotachylyte development beneath the BDT. In mylonites that are host to pseudotachylytes, deformation is partitioned into quartz, where quartz exhibits crystallographic-preferred orientation patterns and microstructures indicative of dynamic recrystallization during dislocation creep. Grain size reduction during dynamic recrystallization led to the onset of grain boundary sliding (GBS) accommodated by fluid-assisted grain size-sensitive (GSS) creep, localizing … 
Miranda Elena|Timing of mid-crustal deformation with respect to magmatism and detachment faulting in the South Mountains metamorphic core complex, Arizona, USA|Angela J Linder, Brian Lee CLEMENTS, Joshua J Schwartz, Elena A Miranda, Matthew COBBLE|2014/10/19|2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia|||||The South Mountains metamorphic core complex (SMCC) contains a record of Cenozoic extension and gravitational collapse that is fundamental to the post-orogenic crustal evolution of western North America. The SMCC comprises two variably deformed and mutually intrusive Miocene plutons, termed the South Mountains granodiorite (SMg) and the Telegraph Pass granite (TPg), both of which are intruded by syn-to post-kinematic felsic to mafic dike swarms. Extensional fabrics in the footwall are defined by crystal-plastically deformed quartz and brittlely fractured feldspars. The SMCC is unique because fabric development in the Tertiary footwall rocks cannot be attributed to older (eg, Cretaceous) deformation, thus presenting an opportunity to precisely determine timescales of mid-crustal deformation and mylonitic fabric development related to Miocene core complex faulting. Two samples were collected from the SMg, and one from the TPg. One SMg sample (SMg 1) was collected from the center of the core complex, whereas the second sample (SMg 2) was collected~ 1 km west of the first sample, away from any observed or mapped mafic dikes. The TPg sample was collected at the boundary between the SMg and TPg units, and is the least deformed footwall pluton sampled. The three samples yielded statistically indistinguishable 207 Pb c-corrected 206 Pb/238 U zircon SHRIMP-RG ages of 20.6±0.3 Ma (SMg 1), 20.8±0.2 Ma (SMg 2) and 20.1±0.5 Ma (TPg). Ti-in-zircon thermometry gave emplacement temperatures of 720±25 C and 710±25 C for SMg 1 and SMg 2, and 740±25 C for the TPg sample. Integrating our new data with a previous …

Miranda Elena|Rheological inheritance: lessons from the Death Valley region, US Basin and Range Province|Rodrigo D Lima, Nicholas W Hayman, Elena Miranda|2018/5/21|Geological Society, London, Special Publications|470||SP470. 14|Geological Society of London|Rheological inheritance occurs when older metamorphic and deformational fabrics impact the mechanics of younger tectonic provinces, such as occurs in extensional provinces developed on sites of previous orogenesis. The Funeral and Black Mountains from the Death Valley region of the US Basin and Range provide the opportunity to study such rheological inheritance. The Funeral Mountains expose shear zones containing high-grade metamorphic fabrics and evidence for synkinematic, decompression-driven melt of Late Cretaceous, orogenic origin. Quartz <c>- and [a]-axes patterns from the shear zones correlate with high-temperature slip systems. The quartz microstructures were formed via grain-boundary migration, and these are overprinted by high-strain layers of mixed-phase aggregates that underwent grain boundary sliding. Reaction textures from the Funeral Mountains illustrate that much of the fabric … 
Miranda Elena|Temporal and Spatial Variations in Magmatism and Transpressional Deformation in the Middle to Lower-Crust of a Cretaceous Arc, Median Batholith, Fiordland, New Zealand|Luisa F Buritica, Joshua J Schwartz, Keith Klepeis, Elena A Miranda, Mary Ringwood, Andrew J Tulloch, Matthew A Coble|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||We present forty-six new LASS-ICP-MS and SHRIMP-RG zircon and titanite dates and temperatures in order to document the spatial and temporal correlation of lithospheric-scale transpressional shear zones within the context of an arc flare-up event in the Fiordland sector of the Median Batholith, New Zealand. The thermochronologic data were collected from the lower-crustal Indecision Creek Shear zone (ICSZ), located in northern Fiordland, and the mid-crustal Grebe Mylonite zone (GMZ), located in central Fiordland. New Pb/U zircon dates document the timing of Separation Point Suite magmatism in central Fiordland. We find that Separation Point Suite plutonism initiated with emplacement of the Refrigerator Orthogneiss at~ 129 Ma and was followed by emplacement of the Takahe granodiorite at 125-123 Ma, the Puteketeke pluton at~ 122 Ma and the West Arm Leucogranite from 122-110 Ma. Sub-solidus deformation in the Refrigerator Orthogneiss is bracketed by post-kinematic dikes between~ 129 and~ 122 Ma, but is absent in younger plutons. Titanite thermochronology reveals that localized, amphibolite-facies mylonitic deformation in the GMZ in Lake Manapouri is hosted in Carboniferous rocks and is dated at~ 121 to~ 117 Ma. Coeval deformation during the 125-117 Ma interval is recorded in a number of diffuse shear zones in Jurassic and Carboniferous plutons located 30 km to the north in South Fiord, Lake Te Anau. In the lower crustal ICSZ, titanite dates in high-and-low-strain domains record upperamphibolite-facies transpression at 119-110 Ma. Our data document a series of temporally related high-grade transpressional shear … 
Miranda Elena|OXYGEN ISOTOPE MAPPING REVEALS A CRUSTAL-SCALE STRUCTURE WITHIN THE MEDIAN BATHOLITH, FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|S Andico, Joshua J Schwartz, Andy Tulloch, Rose Turnbull, Keith Klepeis, Elena A Miranda, Kouki Kitajima, MF Ringwood|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||The Median Batholith in New Zealand is a complex, Cordilleran-type batholith that formed along the southeast Gondwana margin from the late Paleozoic to late Mesozoic. Previous studies have proposed that the Median Batholith intruded a fundamental temporal and lithologic discontinuity between allochthonous, primarily oceanic-affinity rocks to the east (Eastern Province) and primarily Gondwana-affinity rocks to the west (Western Province). However, the crustal architecture of this boundary is obscured by voluminous intrusions of Mesozoic Darran and Separation Point Suite plutons. Here, we use zircon oxygen isotope SIMS data from lower and middle crustal plutons to provide new insights into the crustal-scale structure within the Median Batholith and its significance as a boundary between the Eastern and Western Provinces. We present over 500 δ O (zircon) isotope analyses from 66 samples distributed across~ 9,000 km of Fiordland. Isotope data reveals three isotopic domains separated by 0.7 to 1.0‰ discontinuities. The western isotopic domain includes lower crustal Western Fiordland Orthogneiss rocks and has mantle-like δ O values ranging from+ 5.3 to+ 6.1‰. The eastern isotopic domain includes mid-crustal Darran and Separation Point Suite plutons, and is characterized by lower δ O values ranging from+ 3.7 to+ 4.5‰. The central isotopic domain includes plutons from mid-crustal Darran and Separation Point Suite and lower-crustal Arthur River Complex and Western Fiordland Orthogneiss. This domain is characterized by transitional isotopic values that display a strong EW gradient with δ O values rising from+ 4.5 in the east to+ 5 …

Mafic Gravel Associated with Miocene Obduction and Subduction Initiation in New Zealand|Kathleen M Marsaglia, Carrie Bender, Jessica Dillon, Colin Mazengarb, Michael Marden, E Miranda|2008/10/5|2008 Joint Meeting of The Geological Society of America, Soil Science Society of America, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies with the Gulf Coast Section of SEPM|||||The East Cape of North Island, New Zealand is an actively deforming forearc overprinted by a south-verging obduction event that upthrust Miocene to Cretaceous sedimentary units over the forearc basin. The thrust-based Allochthon contains deeper water facies equivalents of underlying sedimentary units, as well as an ophiolitic section of Cretaceous age and equivocal origin (Matakaoa) exposed at its northernmost extreme. The ophiolite is thought to have been emplaced during a complex reorientation of the subduction zone from east-west to north-south in the Miocene. Near the frontal thrust of the Allochthon within the Waipaoa River drainage basin there are a few outcrops of an unusual mafic conglomerate (Ihungia). These outcrops lie~ 70 km distant from the ophiolite outcrops to the north. Pebble counts show the composition to be roughly 60% mafic volcanic rocks, 30% intermediate/mafic plutonic/hypabyssal rocks, and% 10 sedimentary rocks. Some of the igneous rocks are foliated and exhibit shear-sense indicators. Associated sandstones show volcanic, plutonic and amphibolite clasts in addition to detrital serpentine. No bioclasts were noted. Gravel clast shapes are dominantly equant with lesser rods/rollers/discs. Gravel clast shapes and lithologies are consistent with the Ihungia being fluvial gravels derived from the emerging allochthon and perhaps deposited in an associated foredeep. 
Miranda Elena|Grain Boundary Sliding (GBS) as a Plastic Instability Leading to Coeval Pseudotachylyte Development in Mylonites: an EBSD Study of the Seismic Cycle in Brittle-Ductile …|Elena Miranda, Craig Stewart|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Exposures of coeval pseudotachylytes and mylonites are relatively rare, but are crucial for understanding the seismic cycle in the vicinity of the brittle-ductile transition (BDT). We use both field observations and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis to investigate the coeval pseudotachylytes and granodiorite mylonites exposed in the footwall of the South Mountains core complex, Arizona, to evaluate how strain is localized both prior to and during pseudotachylyte development at the BDT. In the field, we observe numerous pseudotachylyte veins oriented parallel to mylonitic foliation; the veins have synthetic shear sense with adjacent mylonites, and are< 2 cm thick, laterally discontinuous, and confined to a few m in structural thickness. EBSD analysis reveals that deformation is strongly partitioned into quartz in mylonites, where quartz shows subgrain rotation overprinted by bulging recrystallization … 
Miranda Elena|MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A DISTRIBUTED MID-CRUSTAL SHEAR ZONE: A NORTHERN EXTENSION OF THE GREBE MYLONITE ZONE IN FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND?|Courtney McGinn, Elena A Miranda, Lonnie Hufford, Joshua J Schwartz, Keith A Klepeis|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||We use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to evaluate strain localization processes within strands of a distributed shear zone to evaluate whether it represents the along-strike extension of the Grebe Mylonite Zone (GMZ), previously interpreted to represent a zone of shortening in the middle crust of Fiordland, New Zealand. High-strain zones within the distributed shear zone crop out along the northern coast of South Fiord in Lake Te Anau, and the exposures lie several km along strike to the north of the GMZ, but it is unknown if the zones are coeval and record the same deformation conditions. We present EBSD results from two samples collected from the high-strain zones: a granodiorite mylonite (17NZ42), and a diorite mylonite (17NZ58) that represent the compositional heterogeneity of the shear zone. Field observations of the distributed shear zone reveal trends in orientation and shear sense. Mylonitic foliations primarily strike SW and dip moderately to steeply NW. We observed predominantly sinistral shear sense indicators within the mylonites, correlating with a component of top-to-the-west, normal-sense of movement in high strain zones of the distributed sinistral shear zone. The mylonitic foliation orientations are similar to those we measure in the GMZ (strike SW, dip steeply NW), and the sense of motion is consistent with our interpretation of kinematic indicators in the GMZ.

The Grebe Mylonite Zone (GMZ) in central Fiordland, New Zealand, is a mid-crustal shear zone developed within Carboniferous-age granite, tonalite, and diorite host rocks, and its association with voluminous, mid-crustal Separation Point Suite (SPS) plutons suggests a fundamental link between arc magmatism and shear zone deformation. We present data from two representative GMZ samples here: 17NZ95C1 (biotite diorite mylonite), and 17NZ96 (granite mylonite). In both samples, quartz and plagioclase show contrasting amounts of crystal plasticity and LPO development. In 17NZ95C1, elongate plagioclase and biotite define the foliation, and the quartz is interstitial in nature; quartz displays some Dauphine twins and has slightly rounded to straight grain boundaries, and plagioclase exhibits some deformation twinning and rare lobate grain boundaries. In 17NZ95C1, plagioclase exhibits moderate LPO consistent with the {001}< 100> slip system, and quartz has no LPO. In 17NZ96, quartz has Dauphine twins and has some irregular grain boundaries where pinned. Plagioclase porphyroclasts have some deformation twins, lack subgrain development, and are surrounded by elongate recrystallized grains without host control orientation relationships, suggesting limited crystal plasticity. In 17NZ96, plagioclase has a weak LPO that is inconsistent with the kinematic reference frame, and quartz has a moderate LPO indicating basal< a> slip. 
Miranda Elena|PLAGIOCLASE DEFORMATION RESULTING IN LOCALIZED STRAIN IN A LOWER CRUSTAL SHEAR ZONE, FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|Caroline E Gross, Elena A Miranda, Keith Klepeis|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||We perform microstructural and EBSD analysis on naturally-deformed plagioclase to identify strain localization processes in a lower crustal shear zone that formed at the root of a Mesozoic continental arc system exposed in Fiordland New Zealand. Three samples correspond to different depths and different strain intensities. Sample 068C is a granulite from a low-strain zone within the Resolution Orthogneiss and represents the deepest level (≥ 50 km). Samples 0210D and 0212D are from a retrogressed (amphibolite facies) part of the Pembroke granulite at structurally higher levels (~ 40 km) and correspond to high and low strain zones, respectively. Our microstructural observations show distinct differences in plagioclase microstructural development for the low-and high-strain shear zone samples. The plagioclase in the low-strain sample of the Pembroke Granulite (0212D) exhibits annealed textures, but relict grains of medium-coarse grain size show undulose extinction, minor subgrain development, and deformation twinning. The high strain Pembroke sample (0210D) has slightly elongate relict grains with deformation twinning, small recrystallized grain sizes (< 10 µm), and core-and-mantle structure consistent with subgrain rotation (SGR) recrystallization. Sample 068C contains a range of grain sizes where many grains have straight to lobate-shaped grain boundaries consistent with grain boundary migration (GBM) recrystallization. 
Miranda Elena|Microstructural Evolution of an Extensional Shear Zone: the Transition from Dislocation Creep to Grain Boundary Sliding in Naturally Deformed Plagioclase|E Miranda, G Hirth, BE John|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||We present microstructural, LPO, and misorientation data from EBSD analyses to interpret the deformation mechanisms of naturally deformed plagioclase in an amphibolite-facies extensional shear zone within oceanic crust. Textural data and mineral chemistry data for thermometry were acquired on samples of gabbro mylonite collected from the footwall of the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex; we focus on a monophase plagioclase layer with a high ratio of recrystallized matrix grains to porphyroclasts. Sample microstructures are subdivided into three regions: seven porphyroclasts, recrystallized grains immediately adjacent to those porphyroclasts, and the population of recrystallized matrix grains. All porphyroclasts exhibit subgrain development and show clustering of low-angle (3-10º) misorientation axes within the {010} plane, consistent with slip on {010}. However, only one porphyroclast is oriented for …

Miranda Elena|Strain localization in granodiorite mylonites: a microstructural and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) study of the South Mountains core complex, Arizona|RM Greenberg, E Miranda|2009/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The quantification of strain localization in detachment fault shear zones is essential to the study of continental core complex development and permits insight into continental crust rheology during extension. We present a microstructural and EBSD study of naturally deformed shear zone rocks from the footwall of the South Mountains, Arizona, core complex to interpret the deformation mechanisms that lead to strain localization along the detachment fault. The footwall of the South Mountains core complex is dominated by a Miocene composite pluton that exhibits Miocene extensional mylonitic fabrics associated with the structural development of the core complex. The composite pluton is composed of granodiorite, granite, and quartzolite, but the granodiorite is the most voluminous of the intrusive units. The detachment fault shear zone is developed within the granodiorite and quartzolite intrusive units. We conducted a … 
Miranda Elena|Core Complexes Are Tectonic Windows of Opportunity: A Microstructural Evaluation of Shear Zone Rheology and Strain Localization in the South Mountains Core Complex, Arizona|Elena A Miranda, James S Carter|2008/10/5|2008 Joint Meeting of The Geological Society of America, Soil Science Society of America, American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Gulf Coast Association of Geological Societies with the Gulf Coast Section of SEPM|||||Core complexes are a known manifestation of regional or local tectonic extension, but the strain localization processes associated with the development of a discrete detachment fault surface remain controversial. We investigate the process of strain localization within a mylonitic shear zone associated with core complex development in the South Mountains, central Arizona, in order to evaluate the rheology of crustal rocks during tectonic extension. The footwall rocks of the South Mountains core complex are dominated by a large composite middle Tertiary (22-25 Ma) granitoid pluton that is synkinematic with respect to the ductile mylonitic deformation associated with middle Tertiary core complex development, and are therefore ideal for this study. Our preliminary microstructural observations from South Mountains Granodiorite mylonites suggest that strain is preferentially localized within quartz, and that quartz deforms under dislocation creep. Quartz is extensively dynamically recrystallized, forming quartz ribbons with high aspect ratios. We observe dynamically recrystallized quartz showing both Regime 2 and Regime 3 microstructures indicative of subgrain rotation and grain boundary migration recrystallization, respectively. In contrast, plagioclase and K-feldspar form porphyroclasts that are commonly brittlely fractured. The plastic behavior of quartz and the brittle behavior of the feldspar porphyroclasts together suggests that these mylonites developed at temperatures above the threshold for quartz plasticity (~ 300 蚓), but not above the threshold for feldspar plasticity, interpreted to be around~ 500 蚓. Our results suggest that the rheology of the … 
Miranda Elena|Microstructural Evaluation of Strain Localization Along the South Mountains Detachment Fault System, Arizona, USA|JS Carter, EA Miranda|2007/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Detachment faulting is widely recognized as a mechanism of extension in the Basin and Range province, but the strain localization processes thought to contribute to the development of a discrete detachment fault surface are variable within the province. Though some detachment faulting has been attributed to deformation purely within the brittle regime, other fault systems, such as the South Mountains core complex in Arizona, are associated with fabric development within both the ductile and brittle regimes. In the South Mountains, Middle Tertiary (25-22 Ma) magmatism was accompanied by detachment faulting, which resulted in the development of mylonitic and cataclastic fabrics in intrusive rocks of the footwall. We examine granodioritic fault rocks from the detachment fault footwall and fault surface to identify specific deformation mechanisms that promoted strain localization along the South Mountains …

The exposed fault rocks provide details of the extensional fault system a distance of~ 39 km normal to the ridge axis; core from ODP Hole 735B reveals variation of the fault system with structural depth. We use microstructures and thermometry to describe the structural evolution of the footwall during high-temperature ductile to low-temperature brittle deformation.

Miranda Elena|Growth and Construction of Oceanic Crust at Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge|JJ Schwartz, BE John, MJ Cheadle, EA Miranda, CB Grimes, JL Wooden, HJ Dick|2005/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Magmatic zircon is a common accessory mineral in oceanic crustal rocks including gabbro, oxide gabbro, diabase and felsic veins. Its presence in these rocks provides an exceptional opportunity to document crustal growth processes at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. We present nineteen Pb/U zircon SHRIMP-RG ion probe ages of lower crustal rocks collected by manned submersible, ROV, dredging and ODP drilling from a 20 x 30 km2 area of Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge, which allow us to constrain the growth and construction of oceanic crust. Weighted average 206Pb/238U ages of these samples range from 10.7 to 13.9 Ma, with errors of 0.1-0.6 my (< 1-4%). At least 75% of these gabbros accreted within error of the predicted sea-surface magnetic age, whereas up to 25% are between 700,000 and 2.5 my older. In one sample, we identified zircon with inherited cores as much as 1.5 my older than … 
Miranda Elena|Strain localization within the ductile and brittle regimes: the development of the Atlantis Bank oceanic detachment fault system, Southwest Indian Ridge|Elena A Miranda, Greg Hirth, Barbara E John|2005/10/16|2005 Salt Lake City Annual Meeting|||||The mechanics of low-angle detachment fault formation remains controversial as some geologic field evidence for their formation is at odds with conventional Andersonian faulting theory. One key to understanding detachment faulting is the quantification of processes that allow strain localization within both the brittle and ductile regimes. We examine gabbroic fault rocks of the Atlantis Bank oceanic detachment fault system, a~ 900 km 2 oceanic core complex formed along the ultra-slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge between~ 13-10 Ma. We interpret the process of strain localization to determine how grain size, strain rate, and deformation mechanisms are related in order to describe the initiation and evolution of the low-angle normal detachment fault system of Atlantis Bank. We use the flow law creep parameters for synthetic aggregates of both plagioclase and amphibole in order to construct deformation mechanism maps given the grain size, temperature and LPO signature of each sample. We use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to measure the presence or absence of a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) in plagioclase and amphibole. Results suggest that high-T plagioclase deformation is accomplished by dislocation creep in the {010}< 100> slip system; at low-T, grain size reduction through grain boundary migration recrystallization results in diffusion creep deformation. The amphibole fabric is dominated by the {100}< 001> slip system, which develops in pressure solution. We use microprobe-determined mineral compositions for thermometry and for use in the flow laws. Microtextures indicate that high-T fabric is overprinted by … 
Miranda Elena|OCEANIC CORE COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT AT ATLANTIS BANK, SOUTHWEST INDIAN RIDGE|Elena A MIRANDA|2004/11/7|2004 Denver Annual Meeting|||||In slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge environments, spreading is accommodated by both magmatic and tectonic processes, where the latter may be manifested in the form of an extensional low-angle detachment fault system. Due to the multiple manifestations of spreading, slow-spreading ridges have unique features that include ‘inside-corner highs’, anomalous bathymetric highs intimately linked to the tectonic partitioning of spreading. Atlantis Bank, a paleo-inside-corner high representing 4.6 my of crustal accretion, is a topographically anomalous, faulted feature formed initially at the intersection of the ultra-slow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) and the Atlantis II Transform. It is part of a long-lived (2.1 my) detachment fault system associated with an oceanic core complex (~ 900 km 2 in area) originally developed within oceanic lithosphere at the inside-corner high of the SWIR-Atlantis II Transform ridge-transform intersection. The Atlantis Bank core complex exposes gabbro, oxide gabbro and rare serpentinized peridotite. It exhibits a dome-shaped corrugated detachment surface that has been subsequently cut by moderately-dipping transform-parallel normal faults, enabling Shinkai 6500 manned submersible sampling of the footwall, hanging wall, and detachment fault surface, providing details of the extensional fault system exposed over 39 km normal to the ridge axis.

Schwartz Joshua|Trace element chemistry of zircons from oceanic crust: A method for distinguishing detrital zircon provenance|Craig B Grimes, Barbara E John, PB Kelemen, FK Mazdab, JL Wooden, Michael J Cheadle, K Hanghøj, JJ Schwartz|2007/7/1|Geology|35|7|643-646|Geological Society of America|We present newly acquired trace element compositions for more than 300 zircon grains in 36 gabbros formed at the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic and Southwest Indian Ridges. Rare earth element patterns for zircon from modern oceanic crust completely overlap with those for zircon crystallized in continental granitoids. However, plots of U versus Yb and U/Yb versus Hf or Y discriminate zircons crystallized in oceanic crust from continental zircon, and provide a relatively robust method for distinguishing zircons from these environments. Approximately 80% of the modern ocean crust zircons are distinct from the field defined by more than 1700 continental zircons from Archean and Phanerozoic samples. These discrimination diagrams provide a new tool for fingerprinting ocean crust zircons derived from reservoirs like that of modern mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) in both modern and ancient detrital zircon …

The geochemistry of 267 zircon grains was measured by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe-reverse geometry at the USGS-Stanford Ion Microprobe facility. Three types of zircon are recognized based on texture and geochemistry. Most ocean crustal zircons resemble young magmatic zircon from other crustal settings, occurring as pristine, colorless euhedral (Type 1) or subhedral to anhedral (Type 2) grains. In these grains, Hf and most trace elements vary systematically with Ti, typically becoming enriched with falling Ti-in-zircon temperature. Ti-in-zircon temperatures range from 1,040 to 660°C (corrected for a TiO2 ≈ 0.7, a … 
Schwartz Joshua|Provenance of a late Proterozoic–early Cambrian basin, Sierras de Córdoba, Argentina|Joshua J Schwartz, L Peter Gromet|2004/2/12|Precambrian Research|129|1-2|1-21|Elsevier|Detrital zircons in metasedimentary rocks of Cambrian or older age in the Sierras de Córdoba provide information on sources of continental detritus on the western paleo-margin of Gondwana. Analysis of single zircon grains indicates dominant populations of Neoproterozoic (∼ 600–700 Ma) and Mesoproterozoic (950–1050 Ma) age, and a limited presence of Paleoproterozoic (∼ 1900 Ma) zircon. Additional constraints on provenance are provided by the Pb isotopic compositions of peraluminous granites derived from the metasedimentary section. These compositions fall within the distinctive 207 Pb-rich Gondwana provinces and therefore appear to rule out a Laurentian source such as the Argentine Precordillera. We interpret the sources of the Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic zircons to be Gondwanan, most likely derived from the cratonic regions of South America and/or the once contiguous cratons of …

The relationship between the two belts and their relative timing are constrained through new U-Pb zircon ages on granodiorites, monzogranites, and associated volcanic rocks from Sierra Norte and the easternmost Sierras de Córdoba. These ages indicate that calc-alkaline arc magmatism was active over at least a 30-m.yr. period from 555 to 525 Ma, terminating at the same time that peraluminous magmatism and associated high-grade metamorphism began in the adjoining metasedimentary belt (525–515 Ma). These temporal relationships and the metamorphic characteristics of the two belts appear to be in conflict with previously proposed models for the Pampean Orogeny as a continental-collision event, but …

Approximately 75% of the gabbros accreted within error of the predicted seafloor magnetic age, whereas ∼25% are significantly older. These anomalously old samples suggest either spatially varying stochastic intrusion at the ridge axis or, more likely, crystallization of older gabbros at depths of ∼5 to 18 kilometers below the base of crust in the cold, axial lithosphere, which were uplifted and intruded by shallow-level magmas during the creation of Atlantis Bank.

Detailed studies both north and south of the Blue Mountains Province (e.g., terranes of the Intermontane belt, Klamath Mountains, and western Sierra Nevada) have documented a complex Middle to Late Jurassic orogenic evolution. However, the timing of magmatic, metamorphic, and deformational events in the Blue Mountains, and the significance of these events in relationship to other terranes in the western North American Cordillera remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the structural, magmatic, and metamorphic histories of brittle to semibrittle deformation zones that indicate widespread Late Jurassic orogenesis in the Blue Mountains Province.

By ca. 123 Ma, a dense root, composed partly of garnet pyroxenite and omphacite granulite, had formed. At 118–115 Ma, during regional contraction, a magma flare-up thermally and mechanically rejuvenated the base of the arc, resulting in widespread crustal melting, granulite-facies metamorphism, and the circulation of hot partially molten lower crust. By ca. 114 Ma, the flow formed two different styles of migmatitic gneiss domes. At the deepest (∼65 km) levels, the Breaksea domes record the upward flow of material in diapirs balanced by a sinking garnet pyroxenite root. At shallower (∼40 km) levels, the Malaspina domes record lateral …

Whole-rock geochemistry and zircon trace element, U-Pb, Lu-Hf, and O isotopic data reveal that batholith construction occurred over ∼15 Ma, commencing with the syncollisional emplacement of small, low-Sr/Y (<40) norite-granite plutons from 157 to 155 Ma.

Day 1 is focused on sedimentary rocks of the Izee terrane. These deposits are divided into two unconformity-bounded megasequences, MS-1 and MS-2, that record two stages of syntectonic basin formation. MS-1 (Late Triassic to Early Jurassic) accumulated in fault-bounded marine sub-basins on the ﬂank of an inferred growing Baker terrane thrust belt. MS-1 sandstones, derived from the Baker terrane, contain abundant Paleozoic, Late Paleoproterozoic, and Late Archean detrital-zircon grains. These observations suggest afﬁnity of the Baker terrane and MS-1 in the Izee area to portions of the Klamath and Sierra Nevada terranes that contain similar detrital-zircon age distributions. MS-2 (Early to early-Late Jurassic) accumulated in a large marine basin that received input from low-grade metavolcanic rocks to the east (modern coordinates). Detrital zircons are dominated by Mesozoic, Neoproterozoic, and Mesoproterozoic grains. Two possible interpretations for MS-2 are:(1) the Jurassic Izee basin was fed directly by the large Mesozoic trans-cratonal sediment-dispersal system, or (2) transcratonal sediment was deposited in a Triassic backarc basin in Nevada and was later recycled into the Jurassic Izee basin during Cordilleran orogenesis.

Two major mylonite zones, the Goodwater-Enitachopco and Alexander City fault zones, have retrograded peak amphibolite facies fabrics and assemblages in rocks of the ancient Laurentian margin. Both faults are within a zone of transition between Carboniferous (Alleghanian) west-directed thrusts in the foreland and synchronous strike-parallel dextral shear zones in the hinterland. The 40Ar/39Ar hornblende and muscovite dates record late Mississippian cooling and exhumation from the Late Devonian (Neoacadian orogeny, 380–340 Ma) peak.

Hornblende gabbro intruded the PB, but occurs as xenoliths in the other plutons. Small bodies of cordierite trondhjemite represent the last stage of Wallowa magmatism. New Pb/U (SHRIMP-RG) ages show that the Wallowa batholith was constructed over~ 17 Ma. Zircons yielded the following concordant Pb/U ages: 140.2±1.4 Ma for PB, 130.8±1.5 Ma for NP, 130.2±1.0 Ma for HD, and 125.6±0.6 Ma for CM. A hornblende gabbro from the PB yielded an age of 132.9±0.6 Ma, whereas one of the trondhjemite bodies at Blue Lake (BL) gave an age of 122.9±1.7 Ma. Rocks from the PB, HD, and NP plutons are compositionally extended from diorite to granodiorite, have Sr/Y values generally< 40, and La/Yb< 12. Their compositions are consistent with derivation from a mantle source during the waning stages of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous arc activity associated with amalgamation of the Blue Mountains composite terrane province. In contrast, non-cumulate rocks from the CM are felsic (> 70 wt.% SiO 2), have Sr/Y values up to~ 64, and La/Yb of 17-19. Similarly, rocks from the BL trondhjemite have elevated Sr/Y and La/Yb (79-138 and~ 22, respectively). CM and BL compositions are consistent with partial melting of deep crustal rocks of variable composition. Their ages (~ 126-123 Ma) suggest they formed by melting of thickened crust following accretion of the Blue Mountains amalgamated …

Schwartz Joshua|Isotopic characteristics of the Baker terrane, NE Oregon: Implications for the relationship between the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes|Joshua J SCHWARTZ|2006/10/25|2006 Philadelphia Annual Meeting|||||The Baker terrane of northeastern Oregon consists of two distinctive subterranes, the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes (Ferns and Brooks, 1995). These distinct lithotectonic units preserve important depositional and deformational features that provide clues to the geodynamic evolution of the Baker terrane. The Bourne subterrane consists of dismembered Permian–Early Jurassic Elkhorn Ridge Argillite with tectonically intercalated slabs of meta-igneous rocks. The Elkhorn Ridge Argillite is a mélange that includes widespread chert-argillite broken formation with scattered metalimestone olistoliths. Both Tethyan and McCloud Permian fauna have been reported. In contrast, the Greenhorn subterrane is chiefly characterized by serpentinite-matrix mélange containing large blocks of metaplutonic, metavolcanic, metavolcaniclastic, and chert-argillite breccia. Associated with the Greenhorn subterrane are Permian–Triassic conglomerate, sandstone, argillite, and limestone of the Badger Creek unit. Fusulinids in the Greenhorn subterrane are of McCloud affinity and are distinctive from similar-aged fusulinids in the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite in the Bourne subterrane. Ferns and Brooks (1995) interpreted the characteristic features of the Bourne subterrane as representing an accretionary prism developed marginal to the Wallowa arc, whereas the Greenhorn terrane is interpreted as the dismembered fore-arc of the pericratonic Olds Ferry arc. We present new Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotopic data that indicate that both the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite and Badger Creek unit of the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes, respectively are characterized by strongly evolved …

Although the Cordillera is linear for most parts, terrane boundaries are at a high angle to the overall structural grain in several segments of the orogen, which has been a matter of longstanding controversy as to how and when these orogenic curvatures formed. This paper discusses mechanisms, kinematics, and timing of initiation of one of these major curvatures, the Blue Mountains Province in northeastern Oregon.

Schwartz Joshua|U-Pb zircon geochronology of Neoacadian and Early Alleghenian plutonic rocks in the Alabama Eastern Blue Ridge, Southern Appalachian Mountains|Joshua J Schwartz, Kenneth Johnson, S Ingram|2011/3/20|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|43|1|62||The Alabama Eastern Blue Ridge (EBR) of the Southern Appalachian Mountains hosts a variety of felsic plutonic rocks, which intrude multiply deformed Neoproterozoic to Ordovician (?) metasedimentary rocks. These plutons are commonly thought to have been emplaced during major Southern Appalachian tectonomagmatic events (Taconic, Neoacadian, and Alleghanian orogenies); however, few of the plutons have been dated by modern geochronologic techniques. Consequently, timescales of magmatism and associated deformation in this sector of the Southern Appalachian orogen are poorly understood. Here, we report new whole rock geochemistry and U-Pb zircon SHRIMP-RG ages for 6 Neoacadian to Early Alleghenian plutons. These data allow us to investigate timescales of plutonism, geochemical changes through time, and possible relationships between magmatism, metamorphism and Neoacadian ductile crustal flow. We find that Early Neoacadian plutonism included the emplacement of biotite-muscovite granites and granodiorites which include the Rockford Granite (376.6+/-2.8 Ma) and the Bluff Springs Granite (363.8+/-3.6 Ma). These plutons are in general strongly deformed, contain ubiquitous inherited zircon cores, and display geochemical characteristics consistent with shallow-pressure partial melting of pre-existing continental crust. By contrast, Early Alleghenian plutons are deformed to undeformed, and consist of low-K tonalites and trondhjemites (Almond trondhjemites and Blakes Ferry pluton) with geochemical characteristics suggestive of deep-crustal partial melting of a garnet-+ amphibole-bearing source. Two samples … 
Schwartz Joshua|Detrital zircon geochronology of Permian-Triassic metasedimentary rocks in the Baker terrane, Blue Mountains Province, NE Oregon|R Alexander, JJ Schwartz|2009/10/18|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|41|7|||Devonian-Early Jurassic metasedimentary rocks in the Baker terrane (northeastern Oregon) preserve important information regarding the depositional history and paleotectonic setting of the Baker terrane. The Baker terrane consists of two distinct subterranes (the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes). The dominant lithologic unit in the Bourne subterrane is the Devonian–Early Jurassic Elkhorn Ridge Argillite which includes widespread chert-argillite broken formation. The Greenhorn subterrane is chiefly characterized by serpentinite-matrix mélange containing large blocks of metaplutonic, metavolcanic, metavolcaniclastic, and chert-argillite breccia, all of which are overlain by Permian–Triassic conglomerate, sandstone, argillite, and limestone of the Badger Creek unit. Previous workers have interpreted the Bourne and Greenhorn subterranes to represent an accretionary prism and dismembered fore-arc, respectively. We present detrital zircon ages from eight sandstones and pebble conglomerates from both the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite (n= 3) and the Badger Creek unit (n= 5). In the Bourne subterrane, detrital zircon ages from the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite include~ 1% Mesozoic (multi-grain modal age peak at 244 Ma),~ 84% Paleozoic (255, 256, 271, 272, 278, 299, 304, 310, 318, 334, 345, 370, 384, 386, 402, 418Ma), and~ 15% Precambrian (1186, 1361, 1498, 1679, 1834, 1897, 1919, 1989, 2074, 2710 Ma). In the Greenhorn subterrane, ages from the Badger Creek unit are~ 9% Mesozoic (242, 251 Ma),~ 4% Paleozoic (328, 335, 368, 387Ma), and~ 87% Precambrian (1452, 1630, 1657, 1786, 1820, 1850, 1857, 1872, 1889, 1917, 1921, 1992, 1998 …

Schwartz Joshua|Magma emplacement process zone preserved in the roof of a large Cordilleran batholith, Wallowa Mountains, northeastern Oregon|Jiří Žák, Kryštof Verner, Kenneth Johnson, Joshua J Schwartz|2012/5/15|Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|227||61-75|Elsevier|The crestal portion of the upper-crustal Wallowa batholith, northeastern Oregon, provides an exceptional three-dimensional section through a flat batholith roof which rolls over into a steep wall at elevations of about 1600–2800 m. The roof–batholith margin is interpreted as representing the ‛frozen-in’ process zone of granodiorite magma which was arrested during its ascent, thus providing a direct view into processes that operate during construction of large, shallow-level Cordilleran-type batholiths. The batholith host rock records two principal and presumably coeval emplacement processes: ductile flow largely accommodated by rheologically weak and thus severely deformed marbles in the steep wall, and voluminous stoping of rheologically stronger, bedded siliciclastic rocks along the flat roof. Structures preserved along the roof suggest that the stoping was a multi-stage process involving emplacement of up to … 
Schwartz Joshua|Origin of paired Late Jurassic high and low Sr/Y magmatic belts in the Blue Mountains Province, NE Oregon|Joshua J SCHWARTZ|2009/10/18|2009 Portland GSA Annual Meeting|||||High and low Sr/Y plutons occupy large areas in ancient and modern orogenic belts, yet considerable controversy exists regarding mechanisms of their generation, the tectonic settings in which they form, and their role in the evolution of continental crust through time. In the Blue Mountains province (northeastern Oregon), Late Jurassic plutons and batholiths define two coeval yet geochemically and spatially distinct high and low Sr/Y belts that intrude pre-existing island arc crust. These belts trend NE-SW and occur within the Wallowa island arc terrane and Bourne subterrane of the Baker terrane (low Sr/Y belt), and the Greenhorn subterrane of the Baker terrane (high Sr/Y belt), respectively. The low Sr/Y belt (148-141 Ma) consists of predominantly tonalite and granodiorite (±diorite, gabbro), and has flat to slightly LREE-enriched patterns (La/Lu≤ 60), low Sr (< 400 ppm), and low Sr/Y values (< 40). The compositions of these plutons are consistent with derivation from a mantle source and/or shallow-level (< 30 km) melting of pre-existing island arc crust. In contrast, the high Sr/Y belt (147-145 Ma) is more compositionally restricted, consisting of tonalite and granodiorite, and displays steeply fractionated REE patterns (La/Lu> 120), a lack of Eu anomalies, elevated Sr concentrations (> 600 ppm) and high Sr/Y values (> 40). The composition of these plutons is consistent with partial melting of pre-existing island arc crust in the presence of a plagioclase-poor to absent, hornblende+ garnet-bearing source (depths> 30 km). Notably, the occurrence of the Late Jurassic high and low Sr/Y magmatic rocks post-dates an earlier episode of low Sr/Y magmatism …

The deepest section of the tilted terrane, in the Kangaroo Mountain area near Seiad Valley, contains tectonic slices of ultramaﬁc, maﬁc, and sedimentary rocks that were penetratively deformed and metamorphosed under upper-amphibolite-to granulite-facies conditions. This section, called the Seiad complex, is the ophiolitic basement of an accreted Mesozoic island arc, and its polygenetic history reﬂects the magmatic and tectonic processes that occur during island-arc construction and evolution. The presence of metarodingite and metaserpentinite, and the concordance of structural elements and metamorphic grade among all units of the Seiad complex, indicate that initial tectonic disruption of the ophiolitic suite occurred in the upper crust and subsequent penetrative deformation and metamorphism occurred under hightemperature conditions in the deep crust. Crustal granulite-facies metamorphism is indicated by two-pyroxene metagabbroic bodies and two-pyroxene metasedimentary paragneiss. Geothermobarometric data from garnet amphibolite and granulite-facies metagabbro within the ophiolitic suite yielded pressure and temperature conditions of~ 5–7 kb and~ 650–750 ºC. Geochemical data from samples of granulite, amphibolite, and leucotrondhjemite suggest a supra-subduction origin, although there is signiﬁcant variation among the amphibolite samples, indicating multiple magma types. 
Schwartz Joshua|Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian calc-alkaline magmatism in the eastern Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina: U-Pb zircon and isotopic constrains|Joshua J SCHWARTZ, LP Gromet, R Miro|2003/11/2|2003 Seattle Annual Meeting|||||The Pampean orogen in the eastern Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina contains two paired magmatic belts, an eastern calc-alkaline magmatic arc and a western peraluminous granite/high-grade metasedimentary belt. Considerable uncertainty exists about the relationship between the two belts and their relative timing. New U-Pb zircon ages from a variety of granodiorites, monzogranites and a dacite from Sierra Norté and easternmost Sierras de Córdoba indicate that the calc-alkaline arc magmatism was active over a 35 myr. period from 555 to 520 Ma. There is no apparent relationship between composition and age, and only one sample showed any evidence of inheritance of older zircon components. Initial Sr and Nd isotopic compositions display evidence for significant crustal contributions to all these magmas. Initial eNd values range from-3.5 to-7.2 and Nd model ages range from 1.35 to 1.58 Ga. These isotopic results are similar to those of the peraluminous magmas, a surprising result given the marked petrological contrasts between these suites. Results from U-Pb analyses indicate that calc-alkaline magmatism largely preceded the development of peraluminous magmatism and high grade metamorphism in the western metasedimentary belt (525-515 Ma), and that the calc-alkaline magmatism abruptly terminated shortly after the peraluminous magmatism began. These temporal relationships and the metamorphic characteristics of the two belts appear to be in conflict with previously proposed models for the Pampean orogeny as a continental collision event, but are consistent with models that propose eastward-facing subduction of oceanic …

The 147 Sm-143 Nd ages for∼ 1 cm garnet grains in eclogite yield a 108.2±1.8 Ma (7 points) age and similar sized grains of garnet from granulite interlayered with eclogite yield a ca. 110.5±1.6 Ma (8 points) age. Both samples retain sparse domains with older ages of 123–121 Ma. Distinct Ca, Lu, and Hf zoning in garnet indicate that eclogite and granulite cooled rapidly enough to negate significant diffusion. The Ca zoning is interpreted to indicate significant garnet recrystallization during the granulite facies event, ca. 110 Ma. The older garnet ages are indistinguishable from the oldest 206 U/238 Pb zircon ages, ca. 123 and 120 Ma, in granulite orthogneiss that yielded two age … 
Schwartz Joshua|U-Pb ages from the Dadeville Complex, southernmost Appalachians, eastern Alabama: An accreted Taconic arc|Dane S VanDervoort, Mark G Steltenpohl, Joshua J Schwartz|2015|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|48|3|||The Inner Piedmont comprises a suspect terrane of high-grade metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and metaplutonic rocks that extends throughout the southern Appalachians. In eastern Alabama, the precise age and tectonic affinity of these rocks is not well defined. Some units previously correlated to the Inner Piedmont in Alabama are in fact a part of the eastern Blue Ridge terrane (ie, the Opelika Complex) so now only the Dadeville Complex is considered to have a true Inner Piedmont affinity. The Dadeville Complex is a package of interlayered amphibolite and felsic schist (Waresville Formation), layered to massive amphibolite and tonalitic gneiss (Ropes Creek Amphibolite), tonalitic gneiss (Waverly Gneiss), two different felsic intrusives suites (the Camp Hill Gneiss and the Rock Mills Granite Gneiss), and a migmatitic aluminous schist (Agricola Schist). The only previously reported age for Dadeville Complex rocks is a Rb-Sr whole-rock isochron age of 462±4 Ma for the Franklin Gneiss in western Georgia (ie, the Rock Mills Granite Gneiss in Alabama). Samples were collected from the type localities of six constituent units comprising the Dadeville Complex and their zircons were extracted for LA-SF-ICPMS dating. Magmatic zircons yielded 206Pb/238U ages of 493.4±6.0 Ma for the Waresville Formation, 476.6±6.8 Ma for the Ropes Creek Amphibolite, 477.1±4.8 Ma for the Waverly Gneiss, and 499.8±6.9 Ma for the Camp Hill Gneiss. Although zircons from the Rock Mills Granite Gneiss were too strongly altered for analysis, the previously reported Rb-Sr date is compatible with our new geochronologic results documenting Early to Middle … 
Schwartz Joshua|Contrasting Nd isotopic characteristics from the Baker terrane of northeastern Oregon: Implications for tectonic evolution|Joshua J SCHWARTZ|2005/10/16|2005 Salt Lake City Annual Meeting|||||In the Elkhorn Mountains of the Blue Mountains province of northeastern Oregon, the Bourne subterrane of the Baker terrane consists chiefly of dismembered Elkhorn Ridge Argillite and fault-bounded slabs of meta-igneous rocks. The Elkhorn Ridge Argillite is a mélange that includes widespread chert-argillite broken formation with scattered metalimestone olistoliths. Both Tethyan and McCloud Permian fauna have been reported from the metalimestone blocks, and Coward (1985) reported Early Jurassic radiolarians from the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite. The Baker terrane is commonly interpreted as an accretionary complex situated between late Paleozoic–early Mesozoic oceanic arcs, represented by the Wallowa and Old Ferry terranes. The meta-igneous rocks in the Bourne subterrane exhibit a relatively broad range in SiO2 content (~ 48-67 wt.%) and vary in texture from hornblende gabbro/diorite to lithic-clast volcaniclastic breccia. Siliceous argillite is locally stratigraphically above the meta-igneous rocks. Although the metaplutonic components of the meta-igneous suite locally exhibit high-temperature, solid-state foliation, these rocks are typically deformed by greenschist-facies cataclasis. Despite their range in SiO2 content, the meta-igneous rocks are characterized by strongly positive, initial epsilon Nd values (+ 7.8 to+ 8.3), indicating derivation from depleted mantle sources. In contrast, metamorphosed argillaceous rocks from the Elkhorn Ridge Argillite are characterized by distinctly negative (-4.4 to-7.0) initial epsilon Nd values and Nd model ages of 1.64-1.45 Ga, suggesting significant input from a Proterozoic provenance. The incorporation of …

The broader southern California area is a great place to study Cordilleran-style continental margin arcs built across diverse basements ranging from thinner oceanic to thicker continental crust. We will weave together several themes during this trip:(1) spatial variations, including in the vertical dimension, of arc magmatic and tectonic systems;(2) volcanic-plutonic links;(3) pluton sizes and shapes;(4) emplacement and tectonic/plutonic mass balance issues; and (5) arc magmatic and tectonic tempos. While doing so we plan to discuss/examine the main components of southern California Mesozoic magmatic systems while discussing temporally and spatially variable (1) melt sources,(2) processes in crustal columns, and (3) tectonic activity, all of which lead to the final preserved arcs. Bedrock and detrital zircon age patterns in a broad corridor across southern California define magmatic flare-up maxima in the Mojave area at ca. 250 Ma in a SE migrating arc, at ca. 170 Main a westward migrating arc, at ca. 100 Ma in the eastward migrating Peninsular Ranges Batholith (PRB), extending from just south of the Transverse Ranges and into Baja California, and additional smaller maxima at 81 and 73 Ma in the Transverse Ranges and Joshua Tree regions that may reflect the western edge of a broad region of melting and magmatism throughout the Basin and Range area. 
Schwartz Joshua|PTt paths from the Salmon River suture zone, west-central Idaho: Continental growth by island arc accretion.|Matthew P McKay, HH Stowell, JJ Schwartz, KD Gray|2011/5/20|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|33|4|76||The Salmon River Suture Zone (SRSZ) of west-central Idaho provides a unique glimpse into mid-lower crustal processes during continental growth by island arc accretion. The SRSZ separates island arc terranes of the Blue Mountains and the Mesozoic margin of North America. The rates, processes, and timing of terrane collision can be understood by studying metamorphism during crustal thickening. Prior work divided the SRSZ into two major structural blocks juxtaposed together by the Pollock Mountain fault: the overlying Pollock Mountain plate (PMp)-a polymetamorphic, polydeformational block dominated by amphibolite, and the underlying Rapid River (RRp) plate, a lower grade block dominated by phyllite and schist. Previous studies on the PMp suggest poorly understood pre-144 Ma metamorphism followed by metamorphism with a counter-clockwise PTt path [peak= 8-9 kbar~ 600 C]. The latter path was inferred to include garnet growth during cooling and rapid uplift resulting from lithospheric delamination, at ca. 128 Ma. New PTt paths for the RRp constructed from Sm-Nd garnet geochronology, geothermobarometry, isochemical PT phase diagram sections (pseudosections), and petrography suggest that slow cooling rates caused rim diffusion in garnet and retrograde temperature estimates producing a counter-clockwise PT path. Garnet zoning suggests that similar diffusive re-equilibration may have occurred in the PMp. A new garnet age of 112.5±1.5 Ma from the RRp and the 128 Ma garnet age to the SW (Getty et al, 1993) suggest that contractional crustal thickening could have been prolonged and occurred between 130-100 Ma … 
Schwartz Joshua|Structural character of the Wallowa-Baker terrane boundary: Implications for the tectonic evolution of the Blue Mountains Province, northeast Oregon|Joshua J SCHWARTZ|2007/10/29|2007 GSA Denver Annual Meeting|||||The boundary between the Baker and Wallowa terranes in the Blue Mountains province of NE Oregon is characterized by an imbricate fault zone consisting of slices of subduction-related, meta-igneous and metasedimentary rocks faulted into chert-argillite mélange. The meta-igneous slices exhibit a relatively broad range in SiO2 content (~ 48-67 wt.%) and vary in texture from hornblende gabbro/diorite to lithic-clast volcaniclastic breccia. Anastomosing, greenschist-facies cataclastic shear zones (< 5 cm thick) occur throughout the meta-igneous rocks, but are most abundant near major fault contacts. 206Pb/238U zircon ages from a (meta) tonalite and a (meta) diorite are 226.0±2.0 Ma and 231.4±1.0 Ma, respectively. These rocks have low initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.7033-0.7034) and strongly positive initial εNd values (+ 7.7 to+ 8.5). Associated Norian-age metasedimentary rocks have a broader range of initial 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.7046-0.7061, initial εNd values of-3.2 to+ 6.5, and calculated Nd model ages of 0.7 to 1.4 Ga. The matrix of the mélange consists primarily of Elkhorn Ridge Argillite and includes widespread chert-argillite broken formation with scattered metalimestone olistoliths. Both Tethyan and McCloud Permian fauna have been reported, and Coward (1985) reported radiolarians possibly as young as Early Jurassic. These rocks have initial 87Sr/86Sr values ranging from 0.7073 to 0.7094, initial εNd values between-4.7 and-7.8, and calculated Nd model ages of 1.4 to 1.6 Ga.

The SMCC comprises two variably deformed and mutually intrusive Miocene plutons, termed the South Mountains granodiorite (SMg) and the Telegraph Pass granite (TPg), both of which are intruded by syn-to post-kinematic felsic to mafic dike swarms. Extensional fabrics in the footwall are defined by crystal-plastically deformed quartz and brittlely fractured feldspars. The SMCC is unique because fabric development in the Tertiary footwall rocks cannot be attributed to older (eg, Cretaceous) deformation, thus presenting an opportunity to precisely determine timescales of mid-crustal deformation and mylonitic fabric development related to Miocene core complex faulting. Two samples were collected from the SMg, and one from the TPg. One SMg sample (SMg 1) was collected from the center of the core complex, whereas the second sample (SMg 2) was collected~ 1 km west of the first sample, away from any observed or mapped mafic dikes. The TPg sample was collected at the boundary between the SMg and TPg units, and is the least deformed footwall pluton sampled. The three samples yielded statistically indistinguishable 207 Pb c-corrected 206 Pb/238 U zircon SHRIMP-RG ages of 20.6±0.3 Ma (SMg 1), 20.8±0.2 Ma (SMg 2) and 20.1±0.5 Ma (TPg).

Schwartz Joshua|Loading and metamorphism within the Salmon River suture zone, west-central Idaho|Harold STOWELL|2011/10/12|2011 GSA Annual Meeting in Minneapolis|||||Medium-to high-grade schist and amphibolite of the Salmon River suture zone (SRSZ) in west-central Idaho record mid-crustal deformation during Jurassic to Cretaceous assembly of the Blue Mountains province and amalgamation to cratonic North America. These rocks provide important constraints on the rates, processes, and timing of terrane collision during crustal thickening. Pressure-temperature-time (PTt) paths from pseudosections, garnet compositional zoning, and thermobarometry suggest that tectonic loading was followed by near isobaric cooling. Counter-clockwise PTt paths are inferred from garnet core compositions, peak mineral assemblages, and mineral-rim compositions. Garnet Sm-Nd indicates that peak metamorphic ages vary across two major thrust plates: the Rapid River (RR) and Pollock Mountain (PM). High-grade amphibolite from the PM plate records 141-124 Ma garnet zone metamorphism (peak= 675ºC, 8 kbar) and is thrust on top of dominantly medium-grade schist from the RR plate that underwent 112.5 Ma garnet zone metamorphism (peak≤ 655ºC, 8.5 kbar). The discrepancy in age suggests that juxtaposition occurred after high-grade metamorphism in the PM plate and prior to medium-grade metamorphism in the RR plate. Thrusting and thermal relaxation or conductive heat flow from the Idaho batholith could be responsible for the younger metamorphism in the RR plate. However, the spatial distribution and the known ages of plutons are not compatible with contact metamorphism; therefore, a thrust origin is most likely. The medium-grade RR rocks were thrust over low-grade volcaniclastic rocks of the Seven … 
Schwartz Joshua|Migmatization and melt generation in the Monotonous Unit, Moldanubian Batholith, Czech Republic: implications of zircon Pb/U (SHRIMP-RG) ages and Hf isotope compositions|Brandy Bell, Kenneth Johnson, J Žák, Krystof Verner, Joshua J Schwartz|2011/5/19|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|43|4|66||The Monotonous Unit (or Ostrong Unit) extends from south-central Czech Republic into Austria and consists predominantly of HT-LP cordierite-sillimanite paragneisses and metagraywackes that were intruded by granites of the Moldanubian batholith. Variably migmatized paragneisses are exposed in a quarry near Vanov, along the eastern margin of the batholith. Styles of migmatization exposed in the quarry walls range from stromatic migmatite at one end, grading into migmatite with thin localized melt segregation structures and diatexite, and culminating in a large (10 mx 10 m) melt segregation (“pluton”) at the other end. The pluton is compositionally similar to leucosomes elsewhere in the quarry. Initial eHf (zircon) values range from-5.4 to+ 1.5 in the pluton, confirming its derivation from an isotopically evolved crustal source. Zircons from the pluton show a complex range of concordant Pb/U ages. The youngest 206 Pb/238 U ages average~ 330 Ma, which is similar to a Pb/U monazite age of~ 329 Ma from a migmatite stope block within the adjacent Mrákotín granite (éák et al., 2011). Inherited zircons yielded an older range of 206 Pb/238 U ages from~ 464 to 503 Ma, the youngest of which provides an upper limit to the timing of sedimentation for the paragneiss protolith. A second group of inherited zircons yielded 206 Pb/238 U ages of~ 559 to 600 Ma (Cadomian-age). Similar populations of inherited zircons have been observed in plutons elsewhere in the Moldanubian batholith, including the~ 303 Ma Cerínek pluton, which intruded the Mrákotín granite; it has inherited zircons with concordant 206 Pb/238 U ages from~ 439 to 493 Ma and one …

The inferred strain regimes changed from: (1) thrusting and sinistral shearing at ca. 160 Ma, to (2) horizontal stretching at ca. 147 Ma (in the forearc–accretionary wedge Baker terrane), to (3) dextral transpression that started from ca. 140 Ma onward and was associated with progressive anticlockwise rotation of the principal horizontal shortening direction from ca. 130 Ma to ca. 126 Ma (in the Wallowa oceanic arc terrane). These progressive strain reorientations are interpreted in terms of an outboard Wallowa-Baker terrane collision, lateral extrusion, docking of the amalgamated Blue Mountains superterrane into a continental-margin reentrant, and onset of …

The thermochronologic data were collected from the lower-crustal Indecision Creek Shear zone (ICSZ), located in northern Fiordland, and the mid-crustal Grebe Mylonite zone (GMZ), located in central Fiordland. New Pb/U zircon dates document the timing of Separation Point Suite magmatism in central Fiordland. We find that Separation Point Suite plutonism initiated with emplacement of the Refrigerator Orthogneiss at~ 129 Ma and was followed by emplacement of the Takahe granodiorite at 125-123 Ma, the Puteketeke pluton at~ 122 Ma and the West Arm Leucogranite from 122-110 Ma. Sub-solidus deformation in the Refrigerator Orthogneiss is bracketed by post-kinematic dikes between~ 129 and~ 122 Ma, but is absent in younger plutons. Titanite thermochronology reveals that localized, amphibolite-facies mylonitic deformation in the GMZ in Lake Manapouri is hosted in Carboniferous rocks and is dated at~ 121 to~ 117 Ma. Coeval deformation during the 125-117 Ma interval is recorded in a number of diffuse shear zones in Jurassic and Carboniferous plutons located 30 km to the north in South Fiord, Lake Te Anau.

Schwartz Joshua|OXYGEN ISOTOPE MAPPING REVEALS A CRUSTAL-SCALE STRUCTURE WITHIN THE MEDIAN BATHOLITH, FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|S Andico, Joshua J Schwartz, Andy Tulloch, Rose Turnbull, Keith Klepeis, Elena A Miranda, Kouki Kitajima, MF Ringwood|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||The Median Batholith in New Zealand is a complex, Cordilleran-type batholith that formed along the southeast Gondwana margin from the late Paleozoic to late Mesozoic. Previous studies have proposed that the Median Batholith intruded a fundamental temporal and lithologic discontinuity between allochthonous, primarily oceanic-affinity rocks to the east (Eastern Province) and primarily Gondwana-affinity rocks to the west (Western Province). However, the crustal architecture of this boundary is obscured by voluminous intrusions of Mesozoic Darran and Separation Point Suite plutons. Here, we use zircon oxygen isotope SIMS data from lower and middle crustal plutons to provide new insights into the crustal-scale structure within the Median Batholith and its significance as a boundary between the Eastern and Western Provinces. We present over 500 δ O (zircon) isotope analyses from 66 samples distributed across~ 9,000 km of Fiordland. Isotope data reveals three isotopic domains separated by 0.7 to 1.0‰ discontinuities. The western isotopic domain includes lower crustal Western Fiordland Orthogneiss rocks and has mantle-like δ O values ranging from+ 5.3 to+ 6.1‰. The eastern isotopic domain includes mid-crustal Darran and Separation Point Suite plutons, and is characterized by lower δ O values ranging from+ 3.7 to+ 4.5‰. The central isotopic domain includes plutons from mid-crustal Darran and Separation Point Suite and lower-crustal Arthur River Complex and Western Fiordland Orthogneiss. This domain is characterized by transitional isotopic values that display a strong EW gradient with δ O values rising from+ 4.5 in the east to+ 5 …

Thirteen blocks, ranging from 30 to 1000 meters in length, consist of coarse-grained, foliated hornblende, garnet (Alm 53-56, Py 12-15, Gr 26-28, Sp 4-7), epidote, sphene, apatite, and rutile. Notable are the lack of plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the hornblendites. Quartz and feldspathic veins cross-cut the hornblendite. The garnet hornblendites are broadly basaltic in composition and have slightly LREE-depleted chondrite-normalized patterns similar to N-MORB, and to basalts and gabbros from the Canyon Mountain ophiolitic complex, 30 km to the west. The lack of plagioclase in these rocks is reflected in their low Na 2 O contents, relative to N-MORB and Canyon Mountain basalts. The garnet hornblendites in this area may represent: 1) a high-pressure residual assemblage from a partial melting event, exhumed from a deep crustal source, 2) a high-pressure cumulate from an evolving water-rich magma, or 3) high-grade equivalents of oceanic crust or ophiolitic affinity. In an effort to address these hypotheses, we estimated the melt composition that would have been in equilibrium with garnet and hornblende, using the garnet/liquid and clinopyroxene/liquid partition coefficients, respectively, of Klein et al.(2000, GCA, v. 64, pp. 99-115). The results suggest that a melt composition in equilibrium with these phases would have been LREE-depleted, very different to that expected for a high-Al 2 O 3 tonalitic/trondhjemitic magma with a …

We use Pb/U ages of igneous zircon from lower crustal gabbros and sea-surface magnetic data from Atlantis Bank to determine half-spreading rates during detachment faulting. We suggest that these rates, which record crustal accretion and cooling of lower crust in the Antarctic plate, also reflect the time-averaged rate of motion on the detachment fault. During the time Atlantis Bank formed, from 11.2-12.5 Ma, both techniques yield a half-spreading rate of 14±1km/Ma. The magnetically determined full-spreading rate has been 14km/Ma since 20Ma and magnetic data from neighboring segments show that this full spreading rate did not …

Schwartz Joshua|Deep Slab Collision during Miocene Subduction Causes Uplift along Crustal-Scale Reverse Faults in Fiordland, New Zealand|Keith Klepeis, Laura Webb, Hannah Blatchford, Joshua Schwartz, Richard Jongens, Rose Turnbull, Harold Stowell|2019/7|GSA today|||||A new multidisciplinary project in southwest New Zealand that combines geological and geophysical data shows how and why deep lithospheric dis‐placements were transferred vertically through the upper plate of an incipient ocean-continent subduction zone. A key discovery includes two zones of steep, downward-curving reverse faults that uplifted and imbricated large slices of Cretaceous lower, middle, and upper crust in the Late Miocene. Geochemical and structural analyses combined with 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and published images from seismic tomography suggest that the reverse faults formed at 8–7 Ma as a consequence of a deep (~ 100 km) collision between subducting oceanic lithosphere and previously subducted material. This collision localized shortening and reactivated two crustalscale shear zones from the upper mantle to Earth’s surface. The event, which is summarized in a new lithosphericscale profile, is helping us answer some long-standing questions about the origin of Fiordland’s unique lower-crustal exposures and what they tell us about how inherited structures can transfer motion vertically through the lithosphere as subduction initiates.

The recently discovered Broughton Arm Peridotite in the mountains of central Fiordland is exposed as two 75–150 m wide by several hundred metres-long harzburgite-dunite lobes encased sequentially in hornblendite, amphibolite and then quartzofeldspathic gneiss. On the basis of the refractory harzburgitic-dunitic composition and the bulk rock Mg# (86–87) lower than most mantle peridotites, the peridotite is interpreted to have an igneous cumulate rather than an exhumed mantle peridotite origin. The marginal hornblendite and amphibolite and internal pods of edenite-diopside rock may represent metasomatised peridotite. The Broughton Arm Peridotite has been metamorphosed twice. The first event generated an anhydrous assemblage comprising olivine (Mg# = 79.4–92.8), enstatite and Cr … 
Schwartz Joshua|Directly Dating High-Temperature Deformation: Dynamic Recrystallization and U-Pb resetting of Titanite|Amy Catherine Moser, BR Hacker, J Schwartz|2018/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||An outstanding challenge in geochronology and structural geology is the ability to directly date crystal-plastic deformation. Titanite (CaTiSiO 5) is the best candidate for a deformation chronometer: it is a common accessory mineral in crustal rocks, it has a high U-Pb closure temperature (>= 800 C), monitors host-rock conditions with its trace-element composition, accommodates crystal-plastic deformation at moderate to high temperature (greenschist to granulite facies), and may preserve deformation microstructures as a result. Samples from the Anita shear zone, South Island, New Zealand, demonstrate the potential of titanite as a deformation chronometer through the comparison of microstructure (from electron-backscatter diffraction imaging), U-Pb date, and trace-element composition. Titanite in the Anita shear zone formed at 600 C and 8-9 kbar, and are part of a subvertical fabric that records dextral transpression …

U/Pb zircon ages and pluton areas indicate that a high magmatic flux event between 118 and 115 Ma added> 3,000 km2 of mid-to lower-crustal plutons. The high flux event was followed by high temperature metamorphism and partial melting which resulted in pervasive leucosomes, and trondhjemite layers and veins. At least 1,800 km2 of the newly added crust was metamorphosed to garnet granulite facies orthogneiss. Thermobarometry and phase diagram models indicate that garnet grew at 850 to 1,000 C and 12 to 14 kbar in this monzodiorite and diorite gneiss of the Misty, Malaspina, and Breaksea plutons.

We present petrographic and microstructural observations, garnet geochemistry, pressure-temperature isochemical phase diagrams, and Sm-Nd garnet and U-Pb zircon ages to investigate the timing and conditions of metamorphism in the Salmon River suture zone. The Salmon River suture zone is comprised of three thrust sheets: from east to west, the amphibolite facies Pollock Mountain plate, upper greenschist to amphibolite facies Rapid River plate, and greenschist facies Heavens Gate plate. The Pollock Mountain plate was isothermally loaded from 6 to >8 kbar at ~700 °C between 141 and 124 Ma during northwest-southeast crustal shortening. The underlying Rapid River plate was isothermally loaded from 7 to ~10 kbar at 600–650 °C during ca. 124–112 Ma metamorphism, which is contemporaneous with late- to post-peak metamorphism and ca. 118 Ma exhumation of the overlying Pollock Mountain plate. In the Rapid River plate, thrust sheet emplacement induced high-strain ductile deformation and led to regional development of linear-planar fabrics. The 206Pb/238U zircon ages for syndeformational to postdeformational magmatism record ca. 117 Ma or younger juxtaposition of the two plates on the southeast-dipping Pollock Mountain thrust fault.

Schwartz Joshua|DO MID-CRUSTAL CORDILLERAN BATHOLITHS RECORD ARC FLARE-UP TRIGGERING PROCESSES?|Joshua J Schwartz, Andrew J Tulloch, S Andico, Harold H Stowell, Keith A Klepeis, Kouki Kitajima, John Valley|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||Triggering mechanisms responsible for Cordilleran arc flare-ups are hotly debated and there is little consensus about whether magmatic surges are driven by upper-plate processes (eg, underthrusting of fertile continental crust) or mantle processes (eg, slab tears/break-off). Radiogenic and stable isotopes in shallow-to mid-crustal batholithic rocks are commonly employed to provide insights into flare-up processes; however, it is unclear whether these rocks accurately record triggering processes, versus intra-crustal processing during transport through the crust and/or deep-crustal remelting and mixing. We compare and contrast isotopic signatures from both mid-and lower crustal batholithic rocks in the Early Cretaceous portion of the 260-105 Ma Median Batholith, Fiordland, New Zealand to provide insights into this debate. We find that zircons from mafic to intermediate rocks in the lower crustal Western Fiordland Orthogneiss record a narrow isotopic range, with pluton-average zircon δ O values ranging from 5.3 to 6.1‰, and εHf values ranging from+ 2.9 to+ 5.0. These zircons show no evidence for interaction with crust, and we interpret them as having equilibrated with an enriched, subarc, lithospheric mantle melt. By contrast, mid-crustal rocks have more complex isotopic systematics that reflect variable interaction with a hydrothermally altered source. Eastern Separation Point Suite zircons from the Titiroa and Takahe plutons give δ O zircon values ranging from 3.7 to 3.9‰, and εHf values ranging from+ 7.2 to+ 7.6. Western Separation Point Suite zircons from the Puteketeke, Refrigerator Orthogneiss and West Arm Leucogranite show a strong, EW … 
Schwartz Joshua|PARTITIONING OF STRAIN IN MID-AND LOWER-CRUSTAL LEVELS DURING AN ARC FLARE-UP, MEDIAN BATHOLITH, FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|Hannah J Blatchford, Keith A Klepeis, Joshua J Schwartz, Rose Turnbull, Richard Jongens, Matthew A Coble|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||In Fiordland, New Zealand, rocks of the Western Fiordland Orthogneiss batholith were emplaced into the middle and lower crust of a continental arc that formed along the margin of Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous. We used structural analyses, Pb/U zircon dates (SHRIMP-RG), and Pb/U titanite dates (LASS-ICP-MS) to examine relationships among deformation, metamorphism, and pluton emplacement at different crustal levels during and after a flare-up in arc magmatism. At Adams Burn, in central Fiordland, Tertiary thrust faults juxtapose middle and lower crustal levels. Here, exposures of the lower crust record emplacement of the Early Cretaceous, mostly dioritic, Misty Pluton. The pluton’s eastern contact is marked by the Misty shear zone (MSZ), a~ 1 km thick, NE-striking and moderately NW-dipping, gneissic and migmatitic domain that records sinistral-reverse shearing parallel to the axis of the arc. The timing of shearing is bracketed by zircon dates: a published date interpreted to represent pluton crystallization at 122.6±1.9 Ma, and an undeformed, post-tectonic dike dated at 119.9±2.0 Ma. Igneous flow fabrics parallel shear fabrics, suggesting the shear zone developed during pluton emplacement. Structurally below the MSZ to the east, mid-crustal rocks are deformed by a gently dipping, highstrain zone named the South Adams Burn thrust (SABT) that records shortening orthogonal to the trend of the arc. The timing of deformation in the SABT is bracketed by new zircon dates from a pre-tectonic dike (113.7±2.3 Ma) and a crosscutting undeformed tonalite pluton of the West Arm Leucogranite (111±1.1 Ma). Titanite in sheared calc-silicate …

High-strain zones within the distributed shear zone crop out along the northern coast of South Fiord in Lake Te Anau, and the exposures lie several km along strike to the north of the GMZ, but it is unknown if the zones are coeval and record the same deformation conditions. We present EBSD results from two samples collected from the high-strain zones: a granodiorite mylonite (17NZ42), and a diorite mylonite (17NZ58) that represent the compositional heterogeneity of the shear zone. Field observations of the distributed shear zone reveal trends in orientation and shear sense. Mylonitic foliations primarily strike SW and dip moderately to steeply NW. We observed predominantly sinistral shear sense indicators within the mylonites, correlating with a component of top-to-the-west, normal-sense of movement in high strain zones of the distributed sinistral shear zone. The mylonitic foliation orientations are similar to those we measure in the GMZ (strike SW, dip steeply NW), and the sense of motion is consistent with our interpretation of kinematic indicators in the GMZ.

The Grebe Mylonite Zone (GMZ) in central Fiordland, New Zealand, is a mid-crustal shear zone developed within Carboniferous-age granite, tonalite, and diorite host rocks, and its association with voluminous, mid-crustal Separation Point Suite (SPS) plutons suggests a fundamental link between arc magmatism and shear zone deformation. We present data from two representative GMZ samples here: 17NZ95C1 (biotite diorite mylonite), and 17NZ96 (granite mylonite). In both samples, quartz and plagioclase show contrasting amounts of crystal plasticity and LPO development. In 17NZ95C1, elongate plagioclase and biotite define the foliation, and the quartz is interstitial in nature; quartz displays some Dauphine twins and has slightly rounded to straight grain boundaries, and plagioclase exhibits some deformation twinning and rare lobate grain boundaries. In 17NZ95C1, plagioclase exhibits moderate LPO consistent with the {001}< 100> slip system, and quartz has no LPO. In 17NZ96, quartz has Dauphine twins and has some irregular grain boundaries where pinned. Plagioclase porphyroclasts have some deformation twins, lack subgrain development, and are surrounded by elongate recrystallized grains without host control orientation relationships, suggesting limited crystal plasticity. In 17NZ96, plagioclase has a weak LPO that is inconsistent with the kinematic reference frame, and quartz has a moderate LPO indicating basal< a> slip. 
Schwartz Joshua|UNRAVELING A HISTORY OF REPEATED FAULT REACTIVATIONS AND DIFFERENTIAL UPLIFT ABOVE A YOUNG SUBDUCTION ZONE IN SW NEW ZEALAND|Keith Klepeis, Laura E Webb, Hannah J Blatchford, Joshua J Schwartz, Rose Turnbull, Richard Jongens|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||The Fiordland region of New Zealand’s South Island is one of only a few places where it is possible to directly observe the sequence of events associated with subduction initiation. The Puysegur trench, which is part of the Pacific-Australian plate boundary near Fiordland, is thought to have formed in Miocene times. However, its evolution and relationship to other events, including episodes of crustal deformation and rapid exhumation within the upper plate, are uncertain. We used structural observations, Pb/U rutile and titanite dates, and high-precision Ar/Ar geochronology on pseudotachylyte, mylonite, and other fault rocks to construct a multistage history of faulting and differential uplift across Fiordland since~ 30 Ma. The integrated data allowed us to distinguish successive phases of faulting (ie, reactivations) from cases where different styles of brittle and ductile deformation occurred together. The results show that central Fiordland records the beginning of pure reverse motion and uplift on faults that parallel the Puysegur trench at 8-7.5 Ma. This event followed a long period of mostly dextral strike-slip deformation that began at 25-20 Ma and intensified at 14-10 Ma as convergent rates increased. Another shortening event occurred at 6-4 Ma when trench-parallel faults were reactivated again, placing a slice of Cretaceous lower crust up and to the east over middle crust. Both events were shortlived and produced melts interlayered with mylonite, suggesting transient, high-velocity slip. After~ 4 Ma, motion on trench-parallel faults in central Fiordland changed back to strike-slip, as zones of shortening and uplift migrated north and east, away from the … 
Schwartz Joshua|RESOLVING THE AGES AND NATURE OF INTRUSION, METAMORPHISM AND PARTIAL MELTING IN MIGMATITE: AN EXAMPLE FROM FIORDLAND, NZ|Harold Stowell, Joshua J Schwartz, Andrew J Tulloch, Karen Odom Parker, Keith A Klepeis|2017/1|Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|||||Zircon and garnet geochronometers (U-Pb, Sm-Nd, & Lu-Hf) are used for understanding outcrop-and orogenic-scale processes in lower crustal rocks. These isotopic systems often yield a range of ages that may reflect igneous and metamorphic processes. Therefore, ages can be difficult to interpret without additional data. Migmatite from the Malaspina Pluton provides an excellent example because zircon and garnet are found in a wide variety of textures. Textural occurrences and trace element mineral compositions provide critical constraints for age interpretation and the origin of leucosomes. Garnet and zircon occur in cross-cutting leucosomes, vein selvages, adjacent garnet reaction zones (GRZ), and host orthogneiss. These leucosomes have been interpreted as in-situ or externally derived melts. Zircon dates cannot be grouped into populations based on spatial occurrence or on CL type; however, there are distinct age and compositional groups. Zircon from host and GRZ have chondrite-normalized REE patterns with enriched Ce, small negative Eu anomalies, and HREE enrichments with positive slopes. Trace element compositions of zircon define 2 populations with high HREE & Hf (host) and low HREE & Hf (GRZ). In addition, zircon from host and GRZ show distinct Th versus U trends, indicating that older GRZ zircon are not derived from the host rock. Single crystal Pb/U zircon ages are 118.3±0.1 to 115.7±0.1 Ma (CA-TIMS) and Pb/U zircon spot ages are ca. 121 to 110 Ma with some young cores (SHRIMP-RG). Sm-Nd garnet ages from ca. 1 cm grains in vein selvages and porphyroblasts not associated with leucosome veins are 112.8±2.2 …

U-Pb detrital zircon ages for 100 grains from the stratigraphically lowest recognized unit of the Moine Supergroup, the Morar Group (sample KMK-MT-07), were analyzed and 80 were less than 10% discordant. KMK-MT-07 has a broad major peak at 1640 Ma (52.5% of grains in sample create this peak). This major peak is skewed by a secondary hump at 1196 Ma (accounting for 21.3% of all grains). There are two minor peaks at 2618 Ma (3.8%) and 3200 Ma (3.8%). A major trough occurs between 1280 Ma and 1500 Ma (6.3%) and a minor trough appears between 1750 Ma and 2000 Ma (12.5%).

Although the precise timing of these events is important for constructing tectonic histories, it is often difficult to determine due to uncertain relationships between isotopic signatures, mineral growth, and textural features that record strain. In addition, there may be large uncertainties in isotope data due to intracrystalline diffusion and multiple crystallization events. LS tectonites in lower crustal rocks from Fiordland, NZ record the early stages of extensional collapse of thickened magmatic arc crust. The precise age of these fabrics is important for constraining the timing of extension that led to opening of the Tasman Sea. High temperature granulite facies LS fabrics in garnet reaction zones (GRZ) border syn-to post-deformational leucosomes. U-Pb zircon … 
Schwartz Joshua|NORTH AMERICAN CORDILLERA|Jiří Žák, Kryštof Verner, Filip Tomek, František V Holub, Kenneth Johnson, Joshua J Schwartz|2015/6/11|MAGNETIC FABRIC, MAGMA FLOW AND TECTONIC DEFORMATION IN VOLCANO–PLUTONIC SYSTEMS|||94|Institute of Geology|The North American Cordillera is a classic example of accretionary orogen, consisting of multiple oceanic terranes attached to the western margin of Laurentia during the Mesozoic times. Although the Cordillera is linear for most parts, terrane boundaries are at a high angle to the overall structural grain in several segments of the orogen, which has been a matter of longstanding controversy as to how and when these orogenic curvatures formed. This paper discusses mechanisms, kinematics, and timing of initiation of one of these major curvatures, the Blue Mountains Province in northeastern Oregon. Here, magmatic fabric patterns and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in the Wallowa batholith record three phases of progressive deformation of the host Wallowa terrane during Early Cretaceous. First is terrane-oblique~ NE–SW shortening, interpreted as recording attachment of the amalgamated oceanic and fringing, continental-margin terranes to the continental margin during dextral convergence at~ 140 Ma. Deformation subsequently switched to pure shear-dominated~ NNE–SSW shortening associated with crustal thickening, caused by continued impingement of the amalgamated Blue Mountains superterrane into a presumed westward-concave reentrant in the continental margin at~ 135–128 Ma. Upon impingement (at~ 126 Ma), the northern portion of the superterrane became‛ locked’, leading to reorientation of the principal shortening direction to~ NNW–SSE while its still deformable southern portion rotated clockwise about a vertical axis. We thus propose oblique bending as the main mechanism of the orocline formation whereby …

A sample from the Houstanaden Creek Formation (GBt) yielded a unimodal zircon population at 146 Ma. Jurassic zircons from the Dothan Formation (YBt) gave more varied Jurassic age populations of 144, 159, 185 Ma and Precambrian zircons with age distribution peaks at 1045, 1244, 1441, 1728 and 1816 Ma. Two samples from the Rocky Point Formation and the Humbug Mountain Conglomerate (WKt) yielded Jurassic peak populations at 156, 171, 181, 198 Ma, minor Triassic peaks at 226 and 234 Ma, and Precambrian age peaks at 1094 and 1208 Ma. These Jurassic and Triassic age populations are common in exposed plutonic rocks in the western US Cordillera (eg, Klamath Mountains, Northern Sierras, Blue Mountains province) and likely indicate derivation from proximal sources with contribution from transcontinental sands shed from the greater Ouachita-Appalachian orogeny and southwest Laurentian cratonic sources.

Forward models in PT space can be used to construct isochemical PT paths for metamorphism. However, pseudosections incorporating variable effective bulk compositions (EBC) are needed to help explain some mineral zoning and complex processes like partial melting. Partial melting introduces a new phase, dehydrates the protolith, and produces new minerals. The complication of partial melting requires investigation of both the protolith and melt. In this study, we first determine representative EBC critical to the construction of useful models. Second, we determine a reasonable water content for each EBC by producing T vs. H2O diagrams at isobaric conditions. To evaluate the effects of partial melting, we use bulk compositions for the unmelted host, the partially melted rock (GRZ) and melt. Changing bulk compositions allows only one other intensive variable and models are either isothermal or isobaric. 
Schwartz Joshua|TRACKING THE INFLUENCE OF CRUSTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEEP ROOT OF A CONTINENTAL ARC, FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|John A WIESENFELD, Joshua J SCHWARTZ, Harold H STOWELL, Joseph Frank SADORSKI, Kyzara BURGH, Keith KLEPEIS, Andy TULLOCH|2014/10/20|2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia|||||The exhumed root of the Jurassic to Cretaceous arc in central Fiordland, New Zealand preserves a well-exposed section of> 2000 km 2 of middle and lower arc crust, nearly 70% of which was emplaced during a brief, high-flux event from 118-115 Ma. A key problem in understanding the growth of continental crust in magmatic arcs centers on the mechanisms by which high-flux events are triggered. Previous workers have proposed that high-flux events may be triggered by underthrusting of continental crust thereby inducing melting by introducing ‘fertile’crust to elevated geothermal gradients. By contrast, high flux events may also be triggered by mantle upwelling as a result of delamination and/or lithospheric extension. Here we integrate U-Pb zircon geochronology with existing whole-rock initial isotope data from the arc root in Fiordland to evaluate the relative contributions of depleted mantle and pre-existing crust through time during Cretaceous arc magmatism. Our results show that whole rock initial values decrease from+ 3 to+ 5 during early, low flux magmatism at 160-120 Ma to lower values of 0 to+ 3 during peak magmatic flux at 118-115 Ma. The decrease in initial is also correlated with a sharp increase in whole rock Sr/Y values (from≤ 60 to> 300) over the same time interval. We interpret the decrease in initial to result from increased crustal melting during peak magmatic flux due to underthrusting of continental crust beneath Fiordland. The observed negative correlation between initial and Sr/Y values supports this hypothesis, as it suggests an increase in garnet stability and a decrease in plagioclase stability in the source region of the … 
Schwartz Joshua|TIMESCALES OF INTRA-ARC CONTRACTION AND EXTENSIONAL COLLAPSE IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE CRUST OF A CRETACEOUS CONVERGENT-MARGIN MAGMATIC ARC, CENTRAL FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|Hannah SHAMLOO, Joshua J SCHWARTZ, Keith A KLEPEIS, Harold H STOWELL, Joseph Frank SADORSKI, Matthew A COBLE|2014/10/19|2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia|||||The Fiordland orogen preserves an exhumed Mesozoic continental arc that records the transition from subduction-related magmatism and contraction along the Gondwana margin to extensional orogenic collapse that led to opening of the Tasman Sea. One of the least understood aspects of the orogenic development of Fiordland is the timescale of intra-arc contraction and its temporal relationship to magmatic arc construction and extensional collapse in the lower crust beginning at ca. 112 Ma. The contractional history of Fiordland is preserved in Caswell Sound, where contraction is manifested by a doubly verging fold-thrust belt characterized by garnet granulite and upper amphibolite-facies thrust faults that sole into a subhorizontal shear zone. In this region, a suite of biotite-hornblende diorite to granodiorite (western McKerr Intrusives: wMI) and their metasedimentary host rocks are thrust over the Misty Pluton (MP). Both MP and wMI are intruded by post-kinematic granitic dikes that cross-cut shallowly dipping mylonitc fabrics. We sampled the wMI, MP, and a post-kinematic dike from the eastern end of the Caswell fold-thrust belt to determine the timing of magmatism and intra-arc contraction in the region. Two samples from the wMI yielded 206 Pb/238 U SHRIMP-RG zircon ages of 118.4±1.3 Ma and 117.7±1.7 Ma, respectively. A sample of the MP from the footwall of the Caswell fold-thrust belt yielded an age of 116.9±1.8 Ma. Finally, a post kinematic granitic dike yielded an age of 112.2±2.0 Ma. These data indicate that contractional deformation in the Caswell fold-thrust belt is restricted to ca. 117 to 112 Ma, and is partially coeval with the final … 
Schwartz Joshua|THE TEMPO OF CONTINENTAL MARGIN ARC CONSTRUCTION AND EXTENSIONAL OROGENIC COLLAPSE: A DEEP-CRUSTAL PERSPECTIVE FROM FIORDLAND, NEW ZEALAND|Joshua J SCHWARTZ, Harold STOWELL, Keith KLEPEIS, Andy TULLOCH, Matthew A COBLE, Andrew KYLANDER-CLARK, Brad HACKER|2014/10/19|2014 GSA Annual Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia|||||The exhumed root of the Fiordland orogen offers a deep-crustal view into the life cycle of a continental-margin arc from magmatic construction to extensional orogenic collapse. We integrate U-Pb and Sm-Nd geo-and thermochronologic data from zircon, garnet, titanite, and rutile with structural observations from> 1200 km 2 of the arc root to document the tempo of deep-crustal magmatism, high-temperature metamorphism, extension and cooling in central Fiordland. Results from U-Pb SHRIMP-RG zircon geochronology reveal two principal phases of Cretaceous, deep-crustal plutonism at ca. 125-120 Ma and 118-115 Ma. The latter phase of magmatism resulted in the emplacement of nearly 70% of the arc root and constituted a major flux of high Sr/Y magmas. Metamorphic zircon from Paleozoic host orthogneisses, trondhjemitic leucosomes and garnet reaction zones yield ages of 119-117 Ma, and metamorphic zircons from calc-silicates yield ages of 116-112 Ma. Garnet TIMS Sm-Nd ages from Cretaceous orthogneisses, garnet-reaction zones and trondhjemitic leucosomes range from 115-110 Ma. Outcrop-and microstructural-scale observations indicate that granulite-facies shearing initiated at ca. 116-110 Ma resulting in widely distributed zones of lower crustal flow. These data signify that regional granulite-facies metamorphism was partially synchronous with deep-crustal magmatism, partial melting and high-temperature, crystal-plastic deformation.

Zircons yielded a Pb/U (SHRIMP-RG) age of 157.5±1.3 Ma, making it one of the oldest Late Mesozoic plutons in the Blue Mountains province. The FLC comprises two-pyroxene (±relict olivine) gabbro that is cross-cut by andesitic and tonalitic dikes. Gabbros commonly exhibit igneous lamination, and have geochemical characteristics suggestive of a cumulate origin, including high Al 2 O 3 (up to 21 wt.%), low SREE, and pronounced positive Eu-anomalies. The FLC represents one of only a few examples of demonstrably mantle-derived magmatism in the Blue Mountains province during Late Jurassic time; knowledge of FLC magmatism and mantle processes is therefore crucial for understanding other Late Jurassic plutons in this region. Trace element abundances in unexsolved clinopyroxene were determined by laser ablation-ICP-MS. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of clinopyroxene are concave-downward and have slight negative Eu-anomalies. Melt compositions in equilibrium with clinopyroxene were calculated using these data and the cpx-melt partition coefficients of Klein et al.(2000, GCA v. 64, pp. 99-115). The calculated REE patterns are LREE-enriched, exhibit negative Eu-anomalies, and are similar to those of andesitic dikes in the FLC. These results are in agreement with major element data.

Macquarie Island is unique among oceanic ophiolite sequences in that it is still located in the basin in which it formed. The northernmost part of Macquarie Island is composed primarily of lower crustal gabbro and upper mantle peridotite, and therefore provides a unique window into lower oceanic crust. Here, we report integrated Pb/U zircon ages and Lu-Hf isotopic and trace element data from six samples of the lower crust-upper mantle sequence. Samples consist of two lower crustal gabbros, and three mantle-hosted gabbro dikes/dikelettes and one phlogopite-bearing vein from the upper mantle sequence. 206 Pb/238 U SHRIMP-RG zircon error weighted average ages for the lower crustal gabbros are 8.7±0.3 Ma (N= 9) and 9.0±0.2 Ma …

It intrudes a complex structural boundary containing imbricated slabs of hornblende metagabbro (likely derived from the Wallowa island-arc terrane), which are tectonically interleaved within the Permian to Early Jurassic Elkhorn Ridge Argillite of the Baker terrane. The batholith itself contains a number of smaller plutons including an inner core of granodiorite (Granodiorite of Anthony Lake) surrounded by a large tonalite unit (Tonalite of Bald Mountain), and smaller peripheral bodies of norite (eg, Norite of Badger Butte) and granite (eg, Granite of Anthony Butte). Despite detailed field mapping by Taubeneck (1957, 1995), relatively little is known about the timing of magmatism and the petrogenesis of the Bald Mountain batholith. Here, we present new U-Pb and combined Hf-O isotopic data for zircon from six samples representing the main-stage units of the Bald Mountain batholith. Our 206 Pb/238 U zircon ages (2σ) indicate that magmatic construction of the batholith commenced with the emplacement of a mafic-felsic suite including the Norite of Badger Butte (156.9±1.4 Ma) and the Granite of Anthony Butte (154.7±1.3 Ma). A second phase of tonalite-granodiorite magmatism resulted in the emplacement of the inner core of the batholith (Granodiorite of Anthony Lake: 146.7±2.1 Ma) followed by intrusion of the largest unit, the Tonalite of Bald Mountain; three samples of tonalite yielded ages of 142.6±1.5 Ma, 141.2±1.9 Ma, and 140.9±2.0 Ma. Plutons of the norite-granite suite display a …

Timescales of deformation, metamorphism and magmatism in this region of the Cordillera are poorly constrained, hindering detailed understanding of the timing of tectonic events and the magmatic and metamorphic processes accompanying them. In the Mountain Home Metamorphic Complex (MHMC), an enigmatic sequence of medium-grade metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks is intruded by two groups of variably deformed plutons. Metamorphic rocks include chlorite+ biotite+ garnet±sillimanite±staurolite schist, and keratophyre and metatuff which grade into chlorite schist near fault contacts. This degree of metamorphism is uncommon in the BMP, and contrasts with adjacent rocks in the Baker and Wallowa terranes. Two distinct plutonic suites intrude metamorphic host rocks: 1) deformed hornblende tonalite and trondhjemite (Group 1), and 2) undeformed biotite-hornblende tonalite, biotite-hornblende quartz diorite, and hornblende gabbronorite (Group 2). Quartz microstructures in deformed plutons display evidence for grain-boundary migration and subgrain-rotation recrystallization, features which are absent in Group 2 plutons. 206 Pb/238 U zircon ages for Group 1 plutons range from 161.3 to 149.5 Ma; whereas Group 2 plutons yield ages ranging from 147.8 Ma to 145.5 Ma. These ages bracket deformation to between 149.5 to 147.9 Ma, which contrasts with the timing of previously documented tectonic events in the BMP. Initial εHf values range from+ 16.3 to+ 10.2 in …

In the Blue Mountains province (NE Oregon), Late Jurassic, high Sr/Y plutons (148-145 Ma) intrude Middle Jurassic, low Sr/Y arc-related rocks (162-157 Ma) in the Greenhorn subterrane of the Baker terrane immediately after widespread Late Jurassic arc-arc collision (159-154 Ma). Pre-to syn-kinematic, low Sr/Y lavas and plutons (162-157 Ma) have flat to slightly enriched rare earth element (REE) patterns (La/Yb< 10), low Sr (< 400 ppm) and Sr/Y values (< 40), and strongly positive initial epsilon 176 Hf/177 Hf values (+ 10.1 to+ 12.3). Ce/Y values indicate a maximum crustal thickness of~ 23 km. These features are consistent with derivation from a depleted-mantle source and/or shallow-level (<< 40 km) melting of pre-existing island arc crust with little to no evolved crustal input. In contrast, post-kinematic high Sr/Y plutons (148-145 Ma) are more compositionally restricted consisting of tonalite, trondhjemite and granodiorite, and display steeply fractionated REE patterns (La/Yb> 10), an absence of Eu anomalies, elevated Sr (> 600 ppm) and Sr/Y values (> 40), and positive initial epsilon 176 Hf/177 Hf values (+ 10.5 to+ 7.8). These results are consistent with geochemical models involving partial melting of pre-existing island arc crust in the presence of a plagioclase-poor to absent, clinopyroxene+ hornblende+ garnet-bearing source (depths> 35-40 km). We propose that the transition from low …

This boundary juxtaposes late Paleozoic through Early Jurassic (?) Elkhorn Ridge Argillite and associated mélange of the Bourne subterrane against serpentinite-matrix mélange of the Greenhorn subterrane. In the Desolation Butte area, the boundary between the two subterranes is characterized by numerous brittle faults, intense brecciation, and extensive networks of cataclastic shear zones. At the contact between the two subterranes, an intense greenschist-facies shear zone separates serpentinite, metavolcanic, and metaplutonic rocks of the Greenhorn subterrane from intensely brecciated Elkhorn Ridge Argillite of the Bourne subterrane. The orientation of this fault zone ranges from approximately northwest-southeast in the Desolation Butte area, to nearly east-west in adjoining areas. Fault surfaces dip at~ 50-80 to the south-southeast and scattered minor brittle-fault features suggest top-to-the-northwest. In the footwall of the fault zone, Elkhorn Ridge Argillite is intensely brecciated up to 2-3 km from the subterrane contact. A suite of undeformed diorite, quartz diorite, and tonalite of the Gold Bug pluton intrudes this fault zone, indicating that major brittle deformation ended prior to the emplacement of this plutonic sequence. U-Pb zircon ages from the Gold Bug pluton coupled with Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic data from metasedimentary rocks, provide an important timing constraint on the juxtaposition of the subterranes.

CONSTRAINTS ON SPREADING RATES, COOLING AND FAULTING HISTORIES, AND MODES OF CRUSTAL ACCRETION|Barbara JOHN, Michael CHEADLE, Graham BAINES, Craig GRIMES, Joshua SCHWARTZ, Joe WOODEN|2007/10/31|2007 GSA Denver Annual Meeting|||||The recognition of igneous zircon in evolved gabbroic rocks (including Fe-Ti oxide and/or amphibole-bearing gabbro, quartz diorite, and tonalite) that comprise a significant portion of oceanic crust exposed at slow and ultraslow spreading mid-ocean ridges, provides an unprecedented opportunity for U/Pb zircon SHRIMP II dating. U/Pb ages, with a resolution of~ 2-3%(as low as 0.02-0.03 my in 1 Ma crust), provide detailed information on spreading rates, help calibrate marine magnetic anomalies, provide detailed constraints on the timing of both magmatism and denudation, and contribute to knowledge of the rates and duration of crustal growth in slow spreading environments. Further, when used in conjunction with other thermochronometers, the full crustal cooling history can be determined. To date, our work has focused on the footwalls to large-slip faults at several sites including Atlantis Bank and ODP Hole 735B (SW Indian Ridge), ODP Holes 1270D and 1275D along the 15 20'fracture zone, the Kane Megamullion at 23 N and IODP Hole 1309D at 30 N, all on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We have determined plate spreading rates at Atlantis Bank and the Kane Megamullion that suggest that oceanic detachment faults form during periods of highly asymmetric spreading (Atlantis Bank detachment fault accommodated roughly 80% of plate spreading). We note that the average 206 Pb/238 U age is~ 0.2 my older than the estimated magnetic age of Hole 735B, implying that magnetic remanence was acquired~ 3 km off-axis, and crustal cooling rates of> 1000 C/myr from 850-550 C.

Schwartz Joshua|Growth and deformation of oceanic lithosphere: Case studies from Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge, and the Baker terrane, northeastern Oregon|Joshua J Schwartz|2007||||||This dissertation consists of two case studies which examine processes of oceanic crustal growth and deformational in two separate environments and at two different stages along the plate tectonic cycle. The first part investigates processes of crustal growth and tectonic denudation in slow-spreading oceanic crust. We use U-Pb zircon geochronology to date the timing of lower crustal accretion, and (U-Th)/He zircon thermochronology to constrain timescales and rates of cooling and hydrothermal fluid flow at the Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge. Geochronologic results indicate that∼ 75% of zircon ages agree with their predicted magnetic ages, whereas up to 25% are statistically older than predicted. We argue that these older components originally crystallized at depths of∼ 5-18 km in the axial lithosphere and were subsequently uplifted and intruded by shallow-level magmas during the creation of Atlantis …

Its presence in these rocks provides an exceptional opportunity to document crustal growth processes at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. We present nineteen Pb/U zircon SHRIMP-RG ion probe ages of lower crustal rocks collected by manned submersible, ROV, dredging and ODP drilling from a 20 x 30 km2 area of Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge, which allow us to constrain the growth and construction of oceanic crust.

Our recent investigations show zircon to be common in slow and ultraslow spreading oceanic crust including several locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR), and in rock types ranging from trondjhemite dikes to peridotite. Zircon is typically found in felsic intrusions and oxide gabbro, and in many cases may be due to late stage saturation in small pockets of residual melt. We report the morphologic and chemical characteristics of zircon grains collected from> 100 rock samples recovered both from the seafloor by manned submersible and ROV, and with depth by ODP/IODP drilling. Grains range from euhedral and faceted to anhedral and fractured, with internal zonation that may be …

Schwartz Joshua|Thermal History of an Oceanic Core Complex, Atlantis Bank, Southwest Indian Ridge: Evidence for Hydrothermal Activity 2.6 Myr Off-Axis|JJ Schwartz, BE John, MJ Cheadle, PW Reiners, G Baines|2004/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||We report 26 new (U-Th)/He zircon dates from the Atlantis Bank Oceanic Core Complex (OCC), Southwest Indian Ridge. The low (~ 200 C) closure temperature of the (U-Th)/He isotopic system, together with higher temperature (850 C) crystallization ages from U-Pb zircon dating, allow us to constrain the timescales and rates of lower crustal cooling in oceanic crust. Samples from the detachment fault surface exposed at the sea floor, indicate that the denuded crust cooled rapidly through 200 C in< 1 Myr, yielding mean cooling rates> 1200 C/Myr, consistent with existing models for cooling of oceanic crust. However, samples collected along post-detachment, NS-and EW-trending fault scarps record (U-Th)/He ages averaging 2.6 Myr younger than their corresponding igneous crystallization ages. These ages are inconsistent with steady-state conductive cooling models for lower oceanic crust and cannot be explained … 
Schwartz Joshua|PROVENANCE OF A LATE PROTEROZOIC-EARLY CAMBRIAN BASIN, SIERRAS DE CÓRDOBA, ARGENTINA: DETRITUS FROM GONDWANA OR LAURENTIA?|Joshua SCHWARTZ|2001/11/7|GSA Annual Meeting, November 5-8, 2001|||||Detrital metasediments of Cambrian or older age are the oldest rocks of the Pampean orogen in the Sierras de Córdoba. Previous studies have suggested that these pelitic to psammitic sediments were deposited marginal to the Rio de La Plata craton, but considerable uncertainty surrounds this assumption due to the fact that no Precambrian basement rocks are exposed in or near the Sierras de Córdoba or other Pampean ranges. Moreover, the strong tectonic and metamorphic overprints associated with the Pampean orogeny leave open the possibility that these rocks had a more exotic origin and were accreted during later tectonic events. We determined the ages of detrital zircons from the Sierras de Córdoba in order to gain insight into their provenance. The results indicate dominant zircon populations of Neoproterozoic (~ 600-700 Ma) and Middle Proterozoic (950-1050 Ma) age, and a limited presence of Paleoproterozoic (~ 1900 Ma) zircon. We interpret the sources of the Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic zircons to be Gondwanan, most probably derived from adjacent South America. The large Middle Proterozoic population, constituting more than half the analyzed grains, is more equivocal in origin. They could be derived from~ 1.0 Ga rocks exposed in the Sunsas belt on the western margin of the Amazon craton and/or its rifted equivalents (eg, Arequipa massif), or from the similarly aged Grenville province in Laurentia or its rifted equivalents (eg, the Argentine Precordillera). The Pb isotopic composition of feldspars from Córdoba gneisses were determined to distinguish between these possibilities, as Gondwanan and Laurentian …

Schwartz Joshua|Beth A. Berkowitz Defining Jewish Difference: From Antiquity to the Present|Joshua Schwartz|||||||Beth Berkowitz came upon a passage dealing with the rabbinic execution method of decapitation (t. Sanhedrin 9: 11). In this passage the second-century sage Rabbi Judah states that the preferred rabbinic means for decapitation was an axe despite its being more gruesome than decapitation by a sword. The axe was preferred because the sword was the Roman means of decapitation, and using it would be a transgression of the rabbinic prohibition against “their (= non-Jews’) laws” based on Lev 18: 3:“and in their laws you should not go.” Rabbi Judah’s use of the verse for issues of execution did not necessarily follow from the plain meaning of the verse:“Like the practice of the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you, you should not practice, and in their laws you should not go,” which is part of a general catalog of incest and other sex taboos. What could this have to do with a Roman means of execution? The author “wondered how often this verse had been read in this way, as a directive to Israel to turn itself into an ‘upside-down people’… and at what cost to Israel’s moral integrity.” The verse, the subsequent question, and sundry answers became the author’s study on “Jewish difference,” the topic of the present book. 
Schwartz Joshua|Zvi Ben-Dor Benite The Ten Lost Tribes: A World History|Joshua Schwartz|||||||Are the ten lost tribes of Israel, conquered by the Assyrians in the eighth century BCE and subsequently exiled into Assyria and beyond, still lost? It depends on whom you ask. According to a restaurant review from 10 September 2000 (http://www. nytimes. com/2000/09/10/nyregion/ventures-food-of-central-asia-from-the-lost-tribes. html), one descendant from these tribes, hailing from Uzbekistan in central Asia, might be found running the glatt kosher Bukharan Gan-Eden restaurant on West 47th street in New York City serving up a host of glatt kosher delicacies, perhaps reflecting recovered memories of the ten-lost-tribes cuisine. Some have thought that the Jews of Georgia or Azerbaijan might be descendants of the lost tribes, but they might just as easily hail from the somewhat later time of the Babylonian exile of the sixth century BCE. Other candidates for membership in the losttribes fellowship, and particularly from the tribe of Dan, are the Beta Israel of Ethiopia. The Bene Israel community of India is said by some to descend from Zebulon, although they prefer to be seen as descendants of the nonlost tribe of Judah, and sometimes the Jews of Cochin were considered descendants of the lost tribes, although they themselves claim that they were neither lost nor descendants of the ten tribes. 
Schwartz Joshua|Susan Marks First Came Marriage: The Rabbinic Appropriation of Early Jewish Wedding Ritual|Joshua Schwartz|||||||“By three means is the woman acquired and by two means she acquires her freedom. She is acquired by money or by writ or by intercourse”(m. Qiddushin 1: 1). This is seemingly the basis for the “ritual” act of qiddushin, or betrothal in Jewish law, in which the future bride is acquired by one of these methods. Is the woman really being bought, or is the acquisition symbolic? Some have said that what the future husband is getting in the deal is her sexuality, her monogamy, and it is more perhaps “sanctification”(from holiness, qedushah) than a business deal. From ancient until modern times, attempts have been made within almost all possible frameworks and variations of Jewish law to make all this more palatable, whether by playing down the acquisition aspect or by adding reciprocity to the acquisition (see http://alternativestokiddushin. wordpress. com/; http://www. haaretz. co. il/. premium-1.2074586). Susan Marks, however, chooses not to rehash the sociolegal aspects of all this but rather to try and uncover the wedding ritual of the early rabbis, and the tradition above, as well as others, is one of the traditions that will help her uncover aspects and practices of Jewish weddings that have not been noticed before. Marks’s quest, however, has built-in obstacles that require her to develop a new methodology. While ritual is ahistorical, trying to pinpoint and develop the understanding of ritual in the past requires a historical framework. The two opposing forces pull in different directions. Marks decides to embrace the paradox of ritual within history and 
Schwartz Joshua|Haircut and Barber in Ancient Jewish Society|Joshua Schwartz|||||||Hair grows almost everywhere on the human body. Sometimes this hair is left to grow unhindered. Other times it might be styled, cut, trimmed, or shaven. There are often differences between men and women, children and adults as to what to do with hair, how to style it, care for it, or remove it. Sometimes normative treatment is determined by cultural norms or by religious practice or rules which might or might not have symbolic meaning far beyond anything to do with hair. There are also usually some allowances for personal preferences re the treatment in general of one’s hair, making hair often a pronounced marker of one’s individuality (Sherrow 2006; Biddle-Perry and Cheang 2008; Eilberg-Schwartz 1995: 85; Synott 1987: 381–413; Leach 1957: 147–168). 1 Judaism was no exception to any of the above and it had its hair rules, styles, and norms. To cite one famous rule, the Bible forbade the marring of the corners of the beard (Lev 19: 27). This was interpreted by the Rabbis as shaving with a (razor) blade against the skin and the five points of the beard (Bavli Makkot 20 a–b), although there were differences of opinion as to what these points were. Eventually, shaving the entire beard and mustache with a blade was prohibited (Wiener 19782; Gross 19802). There were also restrictions at times on certain types of hairstyles and on certain haircuts. These restrictions were based on rabbinic prohibitions against growing the fringe (tẓiẓit) or cutting the hair komê (Sifra, Aḥare Mot 13: 9, Tosefta Shabbat 6: 1, Deuteronomy Rabbah [ed. Vilna] 2: 18)(Berkowitz 2009: 145–151; Hayes 1997: 84–90, 221–223). 
Schwartz Joshua|Jenny R. Labendz Socratic Torah: Non-Jews in Rabbinic Intellectual Culture|Joshua Schwartz|||||||The study of the history of the Mishnah and Talmud period is extremely difficult. A major problem is that a good part of that history is dependent upon the Mishnah and Talmud, or rabbinic literature in general, and every couple of years academic fashion changes in respect to these disciplines. Many of the old methodologies and the subsequent conclusions are relegated almost completely to the academic dust bin. Theoretically this might be seen as a good thing. Unfortunately, however, very often the methodologies do not build one on another but sweep away the old ones and their conclusions. These methodologies and conclusions are not salvageable and cannot be readjusted or fine-tuned. Foundations crumble and new foundations are built, a process that is repeated every so often. As a graduate student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the 1970s, having come from an institution in the US stressing a traditional-religious (fundamentalist) approach to the history that one could learn from rabbinic literature, I was greatly impressed by the “new” approach, new for me at least, of the “Jerusalem school,” which sought the historical kernel hidden somewhere in the rabbinic teaching or sugya. During the course of time I learned that this approach was not so new and that there were already new voices and methodologies being developed in the US that I had left, but that was of

We investigated these parameters from 260 K to 110 K using a walk-in freezer, and chilling by dry ice and liquid nitrogen. We also investigated the influence of solid impurity concentration and the spread in crystal grain size distribution. Although fracture toughness showed no sensitivity to temperature, we find that tensile strength increases with decreasing temperature at 7 kPa K− 1 for all ice types tested. For pure water ice, samples made from uniform-sized seed crystals were stronger than mixed-grain-size ice, suggesting that strength is limited by the coarse tail of the size distribution. Samples tested submerged in liquid … 
Miller Kimberly|Quantifying the significance of abrasion and selective transport for downstream fluvial grain size evolution|Kimberly Litwin Miller, Timea Szabo, Douglas Jerolmack, Gabor Domokos|2014|Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface||||Wiley|It is well known that pebble diameter systematically decreases downstream in rivers. The contribution of abrasion is uncertain, in part because (1) diameter is insufficient to characterize pebble mass loss due to abrasion and (2) abrasion rates measured in laboratory experiments cannot be easily extrapolated to the field. A recent geometric theory describes abrasion as a curvature‐dependent process that produces a two‐phase evolution: in Phase I, initially blocky pebbles round to smooth, convex shapes with little reduction in axis dimensions; then, in Phase II, smooth, convex pebbles slowly reduce their axis dimensions. Here we provide strong evidence that two‐phase abrasion occurs in a natural setting, by examining downstream evolution of shape and size of thousands of pebbles over~ 10 km in a tropical montane stream. The geometric theory is verified in this river system using a variety of manual and image …

Millions of dollars have been invested in building and renovating flume laboratories that run experiments at increasing sophistication, scale, and resolution. However, this overflowing body of laboratory data is not easily analyzed, stored, or accessed. This lack of organization comes at substantial cost to the Earth-surface science community (i.e., geomorphologists, sedimentary geologists, and engineers) through missed opportunities to address scientific challenges. Here, we present an overview of the current state of data management practices and challenges within the context of the experimental lifecycle. Based on this assessment, we identify four areas of greatest need in order to achieve higher rates of data sharing and reuse: metadata guidelines, workflow documentation, data storage, and …

In this paper we investigate non-intrusive polynomial chaos for uncertainty quantification, which in contrast to random sampling methods (e.g., LHS and MCS), represents a model response of interest as a weighted sum of polynomials over the random inputs. Once a chaos expansion has been constructed, approximating the mean, covariance, probability … 
Miller Kimberly|Erodibility of Titan ice bedrock constrained by laboratory measurements of ice strength and erosion by sediment impacts|LS Sklar, GC Collins, KL Litwin, PJ Polito, BR Zygielbaum|2012/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Saturn's moon Titan has a remarkably earth-like surface morphology, with branching fluvial networks draining elevated terrain. A paucity of impact craters suggests fluvial dissection is active and that the pace of landscape evolution is rapid. A key limitation on modeling rates of incision by Titan's rivers of liquid methane has been a lack of information on the erodibility of water-ice bedrock at ultra-cold temperatures. Here we report results from laboratory measurements of ice resistance to tensile fracture and rates of erosion of Titan bedrock analogs by low-velocity sediment impacts. We apply these experimental results to modeling fluvial incision, and explore constraints on rates and frequency of channel cutting on Titan. We made test samples of polycrystalline ice with a narrow and wide size distribution of seed ice grains. For some samples we added solid impurities composed of basalt, urea, and ammonium-sulfate … 
Miller Kimberly|Do Titan's river channels carve into ice bedrock or loose regolith?|GC Collins, LS Sklar, KL Litwin, PJ Polito|2012/4||||30||Final results from our experiments investigating the abrasion resistance and strength of polycrystalline ice and ice/contaminant mixtures at Titan temperatures allow us to update the calculations of Collins (2005), which examined the ease of fluvial incision into ice bedrock on Titan. If Titan's stream channels run over exposed bedrock, the rate of channel downcutting is limited by the supply of sediment particles to abrade the bedrock surface, or by the production of pluckable blocks from joints in the bedrock. By adapting the equations of Sklar and Dietrich (2004) to Titan, we estimate the relative rate of bedrock incision caused by abrasion of sediment particles, and find that bedrock on Titan responds like a welded tuff or a quartzite on Earth, rather than the weak sandstone-like response found initially by Collins (2005). 
Miller Kimberly|Experimental investigation of the temperature dependence of polycrystalline ice strength and resistance to low-velocity impacts with application to Titan|PJ Polito, K Litwin, BR Zygielbaum, LS Sklar, GC Collins|2009/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Images from Cassini and Huygens reveal widespread fluvial dissection of Titan's surface, where incision by low-velocity impacts of bedload sediments may be a dominant mechanism, much like fluvial systems on Earth. Models of fluvial erosion dynamics on Titan are currently limited by a lack of data on ice resistance to abrasive wear at ultra-low temperatures. Using the theoretical framework of a terrestrial bedrock incision model, we seek to quantify the temperature dependence of the abrasion resistance of ice. We use the saltation-abrasion model to calculate a non-dimensional abrasion resistance coefficient, kv= 2εvE/sigmat2, where εv is the impact kinetic energy to detach a unit volume of material, E is the elastic modulus, and sigmat is the tensile strength. Here we present results of a laboratory investigation of the tensile strength and erodibility of polycrystalline water-ice at temperatures ranging from 270 K … 
Miller Kimberly|Island formation resulting from radially symmetric flow expansion|John B Shaw, Kimberly Miller, Brandon McElroy|2018/2/1|Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|123|2|363-383||Island formation and distributary channel branching are important processes in prograding river deltas. We develop and test a new theory predicting the distance to islands and channel bifurcations based on fluid mass conservation and radially symmetric transport conditions. We analyze channelization and island formation using nine new and five existing delta experiments as well as four field deltas. The new experiments were designed to produce islands from initial deposition of a mouth bar. Before island formation, each bar evolved into a radially symmetric deposit with unchannelized flow over its top previously described as a topographic flow expansion. This morphology was stable to topographic perturbations, and its distal limit prograded basinward while maintaining a characteristic flow depth. Island formation and channel branching occurred on top of this deposit. We hypothesize that this distance (Ψ) is set …

Miller Kimberly|Laboratory investigation on effects of flood intermittency on river delta dynamics|KL Miller, W Kim|2015/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||In order to simplify the complex hydrological variability of flow conditions, experiments modeling delta evolution are often conducted using a representative" channel-forming" flood flow and then relate results to field settings using an intermittency factor, defined as the fraction of total time at flood conditions. Although this intermittency factor makes it easier to investigate how variables, such as relative base level and/or sediment supply, affect delta dynamics, little is known about how this generalization to a single flow condition affects delta processes. We conducted a set of laboratory experiments with periodic flow conditions to determine the effects of intermittent discharges on delta evolution. During the experiment, flood with a set water discharge and sediment supply, cycles between periods of normal flow where the water flux is halved and the sediment discharge is turned off. For each run, the magnitude of the … 
Miller Kimberly|Laboratory experiments for defining scaling relations between rock material properties and rock resistance to erosion|LS Sklar, JD Beyeler, GC Collins, JW Farrow, L Hsu, KL Litwin, PJ Polito|2012/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Rock resistance to erosion is a key variable that limits rates of morphologic change and mass flux in landscapes. However, we have limited knowledge of how measurable material properties influence rock resistance to specific erosion processes. Rock'erodibility'is commonly a free parameter in surface process models, where users assign or solve for numerical values that lack meaning outside of the model. Moreover, erodibility parameters often lump material resistance to erosion together with aspects of the forces driving erosion that are not explicitly represented in the model. Laboratory experiments in which rock types are varied, while erosive forces are held constant, can be used to develop scaling relationships between rock properties and erosion resistance for individual detachment mechanisms. With knowledge of why erosion rates vary between rock types for constant erosive forces, laboratory and field … 
Miller Kimberly|The influence of impurities in Titan ice bedrock on tensile strength and resistance to fluvial erosion: experimental results|KL Litwin, P Polito, B Zygielbaum, LS Sklar, GC Collins|2010/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Images of the surface of Titan returned by the Cassini-Huygens mission show extensive fluvial drainage networks, which may be eroded by low-velocity impacts by ice clasts moving as bedload in rivers of liquid methane. Recent work has shown that the strength of polycrystalline water ice at Titan surface temperature of 93K is comparable to moderate strength rocks on Earth, and is significantly stronger than ice at terrestrial temperatures. However, the ice bedrock on Titan is likely to contain impurities such as silicates, atmospherically-derived hydrocarbon polymers and compounds of cryovolcanic origin. In this laboratory investigation, we examine the dependence of ice erosion resistance on the concentration of impurities, across a wide range of temperatures. The polycrystalline ice is made from a log-normally distributed seed crystal material with a median size of 1.4 mm, which we combine with particles of basalt … 
Miller Kimberly|Laboratory investigation on effects of flood intermittency on fan delta dynamics|KL Miller, W Kim, B McElroy|2019/1/7|Journal Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|124|||Wiley|To simplify the complex hydrological variability of flow conditions, experiments on delta evolution are often conducted using a representative channel‐forming flood flow and results are related to field settings using an intermittency factor, defined as the fraction of time in flood. Although this factor provides an approximation of dominant flow conditions and makes modeling deltas easier by turning their complex hydraulics into a single representative value, little is known about how this generalization affects delta processes. We conducted experiments with periodic flow conditions to determine the effects of intermittent discharges on fan deltas. For each run, the magnitude of floods was held constant, but the duration changed, thus varying the intermittency factor, between 1 and 0.2. Floods consisted of higher water and sediment discharge, while base flow periods had lower water discharge and sediment input ceased …

Miller Kimberly|Investigating fluvial pattern and delta-planform geometry based on varying intervals of flood and interflood|Jacqueline E Rambo, W Kim, K Miller|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Physical modeling of a delta's evolution can represent how changing the intervals of flood and interflood can alter a delta's fluvial pattern and geometry. Here we present a set of six experimental runs in which sediment and water were discharged at constant rates over each experiment. During the" flood" period, both sediment and water were discharged at rates of 0.25 cm3/s and 15 ml/s respectively, and during the" interflood" period, only water was discharged at 7.5 ml/s. The flood periods were only run for 30 minutes to keep the total volume of sediment constant. Run 0 did not have an interflood period and therefore ran with constant sediment and water discharge for the duration of the experiment. The other five runs had either 5, 10, or 15-min intervals of flood with 5, 10, or 15-min intervals of interflood. The experimental results show that Run 0 had the smallest topset area. This is due to a lack of surface reworking … 
Miller Kimberly|Sand transport, shear stress, and the building of a delta|Wayne Wagner, KL Miller, MR Hiatt, DC Mohrig|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||River deltas distribute sediment to the coastal sea through a complex branching network of channels; however, the routing and storage of this sediment in and through the delta is poorly understood. We present results from field studies of the sediment and water transport through the branching Wax Lake Delta on the coast of Louisiana. Two channels studied, Main Pass and East Pass, maintain a near-equal total partitioning of flow and sediment. However, East Pass is narrower and has higher river velocities, lower tidal velocity fluctuations, less alluvial bed cover, and more sediment flux per unit width than Main Pass. We connect these differences to small differences in the geometry of the two channels and feedbacks between these differences. We link trends in measured sediment deposits to both measured and modeled shear velocities in Wax Lake Delta's channels and open waterislands' to understand how … 
Miller Kimberly|Quantifying variability in delta experiments|Kimberly Litwin Miller, SR Berg, BJ McElroy|2017/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Large populations of people and wildlife make their homes on river deltas, therefore it is important to be able to make useful and accurate predictions of how these landforms will change over time. However, making predictions can be a challenge due to inherent variability of the natural system. Furthermore, when we extrapolate results from the laboratory to the field setting, we bring with it random and systematic errors of the experiment. We seek to understand both the intrinsic and experimental variability of river delta systems to help better inform predictions of how these landforms will evolve. We run exact replicates of experiments with steady sediment and water discharge and record delta evolution with overhead time lapse imaging. We measure aspects of topset progradation and channel dynamics and compare these metrics of delta morphology between the 6 replicated experimental runs. We also use data … 
Miller Kimberly|Variance in Dominant Grain Size Across the Mississippi River Delta|KL Miller, EL Chamberlain, CR Esposito, RW Wagner, DC Mohrig|2016/2||||||Proposals to restore coastal Louisiana often center on Mississippi River diversion projects wherein water and sediment are routed into wetlands and shallow waters in an effort to build land. Successful design and implementation of diversions will include consideration of behavior and characteristics of sediment, both in the river and in the receiving basin. The Mississippi River sediment load is primarily mud (roughly 75%), with the remainder being very-fine to medium sand or organic detritus. The dominance of muds leads many to suggest that diversions should focus on capturing the mud fraction despite the smaller size and longer settling times required for these particles compared to sand; others believe that sand should be the focus. We present a systemic analysis of the texture of land-building sediment in the Mississippi Delta using borehole data from various depositional environments representing a range of … 
Miller Kimberly|A mass-conservation-based approach to predicting river mouth channel bifurcations|J Shaw, BJ McElroy, KL Miller|2015/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Channel bifurcation is an important process in fluvio-deltaic morphodynamics and resulting stratigraphic architecture of prograding river deltas. We develop and test a new theory for the formation of channel bifurcations based on fluid mass conservation and system-averaged transport conditions rather than local hydrodynamics. We built 29 experimental deltas under a variety of boundary conditions to examine the inception and growth of bars and channel bifurcations. From the initial condition of water and sediment entering a still basin of uniform depth as a wall-bounded turbulent jet, delta growth begins with the formation of a lunate bar as predicted by the hydrodynamics of jet spreading. However, the lunate bar diverts water and sediment laterally causing the bar to widen into a radially symmetric sediment" apron" extending uniformly from the channel axis to the flume walls. This apron is stable to perturbations … 
Miller Kimberly|Generalized sorting profile of alluvial fans|DJ Jerolmack, KL Miller|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Alluvial rivers often exhibit self-similar gravel size distributions and abrupt gravel-sand transitions. Laboratory experiments suggest these sorting patterns are established rapidly, but how-and how fast-this convergence occurs in the field is unknown. Here we examine the establishment of downstream sorting patterns and channel geometry in a km-scale alluvial fan. The sharp transition from a canyon to an unconfined, channelized fan provides a well-defined boundary condition and also a strong discontinuity. The channel changes from deep and entrenched at the fan apex to shallow and depositional over a short distance, exhibiting non-equilibrium behavior. The resulting gravel fining profile is not self-similar; the particle size distribution narrows until approximate equal mobility is achieved. Further downfan, the gravel-sand transition appears to exhibit a self-similar form; field data collapse with laboratory … 
Miller Kimberly|Mechanics, kinematics and geometry of pebble abrasion from binary collisions|KL Miller, DJ Jerolmack|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||As sediment is transported downstream as bedload, it collides with the bed causing sharp edges to chip and wear away, rounding the rock through the process of abrasion. Previous work has linked abrasion to downstream fining and rounding of grains, however, there has been little attempt to understand the underlying kinematics of abrasion. Furthermore, most studies neglect the fine particle produced during the abrasion process, as the initial grain gets smaller and rounder. In this research, we preform well-controlled laboratory experiments to determine the functional dependence between impact energy and mass lost from abrasion. We use a double-pendulum" Newton's Cradle" set-up to examine the abrasion between two grains and with a high-speed camera, we can quantify the impact energies during collision. Results from experiments verify that mass loss is proportional to kinetic energy. We define a …

While some authors have emphasized sorting by size-selective transport as the dominant fining mechanism in various rivers, others demonstrated the effectiveness of abrasion in certain fluvial systems. We present a synthetic grain-scale model in which we combine a recently developed geometric abrasion model (the so-called'box equations'[1]) with a simplistic selective deposition rule. Box equations are capable to describe the evolution of both the shape and the size of the particles during abrasion, as opposed to previous models which only dealt with the size (or alternatively, the mass) diminution. We adapt our synthetic model to numerically simulate the downstream grain size and shape evolution in a short tropical river in Puerto Rico where we conducted … 
Miller Kimberly|Two-Phase Abrasion in Eolian Transport of Gypsum Sand, White Sands NM|S Shaw, DJ Jerolmack, KL Miller|2014/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Downstream rounding of grains is consistently observed in natural sediment transport settings. A recent theory put forth by Domokos et al.(2014) attributes particle rounding and size reduction to a geometric curvature-driven abrasion process. This process occurs in two phases, in which irregularly shaped or angular particles round to convex shapes with negligible change in axis dimension, then slowly reduce in particle diameter. Miller et al (in review) establish the existence of two-phase abrasion in the natural setting of a fluvial gravel stream. This study examines field samples from White Sands, NM to investigate the presence of two-phase abrasion in a different, non-idealized natural environment-a high-energy, eolian gypsum dunefield. Analysis of grain shapes from White Sands confirms the two-phase abrasion process, dependent upon mode of sediment transport. We find that large sand grains carried in … 
Miller Kimberly|The causes and consequences of particle size change in fluvial systems|Kimberly Louise Litwin Miller|2014||||||One of the most common features in fluvial environments is the systematic downstream decline in grain size, which is usually attributed to either abrasion-the reduction in sediment size due to attrition of mass-or selective sorting-the size segregation of grains due to their relative transport mobility. Despite the ubiquity of this grain pattern and the extensive research on both of these processes, there remains questions regarding the underlying principles driving abrasion and sorting, as well as the relative contribution of these processes to grain fining. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of these processes is necessary to observe their direct effect on pattern formation. This dissertation investigates the controls and limits on abrasion and sorting through field studies and laboratory experiments. First, using the well-defined boundary conditions of an alluvial fan, we examine how grain hiding limits gravel sorting by tracking changes in the grain size distribution measured using a novel image-based technique. Further downfan, we compare surface sand fractions measured in the field with those from the lab and show that the gravel-sand sorting profiles are self-similar, suggesting generality in their development. In a second field study, using detailed hand and image-based measurements characterizing size and shape of thousands of grains throughout a watershed, we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of abrasion. We then input these measurements into a simple numerical model to tease apart the contribution of abrasion and sorting to downstream grains size and shape evolution. Finally, we conduct laboratory experiments to isolate the … 
Miller Kimberly|Field evidence of two-phase abrasion process|KL Miller, T Szabo, DJ Jerolmack, G Domokos|2013/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The rounded shape of river rocks is clear evidence that abrasion due to bed load transport is a significant agent for mass loss. Its contribution to downstream fining, however, is typically assumed to be negligible-as diminution trends may be explained solely by size-selective transport. A recent theory has predicted that pebble abrasion occurs in two well separated phases: in Phase 1, an intially-polyhedral pebble rounds to the shape of an inscribed ellipsoid without any change in axis dimensions; in Phase II, axis dimensions are slowly reduced. Importantly, Phase I abrasion means that an initially-blocky pebble may lose up to half its mass without any apparent change in'size', which is only measured as the length of a single pebble axis by most field researchers. We hypothesize that field studies have significantly underestimated the importance of abrasion because they do not quantify pebble shape, and we set out … 
Miller Kimberly|Universal scaling relations for pebble abrasion|KL Litwin, DJ Jerolmack|2012/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||The process of abrasion of gravel in bed load transport results from particle-to-particle collisions, where the energy involved is sufficient to cause chipping and spallation but not fragmentation of parent grains. The removed rock material is not infinitesimal; daughter products as large as coarse sand can be produced. Although previous work has shown that lithology, grain shape, and energy of collision are contributing factors that control abrasion rates of river-bed material, little is known regarding the relationship between these factors and diminution rates. Here we explicitly isolate and investigate how these three factors influence rates of abrasion and the size distribution of daughter products, with laboratory experiments. The apparatus is a double pendulum (Newton's cradle) that produces well-controlled binary collisions. A high-speed camera precisely measures collision energy, while mass of parent rocks. and … 
Miller Kimberly|First-order control of surface roughness at three scales: boundary layer dynamics, tracer dispersion and pebble abrasion|DJ Jerolmack, KL Litwin, CB Phillips, RL Martin|2012/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||In many situations it may be appropriate to treat surfaces as smooth and particles as spherical, however here we focus on scenarios in which the roughness of the surface exerts a first-order control on flow and transport dynamics. We describe three vignettes at three different scales:(1) roughness transitions and resulting sediment transport dynamics over~ 10-km distance in a desert dune field;(2) reach-scale river bed roughness and its influence on dispersion of tracer particles in bed load; and (3) the control of particle surface roughness on the nature and rate of pebble abrasion. For (1), we show how the abrupt transition from a flat surface to a dune field may be treated as a step increase in the aerodynamic roughness parameter-so long as the spatial scale considered is significantly larger than that of an individual dune. This increase causes a spatial decline in the boundary stress downwind that may be … 
Miller Kimberly|Investigating selective transport and abrasion on an alluvial fan using quantitative grain size and shape analysis|KL Litwin, DJ Jerolmack|2011/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Selective sorting and abrasion are the two major fluvial processes that are attributed to the downstream fining of sediments in rivers and alluvial fans. Selective transport is the process by which smaller grains are preferentially transported downstream while larger grains are deposited closer to the source. Abrasion is defined by the production of fine sediments and sand that occurs by saltation of gravel, where particle-to-particle collisions supply the energy required to break apart grains. We hypothesize that abrasion results in the gradual fining of large grains and the production of fine sands and silts, while sorting accounts for the differences in transport of these two grain-size fractions produced from abrasion, thereby creating the abrupt gravel-sand transition observed in many channel systems. In this research, we explore both selective transport and abrasion processes on the Dog Canyon alluvial fan near …

Miller Kimberly|The dependence of bedrock erodibility on rock material properties: is tensile strength enough?|JD Beyeler, LS Sklar, K Litwin, JP Johnson, GC Collins, KX Whipple|2009/12|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|||||Rock resistance to fluvial abrasion by bedload sediment impacts has been shown experimentally to depend on the square of rock tensile strength across the full range of rock strengths encountered in the field. This result is consistent with fracture mechanics theory which predicts that fractures propagate when the capacity of brittle materials to store impact energy by elastic deformation is exceeded. Strain energy depends on the square of tensile strength, but also on the elastic modulus. Log-log linear regression of laboratory measurements of bedrock erosion rates against tensile strength shows order-of-magnitude variability about the power-law fit, particularly for stronger rocks. In this investigation we seek to explain this variability in terms of other rock material properties. In particular we are examining elastic modulus, crystal grain size, mineralogy, degree of cementation, rock bulk density and porosity. We have …

Recent measurements of the effect of temperature on the tensile strength of low-porosity, polycrystalline ice, without impurities, suggest that ice bedrock at the Titan surface temperature of 93 K may be as much as five times stronger than ice at terrestrial surface temperatures. However, ice bedrock on Titan and other outer solar system bodies may have significant porosity, and impurities such silicates or polymers are possible in such ices. In this laboratory investigation we are exploring the dependence of tensile strength on the density and concentration of impurities, for polycrystalline ice across a wide range of temperatures.

Joseph Galasso|Interference in second language acquisition: A review of the fundamental difference hypothesis|Joseph Galasso|2002|Northridge: California State University|||||We assume that Universal Grammar (UG) constrains the specific formulation of the entire range of all possible grammatical constructions for human language. In the broadest sense, the proposal that invariant universal principles (i) make-up UG, and (ii) pertain to all languages is tantamount to saying that UG renders all languages identical. More specifically, the way in which a child goes about acquiring his/her first language (a UG variant) is then said to amount to little more than what is referred to in the First Child Language Acquisition literature as the adjusting of the Parameter Settings which overlay these inherent Principles in accordance to Chomsky’s Principles and Parameters Theory (PPT)(Chomsky 1986, 1995). The question raised in this paper is to what extent does the first language’s (L1) already set parameterization transfer and potentially interfere with the learning processes of a post-criticalperiod second language (L2). The L2 data are examined in light of the roles Case and Agreement play in Spanish as well as in English functional grammars—paying particular attention to ‘Pro-drop’. We conclude that L1 Spanish speakers learning English as an L2 initially go through a series of subconscious language-specific learning strategies that enable them to cope with a divergent English input. Although there may be cognitive employs behind such strategies, we believe that the learning mechanisms involved here work in a more tacit manner coinciding with a modularity theory. These strategies however do not support general claims often made that UG is in any way accessible to the L2 post-critical learner as a ‘cleanslate’, nor do we … 
Joseph Galasso|Children's possessive structures: a case study|Andrew Radford, Joseph Galasso|1998/4|Essex research reports in linguistics|19||37-45||Two-and three-year-old children generally go through a stage during which they sporadically omit possessive's, so alternating between saying (eg) Daddy’s car and Daddy car. At roughly the same age, children also go through a stage (referred to by Wexler 1994 as the optional infinitives stage) during which they sporadically omit the third person singular present tense+ s inflection on verbs, so alternating between eg Daddy wants one and Daddy want one. The question addressed in this paper is whether children's sporadic omission of possessive‘s is related to their sporadic omission of third person singular present tense s—and if so, how. This question is explored in relation to data provided by a longitudinal study conducted by Joseph Galasso of his son Nicolas between ages 2; 3 and 3; 6 (based on transcripts of weekly audio recordings of Nicolas’ speech production). Nicolas’ speech production provides some prima facie evidence of a relation between the acquisition of possessive‘s and the third person singular s: prior to age 3; 2, Nicolas used neither possessive‘s nor third person singular s in obligatory contexts; it is only from age 3; 2 on that we find both morphemes being used. The table in (1) below shows the relative frequency of use of possessive‘s and third person singular present tense s in obligatory contexts before and after age 3; 2: 
Joseph Galasso|The acquisition of functional categories|Joseph Galasso|2003|||||IULC Publications|This book is an extensive revision of my doctoral dissertation, submitted to the University of Essex in 1999. While the arguments presented herein are identical to those of the dissertation—namely arguments which lend themselves to more traditional theories concerning the nature of language development—many of the findings could be recast to contribute to the series of debates now being waged regarding the'Dual Mechanism Model'(see Clahsen 1999, Pinker 1999 for a review). For instance, attested disparities and development/chronological onsets between the morphological processing of (rote-learned) irregular versus (rule-based) regular verbs (evidenced in so-called'u-shaped learning') may likewise spill over and reflect the protracted development of more formal computational processes related to the emergence of functional categories (particularly the development of IP). Generally speaking, I believe the findings presented in this book add considerable support to the idea that children may indeed begin their very early stages of syntactic development much in the same way as they begin their phonological development—that is, initially, by primitive and robust means of establishing some type of first order associations linking'form'to'meaning', whether it be regarding, for example,(i) the treatment of syllabic whole chunks that the child processes in early word production/recognition (postponing a phonetic based segmental process to a second stage of development), or, as this study shows,(ii) the treatment of non-syntactic processing where formulaic chunks and or lexical redundancy rules are the order of the day (and likewise postponing … 
Joseph Galasso|Analyzing English grammar: An Introduction to feature theory|Joseph Galasso|2002|California State University, Northridge|||||
Joseph Galasso|The acquisition of functional categories: A case study|Joseph Galasso|1999||||||The case study argues in favor of an initial Pre-Functional stage in the acquisition of English syntax that arises as a result of the protracted'maturational-scheduling'of the functional category IP. This initial stage comes to be described as a Non-INFLectional stage-1 during which subject-agreement and possessor-agreement go unmarked. Following Radford & Galasso (1998), the data point to an interesting and previously unreported symmetry between the general development of inflective properties: viz., Subject-Verb constructions on the one hand and Possessive-Noun constructions on the other. Both show symmetric-chronological development of inflectional markings for 3Present/Sg/{s} and Possessive {'s}(respectively). 
Joseph Galasso|Analyzing English grammar: an introduction to feature theory: a companion handbook|Joseph Galasso|2011/4/26||||||The past few years have witnessed a shift in reasoning in how traditional grammar should be conceptualized. This shift, I believe, has done well to naturally aid students in achieving a higher and more comprehensive level of language. The aim of this companion handbook is to provide an elementary introduction to recent developments in syntactic theory--particularly working within the framework of Chomsky’s 1995 Minimalist Program. More specifically, the handbook focuses on a theory called Feature Theory, as it has to do with basic levels of grammar. Although Feature Theory is an integral part of Chomsky's overall theory stated within the Minimalist Program, there is nothing inherent in the theory itself which should prevent it from being presented along side, say, other textbooks on the topic of grammar which in fact may correlate to other syntactic theories. In other words, the principles behind Feature Theory as … 
Joseph Galasso|A working paper on second language acquisition research: Some notes on theory and method|Joseph Galasso|1999|Retrieved January|18||2005||From Skinner to Piaget. Much work in the 1950s among American Linguists sought to capture the nature of language and language acquisition either via Behaviorist Methods (Skinner’s Stimulus & Response), or via Cognitive Maturationalism (Piaget). Chomsky's early work in the late ‘50s initially focused on discrediting both schoolsof thought (as witnessed in the famous debates: Skinner vs. Chomsky (Chomsky 1959), and Chomsky vs. Piaget (PiattelliPalmarini: ed. 1980). Although it appears that Chomsky has been credited with the ‘win’between the two sides of the debates—clearly behaviorism in its purest form was destined to failure—it is a mistake to suggest that Chomsky has entirely closed the book on the debate between the two competing models: both models contain special and intrinsic aspects which do well to explain some elements of language. Having said this, Chomsky’s claim that the brain contains a separate module for language (viz., the language faculty), independent of cognition, certainly heralded an important breakthrough in how we understand the nature of language and language acquisition.

Joseph Galasso|The acquisition of inflection and the dual mechanism model: A case study|Joseph Galasso|2004|Proceedings of the 2004 Child Language Research Forum Stanford|||98-108||The study of syntactic development in children, for all intents and purposes, is reducible to a single minded inquiry into how the very young child (implicitly) knows to distinguish between lexical stems and functional affixes. Hence, the overriding question burning in the minds of most developmental linguists is morpho-phonological in nature. For instance, it would seem that the child must at least know (a priori) the stem before she can then engage in a dual-track process by which ambient separation of the morpho-phonological distinction attributive to past tense is carried out, say, between the paradigmatic representation of the English word play vs. play-ed/ple-d/(a dual processing which provokes separation of the/play/-stem and the/d/-affix). Otherwise, it could be conceivable for the young child that the pair play-played would represent altogether two different lexical stems, and, stored as such, reflect two distinct though relatively similar semantic notions (a single processing): perhaps not unlike what we do find regarding derived words where an otherwise'two-morpheme'analysis of [teach]-{er} is processed (tagged, stored and retrieved) as a'single-morpheme'stem [teacher], similar to how the word [brother] is stored.(See Clahsen et al. 2001).

We believe the findings provided in this study coincide with a maturational-based interpretation consistent with the Dual Mechanism Model, a processing model which seeks to distribute … 
Joseph Galasso|The development of child code-switching: Minimalist constraints and the role of checking theory|Joseph Galasso|2001|||||URL: http://www. csun. edu/~ galasso/code. htm|It has been reported in the literature that language mixing at the Pre-Functional (Non-INFL) VP-stage does not follow any syntactic constraints, whereas mixing at the later Function IP-stage does (cf., Vihman: 1984, Toribio: 1994, Meisel: 1989, 1990, 1994a, Köppe & Meisel: 1995). These researchers in general, have argued that syntactic constraints on code-switching simply do not apply at the early prefunctional stage-1 owing to the fact that the essential components of the lexical item (viz. those functional components relating to INFL which inherently bring about the parameterization of phrase-structure) have not yet been acquired. Addressing notions of underspecification of functional features this is tantamount to saying that if functional constraints on code-switching are somehow dependent upon the existence of functional features, then at a stage where functional categories are underspecified in respect to functional features, we should expect the relevant constraint to be inoperative.

Joseph Galasso|Minimum of English Grammar: An Introduction to Feature Theory: with a Special Note on the Nature of Early Child Grammars of English|Joseph Galasso|2009|||||University Readers|This handbook essentially delivers two books in one. On one hand, linguistic informed phenomena are presented to the reader in general terms topics related to Child Language Acquisition, Language Impairment, as well as the Brain-Language Corollary. On the other hand, the handbook presents as its fundamental core the kind of theoretical syntax that has come to be regarded amongst Chomskyan linguists. What Feature Theory Grammar allows us to do is essentially break down the components of traditional parts-of-speech words to a finer-grained analysis. This lets us tinker with certain sub-particles of the word in order to see how one isolated feature might project and contribute to a phrase over another. It is not too far of the mark then to suggest that Feature Theory is in fact a linguistics response to a Periodic Table of language.

Joseph Galasso|Non-count Noun Determiners: Where is the Feature?|Joseph Galasso|2001||||||This paper attempts to locate and account for a specific D-feature, shared only by a handful of (D) eterminers, which seems to allow for the modification of Non-count Nouns via a Spec/Head/Comp relationship within the DP. We examine evidence in connection with a class of Determiners that leads to the assumption that syntactic constraints may restrict some items to certain expression. In examining the role the Determiner plays in projecting Non-count Nominal expressions, we conclude by saying that one can no longer adhere to previously held notions of a pure category class of lexical items, particularly among the functional categories, and an effort is made toward applying a ‘finer-grained’analysis to the items themselves, placing a greater emphasis on inherent grammatico-semantic features internal to the lexical item itself. This approach coincides with recent work in Feature Theory as understood in Chomsky (1995).

Joseph Galasso|Synopsis of the Structure-building model of Andrew Radford (1990): And other maturational hypotheses leading to child development theories of the time1|Joseph Galasso|||||||Andrew Radford in his seminal 1990 monograph Syntactic Theory and the Acquisition of English Syntax summarizes the state of a Maturation hypothesis for child language acquisition. 2 Working within the Principles and Parameters framework (Chomsky 1988) as his point of departure, and drawing from previous work done by Borer and Wexler (1987) on the apparent absence of A-chains in early grammar, a Structure-building model was proposed which focused (inter alia) on the lack of syntactic movementoperations found in the early multi-word stage of child English syntax, viz., the lack of inflectional morphology. This lead to an analysis which saw children as gradually building up more and more complex structure, with lexical-categories (like noun, and verb), the so-called Lexical/thematic stage-1 being acquired before functional-categories (like determiner and complementiser), the so-called 
Joseph Galasso|A Recap: Structure-building models.|Joseph Galasso|||||||In terms of a merge-base theory of language acquisition, complements and specifiers are simply notations for first-merge (=" complement-of"[head-complement]), and later second-merge (=" specifier-of"[specifier-head], with merge always forming to a head. First-merge establishes only a set {a, b} and is not an ordered pair--eg, an {N, N}-compound of'boat-house'would allow the ambiguous readings of either'a kind of house'and/or'a kind of boat'. It is only with second-merge that order is derived out of a set {a {a, b}} which yields the recursive properties of syntax--eg, a'House-boat'{house {house, boat}} now reads unambiguously only as a'kind of boat'. It is this property of recursion that allows for projection and labeling of a phrase to take place [1]; in this case, that the Noun'boat'is the Head of the compound, and'house'acting as a kind of specifier/modifier. External-merge (first-merge) establishes substantive'base structure'inherent to the VP, yielding theta/argument structure, and may go beyond the lexical-category VP to involve the functional-category light verb vP. Internal-merge (second-merge) establishes more formal aspects related to edge-properties of scope and discourse-related material pegged to CP. In a Phase-based theory, this twin vP/CP distinction follows the" duality of semantics" discussed within the Minimalist Program, and is further developed into a dual distinction regarding a probe-goal relation.[2] As a consequence, at the" external/first-merge-only" stage, young children would show an inability to interpret readings from a given ordered pair, since they would only have access to the mental parsing of a non-recursive set.(See Roeper … 
Joseph Galasso|Small Children’s Sentences are ‘Dead on Arrival’: Remarks on a Minimalist Approach to Early Child Syntax|Joseph Galasso||Journal of Child Language Acquisition and Development JCLAD|||184||As the title suggests, Small children’s sentences are ‘Dead on Arrival ‘—if by that we mean that the young child‘s syntactic parser is unable to advance (MOVE) a morpho-syntactic utterance, both at PF (phonology form) and at LF (logical form) up the syntactic tree (whereby MOVEment would thus save the derivation from being sent off immediately to early semantic transfer). The deficient for a lack of movement is not just a surface-level PF deficit, but is also pervasive at interpretation. Hence, as a metaphor for the lack of movement (both at PF and LF), children‘s early utterances are indeed semantically frozen deep within the prosaic trappings of the bottom portion of the tree (namely, within the VP phrase) and are thus sent immediately to spell-out. In this paper I propose an initial‗ merge-only ‘stage of child syntax which can account for a rather wide spectrum of implications leading to the impoverished state of early child syntax. Using Chomsky‘s current Minimalist Program (MP) framework, I adopt a‗ Merge over Move ‘hypothesis as a developmental sequence thus accounting for the cited mixed word order, lack of inflection, and misreading of syntactic compounds found in the data.

Joseph Galasso|The Development of English Word Order: A Minimalist Approach|Joseph Galasso|||||||This paper is devoted to examining the variety of word ordering found in the English data. In § 1.1 I present two rather different accounts of variable Word Orders found at the proposed prefunctional stage of language acquisition:(i) Tsimpli (1992), and (ii) a weakened version of Kayne (1995). The main thrust behind the two proposals leads me to conclude that at the very earliest stage of language development, there seems to be some evidence to suggest that some aspects of language principles (typically those associated with LAD) might be subject to maturation (§ 1.2). In § 1.3 I examine the data.(Preview) Following Kayne's LCA, I come to the conclusion that Word Order is indeed a universal hierarchical property of a Spec> Head> Comp relation. However, this, in itself, is not enough to account for the wide array of word order errors found in the early data. Adopting Kayne's Head Medial Principle, I consequently devise a two-pronged model for dealing with the variable word order patterns found at this initial Two-Word phase of development--referred to here as SAS= Single Argument Strings (viz., the phase at which children's speech chiefly consists of one argument; cf. Bowerman 1990). The core assumptions underlying this model are the following. First, that all Heads must be base-generated in medial position. Second, that there exists a Complement Parameter which endeavors to set the Object--here, interpreted as being initially hosted within a non-agreeing Spec position (cf. Larson)--either leftward or rightward of the Head. As a result, this parameter leads to the eventual correct positioning of the agreeing Specifier that must then enter into …

Hence, the overriding question burning in the minds of most developmental linguist is morpho-phonological in nature. For instance, it would seem that the child must at least know (a priori) the stem before she can then engage in a dual-track process by which ambient separation of the morpho-phonological distinction attributive to past tense is carried out, say, between the paradigmatic representation of the English word play vs. play-ed/ple-d/(a dual processing which provokes separation of the/play/-stem and the/d/-affix). Otherwise, it could be conceivable for the young child that the pair play-played would represent all together two different lexical stems, and, stored as such, reflect two distinct though relatively similar semantic notions (a single processing): perhaps not unlike what we do find regarding derived words where an otherwise'two-morpheme'analysis of [teach]-{er} is processed (tagged, stored and retrieved) as a'single-morpheme'stem [teacher], similar to how the word [brother] is stored.[3] 
Joseph Galasso|Why Move? Preliminary Thoughts and Overview|Joseph Galasso|||||||One of the leading questions burning in the minds of most developmental linguists is: To what extent do biological factors—such as a maturational brain—play a role in the early stages of syntactic development? This paper, pulled from chapter 2 of a monograph in preparation, summarizes the Chomskyan Minimalist Program framework regarding the theory of ‘Merge over Move’and attempts to apply it to the earliest observable stages of English Child Syntax. In sum the conclusions reached in this paper suggest that early child syntax is structured in a flat (non-hierarchical manner) whereby (i) only sister-hood relations hold and (ii) that such a flat structure lexical projection would be what one would expect given the young child’s limited capacity to project only simple bricolage merge operations. As a result of a delimited flat structure, all forms of inflection (which are known ‘move’operations which require higher functional projections)) should be absent in early child speech. Such a Non-INFLectional stage-1 is exactly what we find in the data below. But such prosaic structures are not exclusive to early child syntax alone. They too show up in adult target syntax. As an opener to subsequent discussion, consider the semantic vs. syntactic distinction in the following examples (to be expanded upon later in the sections): a. wine bottle> bottle of wine b. coffee cup> cup of coffee c. boat house & house bat The data provided in this present paper provide one theoretical account for the failure of young children to apply local movement at the otherwise well-known stage-one of syntactic development. In examining token samples taken from data of a longitudinal … 
Joseph Galasso|The nature of the input: Outline for talk|Joseph Galasso|||||||1. We take it that there exists a stage prior to the Optional Infinitive stage (Schütze & Wexler 1996). This is evidenced by reports found in the literature which indeed show the presence of an albeit short-lived early Non-INFL/Non-Finite stage. It is worth noting here that the seminal paper of Amy Pierce (1989) and (1992) based on the ‘Nathalie corpus’ demonstrates such a non-Finite stage.(See Atkinson for comments on Pierce. See Wexler (2001) on general comments citing work from Wijnen (1998) and DeJong (2002) for data regarding a pre-optional stage). 2. The possibility that such a Pre-OI stage might exist doesn’t in any way impact or alter what we believe is otherwise correct concerning the OI-stage (save changing the status of OI from a first stage grammar to a stage-2 grammar). 
Joseph Galasso|xyx|Joseph Galasso|||||||Language is quite possibly the most unique of all complex systems known to man, with little if any antecedents to its nature and origin traceable back to a Darwinistic world. It appears that mere communicative needs as would be determined by a Darwinian model could not have possibly provided any great selective pressure to produce such an elaborate system as language that relies heavily on properties of abstraction. What one gains from language rather is an inner symbolic thought process, autonomous and private onto itself, built upon a mentalese which is to a large degree not optimal for serving mere communicative needs. Complicating the picture even more so is the fact that language seems to sit in a kind of ‘no-man’s land’, at a crossroads between being an innate, biologically determined system (on the one hand), and a learned, environmentally driven system (on the other). In other words, language is one and the same both subjective and objective in nature. Because of this, it seems any approximate understanding of language must be informed by a hybrid model of its dualistic nature. Such a model must straddle and bring together both Abstract/Mental and Physical/Material worlds. This coming together should by no means be interpreted as an attempt ‘to make nice’with opposing philosophical camps, but rather, hybrid modeling of language and mind goes far in addressing the very complex and abstract nature of language, particularly in light of the current knowledge linguists have gained over what I think has been a very prosperous half century of linguistics. 
Joseph Galasso|Towards a Weakening of Continuity: Kayne, Wexler and Cinque—Three Cases for a Pre-Functional Stage in Language Acquisition1|Joseph Galasso|||||||This first paper (of a series of twin papers) presents an overall account of the Development of Early Child English Phrase Structure that is based on a Structure-Building model of language acquisition. I argue that a Pre-Functional Stage exists manifesting symmetric Non-specifications' across-the-board'(contra a Under-specification/Optional Infinitive model): citing deficits in the areas of eg,(i) Target Word Order (VP),(ii) Inflection (IP), and (iii) Wh-Question Operator Movement (CP). I argue that any strong continuity stance on acquisition needs to be further examined and possibly'weakened'in order to accommodate the full range of empirical data that follows. 
Joseph Galasso|Non-Correlation between D and I|Joseph Galasso|||||||In this paper, we argue (contra Hoekstra et al: 1996b) against any observed Correlation between D and I. However, in the process of dismantling the correlation, we uncover that a Structural Correlation in fact holds, a correlation basically stating that before any feature deficits can persist (ie, underspecification), the IP-Functional stage must first be established. In more concrete terms, this Structural Correlation (referred to in this paper as the I-to-D Correlation) stipulates two points:(i) that a Subject/Object DP can't go underspecified (ie,+/-FF (FF= Formal Feature)) before the onset of the IP-stage; and, as a consequence,(ii) all Subjects/Objects-DPs prior to the stage where they capacitate checking, instantiate (a posteriori) Objective/Accusative Case (via default). In sum, the above observations redefine how the young child comes to use the premodifying Determiners eg, the/my/mine. Stage-I suggests a pre-underspecification stage. N+ N (Genitive) constructions are used alongside sporadic usage of my/mine. The usage of the determiner The is fully productive from the earliest files. Early usage of the determiners My and Mine may indicate that these Poss (essive) Nom (inals) are, in fact, analogous to the use of The—ie, without their formal features of Genitive Case—hence, all DPs (at this stage) would possibly mark for+ Def (initeness) only. In this sense, the child may freely interchange between analogical The and My/Mine for the same type of logical expression:[DPD [+ def]+ N]; as in The-My/Mine book, etc. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that the child's early (overgenerated) use of mine's (in the literature) may indeed be account for in … 
Joseph Galasso|Verbs and Nouns: INFL and the Emergence of DP|Joseph Galasso|||||||The study of the acquisition of IP and of the Determiner Phrase (= DP) can help determine whether or not Functional Parameterization has taken place in the child's syntax. Under the current Minimalist Program, formal syntax provides a mechanism for Checking morphological features within specific functional (local) domains triggering movement operations either at post-Spell-out (covert) LF, or pre-Spell-out (overt) PF-levels of representation. For instance, if we assume that abstract Nom (inative) Case assignment is checked under a Spec-Head Agr (eement) relation within IP, Gen (itive) Case is checked via a Spec-Head relation within DP, i and Acc (usative) either under a Verb-internal (Head-Comp) relation or via Default, then, a central prediction might be made concerning any possible absence of the functional categories IP and DP in early child clause structure: viz., only instances of Accusative Case assignment (via default) should be notable at prefunctional stages of language development. The following sections examine the acquisition of INFL (ection) along with the role that the DP system plays in the early development of English. In § 1.1, I begin by examining the idea that a correlation exists between D and I. § 1.2 presents the relevant Data as follows: DPs (§ 1.2. 1), Case (§ 1.2. 2) and Tense (§ 1.2. 3).(Preview) Regarding the early emergence of DPs found in the VP-stage (= DP> VP), we come to the conclusion (following Radford: 1990) that they represent for the child a miscategorized lexical category: ie, they function in the same manner as their more primitive NP-counterparts. For instance, owing to this miscategorization, Case … 
Anna Dina L. Joaquin|The Interactional Instinct: The Evolution and Acquisition of Language|Namhee Lee, Lisa Mikesell, Anna Dina L Joaquin, Andrea Mates, John Schumann|2009|||||Oxford University Press|The Interactional Instinct explores the evolution of language from the theoretical view that language could have emerged without a biologically instantiated Universal Grammar. In the first part of the book, the authors speculate that a hominid group with a lexicon of about 600 words could combine these items to make larger meanings. Combinations that are successfully produced, comprehended, and learned become part of the language. Any combination that is incompatible with human mental capacities is abandoned. The authors argue for the emergence of language structure through interaction constrained by human psychology and physiology. In the second part of the book, the authors argue that language acquisition is based on an" interactional instinct" that emotionally entrains the infant on caregivers. This relationship provides children with a motivational and attentional mechanism that ensures their acquisition of language. In adult second language acquisition, the interactional instinct is no longer operating, but in some individuals with sufficient aptitude and motivation, successful second-language acquisition can be achieved. The Interactional Instinct presents a theory of language based on linguistic, evolutionary, and biological evidence indicating that language is a culturally inherited artifact that requires no a priori hard wiring of linguistic knowledge.

Anna Dina L. Joaquin|Exploring the interactional instinct|Anna Dina L Joaquin, John H Schumann|2013|||||Oxford University Press|The Interactional Instinct (Oxford University Press, 2009) argued that the ubiquitous acquisition of language by all normal children was the result of a biologically-based drive for infants and children to attach, bond, and affiliate with conspecifics in an attempt to become like them. This instinct leads children to seek out verbal interaction with caregivers and allows them to become competent language speakers by about age 8. In Exploring the Interactional Instinct, scholars in applied linguistics expand the theory by examining interaction in second language acquisition; in different cultures and species; in observation without participation; in literacy; in schizophrenia; in relation to human physiological responses; and in relation to correlated perspectives on interaction. This book, like its predecessor, offers a radical view of language acquisition: language is not acquired as a result of a Language Acquisition Device in the brain, but is rather a cultural artifact universally acquired by all normal children.

Joaquin|Examining Prewriting Strategies in L2 Writing: Do They Really Work?|Anna Dina L Joaquin, Stephanie Hyeri Kim, Sun-Young Shin|2016/6|The Asian EFL Journal Quarterly June 2016 Volume 18 Issue 2|||156||Prewriting strategies are often taught to L2 learners to help them find a way into the writing topic and organize their ideas before writing an essay. However, little attention has been directed toward understanding whether prewriting and what type of prewriting actually benefits L2 writers. This paper examines the use and efficacy of prewriting strategies among 513 university level English language learners who have taken a timed essay placement exam. Our results show that more than half of the students chose to prewrite, and the majority of those that prewrote chose outlining, listing, or a combination of strategies in the L2. The students that prewrote outperformed those that did not, which confirms previous research findings that prewriting facilitates the writing process for L2 writers. However, in contrast to other studies, among those that prewrote, outlining and listing were not the more effective strategies, and there was no significant difference in test scores among those that used combined strategies. Another finding is that students who elaborated their prewriting scored higher than those who prewrote minimally or in a standard manner. This study provides ESL/EFL researchers and teachers with useful insights into understanding the use and efficacy of prewriting strategies in L2 writers.

Such impairments can emerge as a visible phenomenon in social interaction and therefore can have very real consequences for those who interact with the afflicted (Goodwin, 2003). In this article, I examine how attitudes toward FTD patients are indexed through speech features employed by their interlocutors. I focus on three different speech features typically employed by adults and directed towards subordinates or children: directives, let’s/we framed sequences, and initiation-response-evaluation sequences. These forms are used as strategies to affect and guide FTD patient behaviors, and index how FTD patients are socially constructed as ‘child-like’ and in need of assistance and guidance though not necessarily warranted. Thus, FTD patients may be subject …

Anna Dina L. Joaquin|Enculturation processes in primary language acquisition|Anna Dina L Joaquin|2013|||||Equinox|The first part of the book examines the practices by which we are enculturated. Indeed, members of a society are socialized into their culture, and more specifically to use language through language via processes that include eavesdropping, observation, participation, imitation, and language socialization. However, ethnographic accounts also overwhelmingly show that children become enculturated in large part on their own initiative. The second part of the book argues for a motivation to attune to, seek out, and become like others—or an ‘interactional instinct’, which facilitates enculturation and the biology that subserves it. The closing chapters explore more of our biological readiness and the neurological structures and systems that may have evolved to respond to the input provided by society to facilitate the learning of cultural practices and traditions by its youth. The picture that emerges indicates that biology is nature and culture is nurture, but there is no nurture without nature, and it is nurture that provides for the phylogenetic development of our biological nature. The ontogenesis of language behavior, ie its acquisition, cannot occur without its evolved biology or without its evolved cultural practices for socialization.

He explains that he began this project with the intention of writing a book on the sociology of AL that would contribute ‘to the establishment of AL as a discipline’(p. xiii). However, de Bot has achieved more than this: the book broadens a reader’s view on what applied linguistics is, what an applied linguist is, who its leaders are, what its foundational theoretical perspectives are, what the challenges of the field are as it matures and establishes itself in academia, and what impact the field has made. This is not achieved by providing a handbook of different subfields; there are other edited volumes that are devoted to that (eg. Kaplan 2002; Davies 2004; Simpson 2011). Instead, de Bot has sought the views of around 100 scholars (some in faceto-face … 
Anna Dina L. Joaquin|Resonance in Dialogic Interaction|Anna Dina L Joaquin|2013/11/4|Exploring the interactional instinct|||57|Oxford University Press|In physics, resonance refers to the condition in which an object or system is subject to an oscillating signal having a frequency at or close to that of a natural vibration of the object or system. It is a tendency of one system to match the resonance frequency of another resonance system, as a result of forced vibration. Thus, an object may have intrinsic properties that make it a candidate to resonate with certain other objects. A classic example of resonance is observable when a vibrating tuning fork with an intrinsic frequency is brought into close proximity to another tuning fork designed to vibrate at a similar or the same frequency. The second tuning fork will inevitably begin to vibrate and will continue until the frequency matches that of the first. Also, if the tuning fork is brought close to another object, say, a whiteboard in a classroom, the vibrations of the tuning fork will force whiteboard particles to vibrate. DuBois (2000) analogizes the resonance principle to the interaction between and among interlocutors. To make his analogy, he considers the intrinsic quality of words and utterances, such as their meaning, phonology, and rhythms. He posits “an intrinsic potential affinity”(p. 8), or resonance, among linguistic elements (words, sounds, meaning) that are comparable to each other and are activated when elements are in close proximity, resulting in speakers’ utterances displaying similarities in structure and meaning. To further his analogy, to include the full scope of dialogic interaction, one can imagine gazes, body movements, and rhythms of each speaker beginning to match those of their interlocutor’s, resulting in verbal and motor resonance. In this … 
Anna Dina L. Joaquin|The Interactional Instinct and Related Perspectives|John H Schumann, Emre Güvendir, Anna Dina L Joaquin|2013/11/4|Exploring the Interactional Instinct|||256|Oxford University Press|Our current work views the interactional instinct (II) as related to a constellation of conceptualizations that see language, language evolution, language acquisition, and language use from an interactive socioaffective perspective (eg, the pedagogical stance/natural pedagogy, willingness to communicate). In this chapter, we examine the interactional instinct in relation to six other perspectives: the social instinct, the interactional engine, the cultural intelligence hypothesis, the interaction hypothesis, relational models, and the perspective of language as shaped by the brain. This general constellation may be correct, but it is unlikely that any of the approaches alone can provide an adequate framework for understanding language. We see the various perspectives as correlated variations on language acquisition and use which capture different facets of these phenomena. Finding a winner among them is neither our goal nor, in our view, a reasonable possibility.

Anna Dina L. Joaquin|Learning while Eavesdropping on the Social World|Anna Dina L Joaquin|2013/11/4|Exploring the Interactional Instinct|||34|Oxford University Press|When we think of how we learn a language, we often have a model in mind in which a more competent member instructs a naïve member of society in the aspects of a language and how to use language. Certainly, researchers from a language socialization paradigm (Ochs & Schieffelin, 1984; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986) have shown through ethnographic work the ways in which “language is used to socialize human beings and how we are socialized to use language”(Shieffelin & Ochs, 1986, p. 163). However, many ethnographic researchers have also suggested that children in some parts of the world have to learn language mostly, if not exclusively, through eavesdropping (Rogoff, 2003; Schieffelin, 1990). In fact, even in Western societies, where prompting and ostensive cues are considered ubiquitous, labeling (eg, pointing and saying “cup”) and deictic statements (ie, This is a cup) actually account for fewer than 20 percent of caregiver utterances to children younger than 3 years old (Goddard et al., 1985; Newport et al., 1977). Without such explicit teaching it would certainly seem that what children are faced with does not seem to be an easy task. Children have to extract phonemes, words, and syntactic structure from the connected speech that they overhear, and somehow find their meanings while learning the appropriate contexts in which they are to be used—and they often have to do such implicit learning in multiparty contexts. Chomsky (1957) argued that given such “noise” in social environments and insufficient input there is no plausible way that children could learn language without a priori knowledge.

Well as a discourse marker has been examined extensively from various perspectives. In conversation analysis, well is described as indexing “dispreferredness” (Pomerantz, 1984) and “unstraightforwardness” in second position (e.g., responses to assessments and questions). By examining American and British English conversations, the present study investigates the use of well in a previously unexamined sequential position, third position, and demonstrates that the well: (a) retroactively marks the prior action (i.e., the question) as having been preliminary to the impending turn and (b) prospectively marks the impending turn as the reason for the question.

Based upon conversation analysis of video- and audio-recorded conversations, this article demonstrates that speakers, by using –ta in a high boundary tone, display the conveyed information as announceable and newsworthy, thereby highlighting newness of the information. Due to these characteristics, -ta utterances are overwhelmingly found in pre-telling sequences in which speakers announce news and within telling sequences in which speakers provide information that they believe is tellable for the development of a telling.

Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Beginning an action in English and Korean: Turn design and action projection|Hye Ri Kim|2011||||||This dissertation examines three different ways speakers begin an action in English and Korean, using Conversation Analysis. It is now a well-established fact that significant interactional work is accomplished in the beginnings of a turn in talk-in-interaction. Turn-beginnings are a prime location at which parties in an interaction begin to reveal their understanding of the prior turn as well as reveal the type and shape of the forthcoming turn. It is also a place at which speakers can manipulate various constraints set upon them by the prior turn. The dissertation shows that speakers of typologically different languages organize their actions in a strikingly similar way by using the linguistic resources available in the language. This is demonstrated by the analyses of two Korean turn prefaces kulenikka and ani and one English turn preface well, as they occur in second and third position turns. The study shows that the practice … 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Reshaping the response space with kulenikka in beginning to respond to questions in Korean conversation|Hye Ri Stephanie Kim|2013/10/1|Journal of Pragmatics|57||303-317|North-Holland|Respondents have various ways of resisting the constraints that questions impose on them. In this article I show one way in which Korean speakers deal with trouble of responding to questions as put when beginning to respond: Prefacing their responses with kulenikka. The analysis shows that kulenikka marks the response as departing from the question's terms and signals a reshaping of the response space. Three common contexts for this departure are: Respondents (1) cannot conform to the question's terms due to the question's inadequate presuppositions; (2) defer a straightforward or type-conforming answer; and (3) evade the question. The findings contribute to a developing body of conversation analytic research on how question recipients display resistance to questions, and more generally how turn-beginnings serve as an important place in interaction. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Resisting the terms of polar questions through ani (‘no’)-prefacing in Korean conversation|Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2015/5/19|Discourse Processes|52|4|311-334|Routledge|This article reports on the conversation-analytic investigation of ani ‘no’-prefaced responses to polar questions in Korean conversation, when ani is not used as a negative response particle to negate or disconfirm the truth conditional proposition of the question. Understanding polar questions as advancing the questioner's hypothesis for confirmation, the article demonstrates that the ani-preface in the responsive turn resists (1) the polar question's presupposition that the hypothesis is confirmable and (2) the framing of the proposed hypothesis. Overall, the study rediscovers ani ‘no’ as a turn-beginning particle that indexes the respondent's resistance to responding to the question as framed and further discusses the token's “positionally sensitive” character by discussing cases of ani-prefaced turns that occur in response to wh-questions. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Turn formats for other-initiated repair and their relation to trouble sources: Some observations from Japanese and Korean conversations|Makoto Hayashi, Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2015/10/1|Journal of Pragmatics|87||198-217|North-Holland|Intended as a contribution to our understanding of the principles underlying the selection of turn formats used for other-initiated repair (OIR), this study explores the relationship between OIR turn formats involving the “what” token in Japanese and Korean and the types of trouble addressed by them. We focus in particular on the differentiation between “open class repair initiators” (Drew, 1997) and OIR that targets a specific referential element in the trouble-source turn. We show that, while prosody plays an important role in distinguishing the two in Korean, it does not in Japanese. Instead, Japanese speakers rely on grammatical resources, in particular postpositional particles, to accomplish the differentiation. We also discuss one type of OIR turn format in Japanese, nani ga (‘what’ followed by the nominative particle ga), whose workings deviate from those of all the other OIR turn formats consisting of “what” followed …

Cross-linguistic data indicate that there are distinctive communicative functions which are specific to the left or right peripheries. For instance, studies show that the left periphery (lp) is mainly concerned with discourse organization (eg topic shift), whereas the right periphery (rp) indicates a modal function (eg speaker’s stance towards the message or the addressee)(Beeching and Detges, this volume). Previous studies have provided functional linguists with invaluable insights into the functional differences between the two peripheries. Nonetheless, there are some pending issues to be explored. First of all, while periphery typically … 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Examining Prewriting Strategies in L2 Writing: Do They Really Work?|Anna Dina L Joaquin, Stephanie Hyeri Kim, Sun-Young Shin|2016/6|The Asian EFL Journal Quarterly June 2016 Volume 18 Issue 2|||156||Prewriting strategies are often taught to L2 learners to help them find a way into the writing topic and organize their ideas before writing an essay. However, little attention has been directed toward understanding whether prewriting and what type of prewriting actually benefits L2 writers. This paper examines the use and efficacy of prewriting strategies among 513 university level English language learners who have taken a timed essay placement exam. Our results show that more than half of the students chose to prewrite, and the majority of those that prewrote chose outlining, listing, or a combination of strategies in the L2. The students that prewrote outperformed those that did not, which confirms previous research findings that prewriting facilitates the writing process for L2 writers. However, in contrast to other studies, among those that prewrote, outlining and listing were not the more effective strategies, and there was no significant difference in test scores among those that used combined strategies. Another finding is that students who elaborated their prewriting scored higher than those who prewrote minimally or in a standard manner. This study provides ESL/EFL researchers and teachers with useful insights into understanding the use and efficacy of prewriting strategies in L2 writers. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Grammar as an emergent response to interactional needs: A study of final kuntey ‘but’in Korean conversation|Stephanie Hyeri Kim, Sung-Ock Sohn|2015/7/1|Journal of Pragmatics|83||73-90|North-Holland|This paper illustrates the interactional uses of the Korean contrastive connective kuntey ‘but’ in a previously unexamined position – sentence-final position – and suggests that this final kuntey is on a grammaticalization pathway to a sentence-final particle. While the target ‘final kuntey’ exhibits similar functions to those of turn-initial kuntey described in prior research, occurring in such contexts as dispreferred responses, topic resumption, and sequence closings, the primary context in which final kuntey is found involves the speaker rejecting the course of action proposed by the prior speaker and shifting the prior talk's frame to a slightly revised one. Such actions are ‘disaffiliative’ and are commonly managed as delicate social actions in interaction. We argue that the final position that kuntey occupies in a turn is a resource with which speakers delay their disaffiliative stance and use as a face-saving strategy. We further … 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Initiating repair with and without particles: Alternative formats of other-initiation of repair in Korean conversation|Mary Shin Kim, Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2014/10/2|Research on Language and Social Interaction|47|4|331-352|Routledge|This study examines Korean speakers’ practice of initiating repair on the recipient’s talk with and without a subject or object particle and shows that the addition (or deletion) of the particle plays an important role in implementing the action of repair initiation. Initiating repair with a particle ordinarily serves as a harbinger of disagreement, surprise, or disbelief, while initiating repair without a particle functions as an understanding check. The study further suggests possible explanations for how and why the addition of the particle achieves the interactional work of performing a negatively valenced action in Korean. Data are in Korean with English translation. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Ani-prefaced accounts in korean conversation|Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2016/6/8|Accountability in social interaction|||294|Oxford University Press|Asking questions—that is, implementing various types of interrogatives, declaratives, etc. that seek information (see Steensig & Drew, 2008; Stivers et al., 2010)—is one of the most common means through which speakers carry out their daily conduct. However, questions are rarely “innocent.” That is, questions variously constrain answers through questions’ presuppositions, preference organizations, and topical and action agendas (Boyd & Heritage, 2006; Clayman & Heritage, 2002; Heritage, 2002; Heritage & Clayman, 2010). Furthermore, the action implemented by questions is rarely that of seeking information alone (and sometimes not at all). That is, questions are often vehicles through which other actions—such as complaining, criticizing, challenging, and complimenting—are implemented (Koshik, 2003; Schegloff, 1984; Steensig & Drew, 2008). Finally, questions’ topics and agendas can be socially inappropriate, and questions’ relevance and/or motivations can be unclear (Kim, 2013b). Thus, the relevance of questioning can be challenged because inferences can be built by questioning (see Sacks, 1992, It is such an honor to have this opportunity to pay tribute to John Heritage by contributing this chapter to the volume. John’s work (particularly his work on turn-initial particles, questions and responses, and accountability) has had a strong influence on every piece of work that I have published, and I am indebted to John for his teaching and for allowing me to “stand on his shoulders.” I am also grateful for his feedback on earlier versions of this paper. I also thank the editor of this volume, Jeffrey D. Robinson, because his detailed comments … 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Constructing ‘an institution’: A case from a Korean student group meeting|Hye Ri Stephanie Kim|2013|Issues in Applied Linguistics|19||||Using Conversation Analysis, this study describes how ‘institutionality’ is accomplished in talk-in-interaction by analyzing how the Korean student group members construct themselves as ‘an institution’ through decision-making. Most conversation-analytic research on institutional talk has been of occupational settings. This study, with data from a voluntary student staff group whose meetings are sporadic and without formal phases, illustrates that the group members’ interaction reveals how they construct themselves as a decision-making group whose members embody different social roles, and ultimately as an institution. Two significant practices are discussed. First, the data show that the members actively search for precedents, which later become the most crucial basis for their decision-making. Second, as a strategy of gathering power over others within their institutional boundary, the members frequently depart from the preference structure of ordinary conversation. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of institutionality with data from a quasi-institutional setting in the relatively under-examined language, Korean. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Conversation Analysis|Stephanie Hyeri Kim, Kyu‐hyun Kim|2015/6/15|The Handbook of Korean Linguistics|||269-286|John Wiley & Sons, Inc|This chapter overviews conversation analytic studies conducted on Korean language. Conversation analysis is now a well‐established approach that considers naturally occurring talk as “the primordial site of sociality” and “aims to describe, analyze and understand talk as a basic and constitutive feature of human social life”. The interest in CA in Korean academia was registered by some Korean linguists presumably as early as the late 1970s, soon after the seminal paper on turn‐taking by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson appeared in Language in 1974. The agenda of many of early studies was apparently shaped by the analytic concerns of Korean linguists and grammarians, which include studies of connectives and modal markers. This chapter attempts to provide an accessible introduction to CA and a sketch of the topics Korean conversation analysts (CAsts) have addressed in the last two decades by covering … 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Two types of trouble with questions|Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2018/7/15|Between Turn and Sequence: Turn-initial particles across languages|31||97|John Benjamins Publishing Company|Most previous studies of Korean conversation have focused on clause-or sentence-final elements to describe various interactional strategies of conversationalists. This chapter demonstrates that the beginnings of a turn in Korean are also an interactionally important place, and provides a comparative analysis of two turn-initial particles used in responses to questions: kulssey and kulenikka. Both particles can be translated as well in the target sequential position and index that there is some trouble with the question. However, each particle is used for addressing a particular type of trouble with the preceding question and for indexing a specific upcoming action. This chapter includes an account for how the particles may have acquired these functions, and a brief comparison of the particles to the comparable English particle well. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Enacting surprise with ani ‘no’-prefaced questions|Stephanie Hyeri Kim|2017/11/9|East Asian Pragmatics|2|2|141-161||This study focuses on the use of the particle ani ‘no’as a preface to questions in Korean conversation. Using ordinary telephone conversations as data, the study examines the practice of ani prefacing in a previously unexplored position: questions that begin with ani. The cases show that ani-prefaced questions display the speaker’s surprise at some content of the recipient’s prior talk and sometimes even serve to challenge the truthfulness of the surprise source. In this context, the ani preface serves as an alert that these actions should be understood as a departure from the ongoing course of action and as a distinct issue to be addressed. The article also discusses ani’s uses in turn-initial position in relation to its use in other positions. 
Stephanie Hyeri Kim|Test taker-initiated repairs in an English oral proficiency exam for international teaching assistants|Stephanie Hyeri Kim, Innhwa Park|2015/3/1|Text & Talk|35|2|237-262|De Gruyter|This paper is a conversation-analytic examination of video-recorded interactions between questioners and test takers during an English oral proficiency exam for international teaching assistants (ITAs). We focus on the test takers’ repair strategies identified in our data, and describe how distinct repair strategies influence the repair solution in the next turn. The test takers’ open-class repair initiator (eg,“sorry?”) is likely to be treated as a hearing problem, and thus is responded to with the questioners’ repetition of the question. In contrast, the test takers’ targeted repair initiator (eg,“what do you mean by x?”) is likely to be treated as an understanding problem, and thus is responded to with the questioners’ reformulation of the question. This reformulation generally helps the test takers successfully respond to the question despite the initial understanding problem. The findings have implications for teaching oral …

Robert Gressis|Recent work on Kantian maxims I: Established approaches|Rob Gressis|2010/3|Philosophy Compass|5|3|216-227|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Maxims play a crucial role in Kant’s ethical philosophy, but there is significant disagreement about what maxims are. In this two‐part essay, I survey eight different views of Kantian maxims, presenting their strengths, and their weaknesses. Part I: Established Approaches, begins with Rüdiger Bubner’s view that Kant took maxims to be what ordinary people of today take them to be, namely pithily expressed precepts of morality or prudence. Next comes the position, most associated with Rüdiger Bittner and Otfried Höffe, that maxims are Lebensregeln, or ‘life‐rules’– quite general rules for how to conduct oneself based on equally general outlooks on how the world is. These first two interpretations make sense of Kant’s claim, made in his anthropological and pedagogical writings, that we have to learn how to act on maxims, but they become less plausible in light of Kant’s probable view that people always act on …

In this two‐part essay, I survey eight different views of Kantian maxims, presenting their strengths and their weaknesses. In Part II: New Approaches, I look at three more recent views in somewhat greater detail than I do the five treatments canvassed in 'Recent Works on Kantian Maxims I: Established Approaches’. First, there is Richard McCarty’s Interpretation, which holds that Kant’s understanding of maxims can be illuminated by placing them in the context of the Wollfian tradition, according to which maxims are the major premises of practical syllogisms. The next subject Maria Schwartz, holds that careful attention to Kant’s distinction between rules and maxims, as well as Kant’s concept of happiness, allows us to make sense of almost all of Kant’s remarks on maxims. It may be, however, that on … 
Robert Gressis|Does religious belief matter for grief and death anxiety? Experimental philosophy meets psychology of religion|David B Feldman, Ian C Fischer, Robert A Gressis|2016/9|Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|55|3|531-539||It is commonly reasoned that religious belief moderates death anxiety and aids in coping with loss. However, a philosophical perspective known as meta‐atheism includes the claim that avowed religious believers grieve deaths and experience death anxiety as intensely as avowed atheists. Thus, we report a study comparing religious believers and nonbelievers on measures of death anxiety and grief. We further investigated the relationships between certain religious beliefs (views of God, afterlife belief, religious orientation) and death anxiety, as well as both painful grief reactions and grief‐related growth. We surveyed 101 participants across the United States, ranging in age (19 to 57), education, and ethnicity. Participants avowing some form of religious belief, in comparison to those not, did not demonstrate lower levels of death anxiety. They did, however, display higher levels of a certain type of death …

Robert Gressis|How to Be Evil: The Moral Psychology of Immorality|Robert Gressis|2009|Rethinking Kant|1||191-216||Kant is one of the few major philosophers to deal at length with evil. Unfommately, his theory of evil, as presented in Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, seems to be unbelievable. Rather than enumerate all the problems scholars have found in that work, I will instead defend Kant against one particular claim, made most recently by Claudia Card: On Kant’s view, the same evil is present in all wrongs—serious and trivial ones alike—that are committed by anyone who subordinates morality to self interest. The deliberate choices of both murderer and subway free rider are wrong in exactly the same way. The fact that no one suffers in one case and someone dies in the other is, for Kant, morally irrelevant. It affects neither his judgment of the act nor his judgment of the agent. Yet, on any ordinary understanding of evil, one act (murder) is evil, and the other, although wrong, is not. 
Robert Gressis|Kant's Theory of Evil: An Interpretation and Defense.|Robert A Gressis|2007||||||Kant’s theory of evil, presented most fully in his Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, has been consistently misinterpreted since he first presented it. As a result, readers have taken it to be a mess of inconsistencies and eccentricities and so have tried to mine it for an insight or two, dismissed it altogether, or sought to explain how Kant could have gone so wrong. In this work, I provide an interpretation of Kant’s theory of evil that renders it consistent and plausible. The main problem Kant tries to solve with his theory of evil is the problem of willful immorality: how can someone who sees her moral obligations as overridingly authoritative willingly (and so culpably) transgress them? Kant’s answer is that we do so by indulging various “moral fantasies” – ways of reconceiving the moral law or one’s status in relation to it. By entertaining, e.g., the fantasy that one is exempt from the moral law’s commands (“the exceptionalist fantasy”), or that one cannot live up to them (“despondency”), or that one need only to live up to society’s standards rather than moral demands (“the adequacy fantasy”) – one persuades oneself that the duty the moral law demands one to perform is only optional. Moral fantasies appeal only because of the presence, in everyone, of the “propensity to evil,” which makes the moral law’s commands seem less authoritative, thereby strengthening one’s sensuous desires. As a result, moral fantasies thereby diminish the urgency of moral obligations, and so tempt us to entertain them. Scholars of Kant have missed this explanation of wickedness because they have restricted their attention to the Religion, a work whose gnomic … 
Robert Gressis|Kant’s Theodicy and its Role in the Development of Radical Evil|Robert Gressis|2018/3/7|Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie|100|1|46-75|De Gruyter|In the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant claims that rational beings should want to have no inclinations. But in Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason, he asserts that the inclinations are good in themselves. While many commentators hold that Kant simply wrote hyperbolically in the Groundwork and the second Critique, I argue Kant was sincere, and changed his mind about the worth of the inclinations between the second Critique and the Religion. This is because he changed his mind about the source of immorality: whereas in the Groundwork and Critique of Practical Reason Kant took our inclinations to be tempters, starting in “Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy” and concluding in the Religion, he posited a self-imposed propensity to evil as the source of immorality. Kant’s reason for changing his mind about the source of immorality was partly … 
Robert Gressis|True religion in Hume’s Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion|Tim Black, Robert Gressis|2017/3/4|British Journal for the History of Philosophy|25|2|244-264|Routledge|Many think that the aim of Hume’s Dialogues is simply to discredit the design argument for the existence of an intelligent designer. We think instead that the Dialogues provides a model of true religion. We argue that, for Hume, the truly religious person: (1) believes that an intelligent designer created and imposed order on the universe; (2) grounds this belief in an irregular argument rooted in a certain kind of experience, for example, in the experience of anatomizing complex natural systems such as the eye; and (3) retains this belief, on the basis of these reasons, even after careful scrutiny. We argue that two of the Dialogues’s characters, Philo and Cleanthes, exhibit true religion. A third character, Demea, exhibits false religion and a persistent impiety. Taken as a whole, we see the Dialogues as an educational performance for the benefit of Pamphilus, Cleanthes’s ward, as well as for the benefit of readers of the …

Robert Gressis|Kant’s Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism, written by Diane Williamson|Robert Gressis|2018/4/17|Journal of Moral Philosophy|15|2|217-220|Brill|In Kant’s Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism, Diane Williamson does three things: first, she articulates and criticizes contemporary theories of emotion; second, she explains Kant’s theory of emotion, with particular emphasis on how a proper grasp of it enriches understanding of his moral theory; and third, she describes what it is like to live as someone convinced by Kant’s moral and emotional theories. The first three chapters are dedicated to contemporary theories of emotion, both popular and scholarly. In Chapter 1,“Profiles of Emotionality”, she sketches three popular theories of emotion: Stoicism, romanticism, and popular psychology. Each of these theories is crude, and consequently commends a wrongheaded approach to responding to one’s emotions. Stoicism sees emotions as threats to rationality, and so recommends repression. Romanticism views emotions as authentic expressions of oneself, and … 
Robert Gressis|Why Is Kant Noncommittal About Grace?|Robert Gressis|2017/12/8|Con-Textos Kantianos. International Journal of Philosophy|1|6|272-284||In Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason, Kant claims that we may need to invoke divine aid in order to explain how a person can change from evil to good. Kant’s language is a bit curious; why does he not more clearly assert, either that we must posit divine grace, or that we may not? The explanation is this: if we affirm that God grants aid, then this could convince people to passively await it or to think, upon becoming good, that they are part of a special elect. On the other hand, if we affirm that God does not help, then some may despair of ever becoming good while those who successfully change could become arrogant. Thus, Kant is noncommittal about grace because it allows the morally timorous to have hope that they can change, and the morally successful to avoid hubris.

Robert Gressis|Kantian Practical Ethics|Robert Gressis|2013/1/16|International Encyclopedia of Ethics||||Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was probably the most important philosopher of the modern era (see Kant, Immanuel; Late Modern British Ethics). He made groundbreaking contributions in both theoretical philosophy (especially epistemology and metaphysics) and practical philosophy (especially ethics and political philosophy). While his theoretical philosophy set the agenda for much of the theoretical philosophy that followed it, most succeeding philosophers reject its foundational claims (such as the ideality of space and time), even as they agree with certain of the conclusions that Kant drew from those claims (such as the limitation of knowledge to the spatiotemporal realm). By contrast, many post‐Kantian philosophers agree with the foundational principle of Kant's normative ethics, the “Formula of Humanity” (treat humanity, wherever you find it, always as an end in itself and never as a mere means to your ends …

While I think BGKE only partially meets its first goal, it does a very good job at satisfying its second goal. I shall explain why at the end of this review. But first, here is what one can expect to find in the book. BGKE consists of an introduction and 12 chapters, divided into five parts.

Firestone describes Kant and Theology at the Boundaries of Reason (KTBR) as “the attempt of a Christian scholar of Kant to show where theology gains a foothold in Kant’s philosophy and how theologians have capitalized on these footholds to construct meaningful and robust theological systems”(viii). KTBR’s audience is “anyone who wants an up-to-date analysis of the grounds for theology in Kant’s philosophy and help with determining where theology must go in the future if we are to do theology in dialogue with Kant”(ix). In addition, it serves as a useful companion piece to Firestone’s earlier work, co-authored with Nathan Jacobs, In Defense of Kant’s Religion.

Robert Gressis|What Good Is Religious Belief for Fear of Death and Grief?|David B Feldman, Ian C Fischer, Robert A Gressis||Inter-Disciplinary Press|||67||It is commonly believed that religious convictions moderate death anxiety and aid in coping with loss. However, scant research addresses this issue. We detail the results of an empirical study comparing religious believers and non-believers on measures of death anxiety and grief. More precisely, we investigated the relationships between certain religious beliefs (eg, specific views of God and extrinsic vs. intrinsic religiosity) and levels of fear and acceptance of death, as well as both painful grief reactions to losses and grief-related growth (eg, deepening relationships with others, discovering new views of life, etc.). A total of 101 participants from across the US were surveyed, including individuals with an array of ages (19 to 57), education levels, and ethnicities. About half professed religious or spiritual belief, and 71 participants lost a loved one in the last 10 years. Those with some form of belief did not demonstrate lower levels of death anxiety. They did, however, display higher levels of certain types of death acceptance. Additionally, those who professed some form of religious belief, in comparison to those who did not, tended to have lower levels of grief and greater levels of griefrelated growth. Those believers who viewed God as warm and interested in their lives (versus more distant) had significantly lower levels of personal fear of death. Similarly, those with high intrinsic religious motivation (seeing religious participation as a valuable goal in itself, rather than instrumental to achieving other goals) reported lower levels of fear of death and higher levels of death acceptance. In short, though religious belief appears to matter in general with regard … 
Kristina Meshelski|Procedural Justice and Affirmative Action|Kristina Meshelski|2016|Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|19|2|425-443|Springer|There is widespread agreement among both supporters and opponents that affirmative action either must not violate any principle of equal opportunity or procedural justice, or if it does, it may do so only given current extenuating circumstances. Many believe that affirmative action is morally problematic, only justified to the extent that it brings us closer to the time when we will no longer need it. In other words, those that support affirmative action believe it is acceptable in nonideal theory, but not ideal theory. This paper argues that affirmative action is entirely compatible with equal opportunity and procedural justice and would be even in an ideal world. I defend a new analysis of Rawlsian procedural justice according to which it is permissible to interfere in the outcomes of procedures, and thus I show that affirmative action is not morally problematic in the way that many have supposed. 
Kristina Meshelski|Two Kinds of Definition in Spinoza's Ethics|Kristina Meshelski|2011/3/1|British Journal for the History of Philosophy|19|2|201-218|Routledge|Spinoza scholars have claimed that we are faced with a dilemma: either Spinoza's definitions in his Ethics are real, in spite of indications to the contrary, or the definitions are nominal and the propositions derived from them are false. I argue that Spinoza did not recognize the distinction between real and nominal definitions. Rather, Spinoza classified definitions according to whether they require a priori or a posteriori justification, which is a classification distinct from either the real/nominal or the intensional/extensional classification. I argue that Spinoza uses both a priori and a posteriori definitions in the Ethics and that recognizing both types of definitions allows us to understand Spinoza's geometric method in a new way. We can now understand the geometric method as two methods, one resulting in propositions that Spinoza considers to be absolutely certain and another resulting in propositions that Spinoza does … 
Kristina Meshelski|Feminism and non-ideal theory: The problem with facts|Kristina Meshelski|2010||||||Due to influence of the work of Carol Gillian (1982), Susan Moller Okin (1989), Nancy Fraser (1990), and Charles Mills (1997, 2005), there has been an assumption among many feminists that political philosophy should take a direction towards facts, toward a greater understanding and appreciation for the lives of actual women, and away from idealizations, which will ultimately be harmful to women. The recent popularity of non-ideal theory in political philosophy has reinvigorated these old debates (see Schwartzman 2006, Sen 2006, Farrelly 2007, Robeyns 2008, Stepmplowska 2008, Swift 2008, Valentini 2009). Some argue that since idealizations are inevitable, moving forward is a matter of choosing nonoppressive ideals and using them wisely (Schwartzman 2006, Valentini 2009), while the rest move to separate ideal theory from non-ideal theory and thus mitigate or eliminate the influence of idealizations entirely. Focusing on this trend in the recent literature, I will show that in general the role of idealizations in political philosophy has been misunderstood and that the move towards a greater reliance on “facts” is in fact a step backwards for the feminist movement. In a recent article, Laura Valentini (2009) suggests that idealizations of the subject to which the theory applies are often dangerous and will tend to benefit the dominant group or groups, while idealizations of a subject that plays only a theoretical role, and is not the same subject to which the theory is supposed to apply, are benign. Taking this helpful suggestion, we can see why Nancy Fraser’s influential criticism of Habermas (1990) is different, and I argue, more successful, than Susan … 
Robin M. Muller|The Logic of the Chiasm in Merleau-Ponty's Early Philosophy|Robin M Muller|2017|Ergo, an Open Access Journal of Philosophy|4|||Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library|The trajectory of Merleau-Ponty’s career is often seen as a progressive development: he begins by analyzing scientific consciousness in The Structure of Behavior, complements that account with a phenomenological analysis of behavior as lived in Phenomenology of Perception, and then overcomes the “philosophy of consciousness” to which the earlier texts are committed in the turn toward an ontology of flesh in The Visible and the Invisible. Through close readings of Merleau-Ponty’s engagements with Gestalt psychology in The Structure of Behavior, I argue that the immanent critique of Gestalt theory in that text already anticipates the chiasmic logic of flesh. This challenges the idea of a turn in Merleau-Ponty’s thinking. I begin by outlining the elemental, carnal, and reversible status of flesh. With careful attention to his source materials, I then distinguish Merleau-Ponty’s appropriations of Gestalt theoretical insights from his critical adaptations, defending three claims:(1) The Structure of Behavior borrows insights from Gestalt theorists that are undermined by their own, realistic ontology;(2) it modifies those insights to explicitly acknowledge the elemental status of nature; and (3) those modifications enable Merleau-Ponty to re-interpret Gestalt psychologists’ empirical findings, outlining how consciousness must emerge from nature as both carnal and reversible. 
Robin M. Muller|The romantic subject of perception: A phenomenological account of conceptual mindedness|Robin M Muller|2015||||||This dissertation concerns the role conceptual capacities play in the deliverance of sense contents. Intervening in debates that concern how the normative dimensions of the mind could be squared with the phenomenality of perceptual experience, I defend a minimally conceptualist position modified from John McDowell. I argue, moreover, that this minimal conceptualism is compatible with (is, in fact, already presumed in) existential phenomenology. Whereas critics argue that conceptualism, which grants no independent contribution to receptivity, makes mysterious how experience could exhibit an'aesthetic'character; and whereas many find support for this objection in phenomenology, my dissertation takes aim at the legitimacy of that support. This strategy lets me propose a way to resolve the debate, not by advocating non-conceptualism, but by widening our resources for thinking about mental capacities. The … 
Takashi Yagisawa|Beyond possible worlds|Takashi Yagisawa|1988/3/1|Philosophical Studies|53|2|175-204|Springer Netherlands|David Lewis believes in the thesis known as modal realism. The thesis says that our actual world and its inhabitants do not exhaust everything that there is; there are other possible but non-actual worlds and their possible but non-actual inhabitants. Our world is but one of many possible worlds. There are as many possible worlds as there are ways the world could possibly be. Each world is isolated from any other in a rather strong sense; no two worlds overlap or are spatiotemporally or causally related in any way. To many this appears to be an outrageously implausible thesis. But Lewis has his reason for believing it.

Takashi Yagisawa|Worlds and individuals, possible and otherwise|Takashi Yagisawa|2010|||||Oxford University Press|Modal realism says that non-actual possible worlds and individuals are as real as the actual world and individuals. Takashi Yagisawa defends modal realism of a variety different from David Lewis's theory. The notion of reality is left primitive and sharply distinguished from that of existence, which is proposed as a relation between a thing and a domain. Worlds are postulated as modal indices for truth on a par with times, which are temporal indices for truth. Ordinary individualobjects are conceived as being extended in spatial, temporal, and modal dimensions, and their transworld identity is explicated by the closest-continuer theory. Impossible worlds and individuals are postulated and used to provide accounts of propositions, belief sentences, and fictionaldiscourse.

Takashi Yagisawa|Possible objects|Takashi Yagisawa|2005/4/15||||||Deep theorizing about possibility requires theorizing about possible objects. One popular approach regards the notion of a possible object as intertwined with the notion of a possible world. There are two widely discussed types of theory concerning the nature of possible worlds: actualist representationism and possibilist realism. They support two opposing views about possible objects. Examination of the ways in which they do so reveals difficulties on both sides. There is another popular approach, which has been influenced by the philosophy of Alexius Meinong. The Meinongian approach is relevant to theorizing about possible objects because it attempts to construct a general theory of objects other than ordinary concrete existing objects. Independently of the debate about the nature of possible worlds or about Meinongianism, it is not always as straightforward as it may at first appear to determine whether … 
Takashi Yagisawa|A semantic solution to Frege's puzzle|Takashi Yagisawa|1993/1/1|Philosophical Perspectives|7||135-154|Ridgeview Publishing Company, Wiley|Gottlob Frege observed that a sentence of the form'a= b'has a different cognitive value (Erkenntniswert) from a sentence of the form'a= a,'where'a'and'b'are co-referential proper names;'a= b'is informative, one might say, and'a= a'is not. From this he inferred that (proper) names have senses (Sinne) and that the sense of a name may be different from the sense of another co-referential name. 1 It follows from this that the sense of a name is not determined by its referent. Frege thought that the sense of a name is analogous to the sense of a definite description on three counts:(i) it is the descriptive content of the term;(ii) it determines the reference of the term; and (iii) it contributes to the cognitive value of any expression in which the term occurs. Although the exact nature of Fregean senses might be open to endless debate, it is clear that the postulation for each name of a sense satisfying (i),(ii), and especially (iii) would … 
Takashi Yagisawa|The pseudo-Mates argument|Takashi Yagisawa|1984/8/1|The Philosophical Review|93|3|407-418||Belief sentences are supposed to present special difficulties for semantics. Modal sentences breed referentially opaque contexts, thus escaping purely extensional semantics. Possible worlds semantics is an alternative tailored to modal sentences. Belief sentences breed referential opacity, too. But apparently they are not susceptible to possible worlds semantics. For they apparently also breed semantic opacity: failure of salva veritate substitutivity of synonymous expressions, where synonymy is some stronger semantic relation than coextensiveness; for example, sameness of intuitive" meaning," which obtains, for instance, between'vixen'and'female fox'or between'groundhog'and'woodchuck'. Possible worlds semantics seems unable to deal with semantically opaque contexts. Indeed, is any semantics able to do so? Thus we supposedly have the" problem of semantics for belief sentences."

Takashi Yagisawa|Proper names as variables|Takashi Yagisawa|1984/7/1|Erkenntnis|21|2|195-208|Springer Netherlands|Proper names are usually given a special treatment in formal logic. Quine proposed a treatment of proper names in terms of such special predicates as' socratizes', representing'Socrates' by the definite description'the socratizer'. l A more standard way to represent proper names is to introduce a special set of symbols. Those symbols are called'individual constants' and governed by special semantic rules which assign them objects ad hoc, 2 or which, as in some intensional semantics, assign them a special kind of semantic values called'individual concepts'. 3 I contend that none of such special treatments is necessary. In fact, those special treatments obscure the nature of proper names; and in particular, they are incapable of providing a satisfactory semantics for negative existential sentences whose subject terms are proper names and sentences with vacuous proper names. Satisfactory accommodation of proper … 
Takashi Yagisawa|Primitive worlds|Takashi Yagisawa|2002/3/1|Acta Analytica|17|1|19|Springer Netherlands|Modal Dimensionalism is a metaphysical theory about possible worlds that is naturally suggested by the often-noted parallelism between modal logic and tense logic. It says that the universe spreads out not only in spatiotemporal dimensions but also in a modal dimension. It regards worlds as nothing more or less than indices in the modal dimension in the way analogous to the way in which Temporal Dimensionalism regards temporal points and intervals as indices in the temporal dimension. Despite its naturalness and intuitive appeal. Modal Dimensionalism has been largely ignored while the debates between David Lewis and his critics have dominated the discourse on the nature of possible worlds. It is high time that we took Modal Dimensionalism seriously as a viable alternative. 
Takashi Yagisawa|Possible worlds as shifting domains|Takashi Yagisawa|1992/1/1|Erkenntnis|36|1|83-101|Kluwer Academic Publishers|Those who object to David Lewis' modal realism express qualms about philosophical respectability of the Lewisian notion of a possible world and its correlate notion of an inhabitant of a possible world. The resulting impression is that these two notions either stand together or fall together. I argue that the Lewisian notion of a possible world is otiose even for a good Lewisian modal realist, and that one can carry out a good Lewisian semantics for modal discourse without Lewisian possible worls. I do so by generalizing Lewis' own idea that restrictions on quantification “come and go with the pragmatic wind” and relativizing possible worlds as shifting domains of discourse. I then suggest a way to soften the infamous “incredulous stare”.

Takashi Yagisawa|Modal space exploration: replies to Ballarin, Hayaki, and Kim|Takashi Yagisawa|2011/12|Analytic Philosophy|52|4|302-311|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|Roberta Ballarin does an admirably concise and accurate job of summarizing my complex views on worlds as modal indices and related issues. I would like to make one correction and offer a few clarifications. Ballarin thinks that I take the notion of impossibility (or possibility) as primitive. I do not. For any kind K of possibility, to say that P is K-possibly true is to say that P is true at some world at which the K-proprietary constraint on worlds holds (eg, the appropriate laws are true); and impossibility is defined as the denial of possibility. In these definitions, the heavy lifting is done by the notions of world, truth, and proprietary constraint. Ballarin is right in saying that I am motivated by taking temporal cases as central and developing a theory of worlds by analogy. As she puts it, very few people feel uneasy about times as entities. Like spatial regions, times are relativizers of things-being-thus-and-so. We have an intuitive and immediate understanding of times and spatial regions as such relativizers. I propose the same for worlds. They are a third kind of relativizers of things-being-thus-andso, and we intuitively and immediately grasp the difference between this kind and the other two kinds. It is the intuitiveness and immediacy that give an appearance of mysteriousness Ballarin attributes to times. I doubt that we can go beyond the intuitive and immediate understanding of times, or of worlds. Ballarin coins a wonderfully vivid term “double soul” to characterize my position. She is right in viewing my project as that of combining two apparently opposite views. She thinks that this results in a position that is doubly plagued with the disadvantages of the two views …

Takashi Yagisawa|Psychologism in Linguistics|TAKASHI Yagisawa|1989|Perspectives on Psychologism|1||458|BRILL|It seems utterly uncontroversial that linguistics is about actual human natural languages. Linguists may talk about various other things (eg, history, sociology, psychology, formal logic, computers, etc.) in the course of their investigations, and different branches of linguistics may be concerned with diversely different aspects of actual human natural languages. But it seems undeniably correct to say that the basic, core subject matter of linguistics is actual human natural languages. Thus, it seems undeniably correct to say that if actual human natural languages are (identical with) X, then linguistics is about X. Suppose this is so. The question then is: What are actual human natural languages? Actual human natural languages include Swahili, Russian, Mandarin, etc. Take English as an example. What is English? English consists of English expressions which are written and pronounced in certain ways and which have certain meanings. English expressions include'divine'meaning divine,'dog'meaning dog, and'Dogs are divine'meaning dogs are divine. I propose that we forget about meanings for our purposes (except in chapter XIV). Many people think that meanings are a funny kind of entities if they are entities. If they are not entities, what are they? There is no agreement among philosophers and linguists as to what meanings are and what relation it is that must hold between an expression and a meaning in order for that expression to have that meaning. I do not want to presuppose any particular theory on any of theses issues. So let us stay away from the swamp of meanings. 2 The rest of the ground is muddy enough. Let us start by asking ourselves … 
Takashi Yagisawa|Gluons of Different Colors|Takashi Yagisawa|2017/8/8||25|4|555-559|Routledge|Many bricks, when configured appropriately, constitute one house. How is it possible for plurality to yield unity? This is the metaphysical problem of unity. Introducing another thing, say, the configuration of the bricks, into the picture would not solve it, for the bricks plus the configuration are still plurality. This is the famous Bradley’s regress, as applied to the problem of unity. Something must unify the bricks, but it cannot be any additional thing on pain of Bradley’s regress. Therefore, Graham Priest (2014) infers, the metaphysical glue–called ‘gluon’by Priest–that unifies the bricks must be one of the bricks. I would like to offer a modest critique of Priest’s gluon theory. Let us say that three parts, a, b, and c, constitute one whole, h. Since a, b, and c are on a metaphysical par with one another, what accounts for the unity of h on Priest’s account is a gluon–call it ‘gp’–such that gp= a, gp= b, and gp= c. At the same time, a≠ b … 
Takashi Yagisawa|Deflationary existence|Takashi Yagisawa|2014/3/25|Annals of the Japan Association for Philosophy of Science|22||1-16|Japan Association for Philosophy of Science|I propose and defend a surprisingly simple yet useful analysis of existence, according to which existence is a relation between a thing and a set: a thing x bears the relation of existence to a set S if and only if x is a member of S. This simple set-theoretic analysis of existence demystifies existence and is powerful and flexible enough to serve important theoretical purposes. 
Takashi Yagisawa|Ghosts Are Chilly|WD Hart, Takashi Yagisawa|2007/1/25|Persons: Human and Divine: Human and Divine|||166|Clarendon Press|Much of the information about the nature of the mind revealed by this central argument for dualism shows up in working out its second premise, that you can imagine being disembodied. A responsible dualist should be able at least to sketch how causal interaction between mind and matter is possible. But causation is the flow of energy. ² So a dualist should sketch how energy might flow between mind and matter. For example, Paul Grice showed that vision requires that veridical visual experience be caused by that in virtue of which it is veridical. ³ To transpose Grice’s result into the disembodied mode, imagine that light rays reaching the region of convergence of a disembodied person’s lines of sight from that in virtue of which his visual experience is veridical lose some electromagnetic energy and, at a fixed rate of conversion, he acquires or is sustained in his degree of conviction as to how what he in fact sees is. ⁴ It is a corollary of this way of imagining 
Takashi Yagisawa|Modes of presentation?|Takashi Yagisawa|1993/1/1|Analysis|53|1|34-36|Analysis Committee, Oxford University Press|A popular version of (*) is the modes-of-presentation theory, according to which Rxpm just in case m is a mode of presentation of p for x and x accepts m as such. A mode of presentation and acceptance are theoretical notions. In a picturesque caricature of the simplest modes-of-presentation theory, viz., the Mentalese-token-in-a-box theory (MTB for short), m is a mode of presentation of p for x just in case m is a token sentence in x's Mentalese meaning p, and x accepts m just in case m is in x's belief box. Stephen Schiffer has criticized (*) in its various forms. I focus on one of Schiffer's criticisms of MTB. His criticism and my discussion of it obvi-ously generalize to cover other versions of modes-of-presentation theory.

Takashi Yagisawa|The Referential and the Attributive: A Distinction in Use?|Takashi Yagisawa|1985/2/1|The Southern Journal of Philosophy|23|1|109-125||There are two opposing views on the implications of Keith Donnellan's referential/attributive distinction (hereafter, the r/a distinction) concerning definite descriptions. The controversy centers on the question of whether the rla distinction gives rise to a corresponding distinction between two different truth conditions of the sentence uttered. Some say that it doesl and others say that it does not. 2 But it seems to be agreed that the rla distinction is at least a distinction between two different ways the speaker can use definite descriptions. On this assumption, the question is formulated as the question of whether the two uses so labelled are such that we should acknowledge two distinct truth conditions of the sentence uttered. 3 In this paper I propose to challenge this assumption. I wish to do so indirectly by arguing for two claims:(i) the rla distinction does not arise from a difference in speaker's meaning;(ii) if the rla distinction …

Takashi Yagisawa|BELIEF AND SYNONYMY.|Takashi Yagisawa|1982||||2721-2721||Degree: Ph. D. DegreeYear: 1981 Institute: Princeton University My general contention is to defend the compositional principle of meaning--that the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its parts (given the way they are combined)--with respect to belief contexts, which do not always appear to allow salva veritate substitutivity of synonyms. I argue that this appearance is an illusion which results from confusing beliefs that are not about linguistic expressions with beliefs that are about linguistic expressions. In doing so, I invoke and elaborate the Gricean distinction between what a sentence means and what the speaker means in using the sentence. 
Takashi Yagisawa|< 特別寄稿> Now is the Time|Takashi Yagisawa|2016|||||京都大学哲学論叢刊行会|I would like to sketch what may be called temporal perspectivalism. It is a metaphysical outlook which results from applying a broad stance in philosophical theorizing to the particular area of theorizing about matters of temporality. I endorse this broad stance, which may be called general perspectivalism, but shall focus just on temporal perspectivalism in this paper. I will make the best of the fruits of the so-called twodimensional formal semantics in tense logic but part company with this popular orthodoxy on the treatment of the present tense. I shall argue that the correct treatment of the present tense points to the essentially perspectival nature of our metaphysical theoretical position and sheds new light on an important theoretical issue in temporal metaphysics.

Takashi Yagisawa|Unrestricted Quantification and Reality: Reply to Kim|Takashi Yagisawa|2012/3/1|Acta Analytica|27|1|77-79|Springer Netherlands|In my book, Worlds and Individuals, Possible and Otherwise, I use the novel idea of modal tense to respond to a number of arguments against modal realism. Peter van Inwagen’s million-carat-diamond objection is one of them. It targets the version of modal realism by David Lewis and exploits the fact that Lewis accepts absolutely unrestricted quantification. The crux of my response is to use modal tense to neutralize absolutely unrestricted quantification. Seahwa Kim says that even when equipped with modal tense, I am unsuccessful, given my view of reality and the proper use of modal tense in speaking of reality. I counter her attempt at resurrecting van Inwagen’s objection and clarify how we should use modal tense and how we should talk about reality. 
Takashi Yagisawa|Précis of worlds and individuals, possible and otherwise|Takashi Yagisawa|2011/12|Analytic Philosophy|52|4|270-272|Blackwell Publishing Ltd|I present a version of modal realism and partially defend it. I regard this as the first of many steps in the development of nonactualist non-Lewisian modal realism. I define modal realism as the thesis that the nonactual, as well as the actual, are real. By the word “real,” I mean real. The notion of reality is primitive and absolutely essential to metaphysics. Different metaphysicians may have different names for reality, but any metaphysical theory worth its salt must be ultimately a study of reality. There is a competing and more popular conception of modal realism. It says that the nonactual, as well as the actual, exist. This conception conflates reality with existence. Modal realism should be a position that affirms the most fundamental status of the nonactual in metaphysics, and that status is none other than reality. Existence is not fundamental. It is a two-place relation: an object x exists relative to a collection C of objects iff x …

Meaning Holism is the thesis that it is not metaphysically possible for a state to be a meaningful state without many other states being meaningful states.^ Meaning Molecularism is the thesis that it is not metaphysically possible for a state to be a meaningful state without at least one other state being a meaningful state. Meaning Holism and Meaning Molecularism have received well-deserved attention and been examined at length.^ However, the third member of the triad, viz., Meaning Solipsism, has escaped comparable scrutiny so far. I wish to make a modest attempt at rectifying this situation.

Takashi Yagisawa|From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science: The Case against Belief.|Takashi Yagisawa|1985/6/1||19|2|288-294|Wiley|Heyd defines a supererogatory act (p. 115) as one that meets four conditions:(1) it is neither obligatory nor forbidden,(2) its omission it not wrong and does not deserve criticism,(3) it is morally good, both by virtue of its intended consequences and its intrinsic value, and (4) it is done voluntarily for the sake of certain intended consequences. This account cries out for analysis by some theory of action or practical reasoning. Heyd does not provide such a theory. But I think it sould be pointed out that his case for supererogation rests directly on the need for a theory of deliberation and action, and collapses without it. Heyd himself conceds (p. 115) that supererogation is primarily an attribute of actions. But his theory needs a further theory of how intentions are carried out in sequences of actions, if it is to become secure from worries about moral personalism.

When such a sentence is de re with respect to such a term, we say that the sentence ascribes to x a de re relation with y. There are two incompatible views concerning the necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of a belief sentence ascribing a de re relation. The first view claims that any de re relation to an object must be grounded on some special kind of confrontation with the object, eg, clear direct visual perception.

Let us begin by distinguishing it from a different notion which is often confused with it, namely the notion self. The notion me applies to me and me alone absolutely, whereas the notion self applies to me relative to me, applies to you relative to you, applies to Jill relative to Jill, applies to Jack relative to Jack, and so on. Everyone is the self relative to her/him; for every x, x is the self to x. 1 But only I am me, period. Of course, you may assert correctly,“Only I am me.” But the content of your assertion when you say this does not deal in the notion me; for your word “me” does not express the notion me. Only my word “me” does. It is not even that your word “me” expresses the notion me to you. To you your word “me” expresses a certain notion, which you call “the notion me.” But what you call “the notion me” is not the notion me, any more than the person you call “me” is me.

Mitchell Herschbach|Folk psychological and phenomenological accounts of social perception|Mitchell Herschbach|2008/9/1|Philosophical Explorations|11|3|223-235|Routledge|Theory theory and simulation theory share the assumption that mental states are unobservable, such that mental state attribution requires an extra psychological step beyond perception. Phenomenologists deny this, contending that we can directly perceive people's mental states. Here I evaluate objections to theory theory and simulation theory as accounts of everyday social perception offered by Dan Zahavi and Shaun Gallagher. I agree that their phenomenological claims have bite at the personal level, distinguishing direct social perception from conscious theorizing and simulation. Their appeals to phenomenology and other arguments do not, however, rule out theory theory or simulation theory as accounts of the sub-personal processes underlying social perception. While I here remain uncommitted about the plausibility of sub-personal theorizing and simulation, I argue that phenomenologists must do more in … 
Mitchell Herschbach|Social cognition: mindreading and alternatives|Daniel D Hutto, Mitchell Herschbach, Victoria Southgate|2011/9/1|Review of Philosophy and Psychology|2|3|375|Springer Netherlands|Human beings, even very young infants, and members of several other species, exhibit remarkable capacities for attending to and engaging with others. These basic capacities have been the subject of intense research in developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, comparative psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind over the last several decades. Appropriately characterizing the exact level and nature of these abilities and what lies at their basis continues to prove a tricky business. The contributions to this special issue investigate whether and to what extent the exercise of such capacities count as, or are best explained by, a genuine understanding of minds, where such understanding depends on the creatures in question possessing capacities for attributing a range of mental states and their contents in systematic ways. The question that takes center stage is: Do the capacities for attending to and … 
Mitchell Herschbach|On the role of social interaction in social cognition: a mechanistic alternative to enactivism|Mitchell Herschbach|2012|Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|||1-20|Springer Netherlands|Researchers in the enactivist tradition have recently argued that social interaction can constitute social cognition, rather than simply serve as the context for social cognition. They contend that a focus on social interaction corrects the overemphasis on mechanisms inside the individual in the explanation of social cognition. I critically assess enactivism’s claims about the explanatory role of social interaction in social cognition. After sketching the enactivist approach to cognition in general and social cognition in particular, I identify problems with an enactivist taxonomy of roles for social interaction in the explanation of social cognition (contextual, enabling, and constitutive). In particular, I show that this enactivist taxonomy does not clearly distinguish between enabling conditions and constitutive elements, which would make them in danger of committing the coupling-constitution fallacy found in some attempts to … 
Mitchell Herschbach|False-belief understanding and the phenomenological critics of folk psychology|Mitchell Herschbach|2008|Journal of Consciousness Studies|15|12|33-56|Imprint Academic|The dominant account of human social understanding is that we possess a 'folk psychology', that we understand and can interact with other people because we appreciate their mental states. Recently, however, philosophers from the phenomenological tradition have called into question the scope of the folk psychological account and argued for the importance of 'online', non-mentalistic forms of social understanding. In this paper I critically evaluate the arguments of these phenomenological critics, arguing that folk psychology plays a larger role in human social understanding than the critics suggest. First, I use standard false-belief tasks to spell out the commitments of the folk psychological picture. Next, I explicate the critics' account in terms of Michael Wheeler's distinction between online and offline intelligence. I then demonstrate the challenge that false-belief understanding -- a paradigm case of mental state … 
Mitchell Herschbach|Philosophy of the cognitive sciences|William Bechtel, Mitchell Herschbach|2010/1/4|Philosophy of the Sciences|||239-261||Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary research endeavor focusing on human cognitive phenomena such as memory, language use, and reasoning. It emerged in the second half of the 20th century and is charting new directions at the beginning of the 21st century. This chapter begins by identifying the disciplines that contribute to cognitive science and reviewing the history of the interdisciplinary engagements that characterize it. The second section examines the role that mechanistic explanation plays in cognitive science, while the third focuses on the importance of mental representations in specifically cognitive explanations. The fourth section considers the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science and explores how multiple disciplines can contribute to explanations that exceed what any single discipline might accomplish. The conclusion sketches some recent developments in cognitive science and their implications for philosophers. 
Mitchell Herschbach|Mirroring versus simulation: on the representational function of simulation|Mitchell Herschbach|2012/12/1|Synthese|189|3|483-513|Springer Netherlands|Mirror neurons and systems are often appealed to as mechanisms enabling mindreading, i.e., understanding other people’s mental states. Such neural mirroring processes are often treated as instances of mental simulation rather than folk psychological theorizing. I will call into question this assumed connection between mirroring and simulation, arguing that mirroring does not necessarily constitute mental simulation as specified by the simulation theory of mindreading. I begin by more precisely characterizing “mirroring” (Sect. 2) and “simulation” (Sect. 3). Mirroring results in a neural process in an observer that resembles a neural process of the same type in the observed agent.

The direct perception of mental states has been formulated phenomenologically and psychologically, and typically restricted to the mental state types of intentions and emotions. I will compare DSP to another account of mindreading: dual process accounts that posit a fast, automatic “Type 1” form of mindreading and a slow, effortful “Type 2” form. I will here analyze whether dual process accounts’ Type 1 mindreading serves as a rival to DSP or whether some Type 1 mindreading can be perceptual. I will focus on Apperly and Butterfill’s dual process account of mindreading epistemic states such as perception, knowledge, and belief. This account posits a minimal form of Type 1 mindreading of belief-like states called registrations. I will argue that general dual process theories fit well with a modular view of … 
Mitchell Herschbach|The phenomenological critics of folk psychology: The case of false belief|Mitchell Herschbach|2007/4|Berkeley-Stanford-Davis Graduate Student Conference|14||||The dominant account of human social understanding is that we possess a “folk psychology”: that we can understand and interact with other people because we have a commonsense understanding of their mental states. However, recently a group of philosophers from the phenomenological tradition have called into question the folk psychological account of human social understanding. I will first explicate the “phenomenological critics’” account of social understanding, making use of Michael Wheeler’s distinction between online and offline intelligence. I will then discuss recent studies of early false belief understanding, and identify ways it supports and ways it challenges the critics’ account. 
Mitchell Herschbach|Mental Mechanisms and Psychological Construction|Mitchell Herschbach, William Bechtel|2014||||21-44|Guilford Press|Psychological construction represents an important new approach to psychological phenomena, one that has the promise to help us reconceptualize the mind both as a behavioral and as a biological system. It has so far been developed in the greatest detail for emotion, but it has important implications for how researchers approach other mental phenomena such as reasoning, memory, and language use. Its key contention is that phenomena that are characterized in (folk) psychological vocabulary are not themselves basic features of the mind, but are constructed from more basic psychological operations. The framework of mechanistic explanation, currently under development in philosophy of science, can provide a useful perspective on the psychological construction approach. A central insight of the mechanistic account of explanation is that biological and psychological phenomena result from mechanisms in which component parts and operations do not individually exhibit the phenomena of interest but function together in an orchestrated and sometimes in a complex dynamical manner to generate it. While at times acknowledging the compatibility of the mechanist approach with constructionist approach (Lindquist, Wager, Kober, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett, 2012), proponents of the constructionist approach have at other times pitched their approach as anti-mechanist. For example, Barrett (2009) claims that the psychological constructionist approach rejects machines as the primary metaphor for understanding the mind, instead favoring a recipe metaphor; constructionism also purportedly rejects the “mechanistic” picture of causation, which it …

Mitchell Herschbach|The concept of simulation in control-theoretic accounts of motor control and action perception|Mitchell Herschbach|2008|Proceedings of the 30th annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society|||315-20|Cognitive Science Society|Control theory is a popular theoretical framework for explaining cognitive domains such as motor control and “mindreading.” Such accounts frequently characterize their “internal models” as “simulating” things outside the brain. But in what sense are these “simulations”? Do they involve the kind of “replication” simulation (R-simulation) found in the simulation theory of mindreading (Goldman, 2006)? I will argue that some but not all control-theoretic appeals to “simulation” involve R-simulation. To do so, I examine in detail a recent computational model of motor control and action perception based in control theory (Oztop et al., 2005). I argue that the architecture does not use R-simulation during motor control, but does during action perception. A novel result of this analysis is that the forward model—the controltheoretic mechanism most often described as performing simulation—is not well characterized in terms of R-simulation. I conclude with some lessons for research on the mechanisms of mindreading. 
Mitchell Herschbach|Critical Note: How Revisionary are 4E Accounts of Social Cognition?|Mitchell Herschbach|2018||||513-525|Oxford University Press|I argue that the chapters in this section only modestly challenge the “traditional min-dreading account,” which sees the capacity for mental state attribution as central to human social cognition. This internalist, cognitivist account has already been refined in recent years to give greater attention to unreflective, dynamic social interaction and non-mindreading processes. The chapters here support a kind of embodied social cognition that does not involve mindreading. They also support the idea that an embedded/situated cognition perspective can inform the nature of the mindread-ing and non-mindreading forms of social cognition, particularly their use during dynamic social interaction. Further, important empirical questions arise about the importance of social interaction in the development of mindreading. But the more radical extended cognition thesis only appears sporadically and is weakly defended. Thus, the 4E perspective represented here does not challenge the importance of the “representation-hungry,” internal capacity for mindreading. 
Mitchell Herschbach|Beyond folk psychology?: toward an enriched account of social understanding|Mitchell Albert Herschbach|2010||||||Folk psychology is the ability to interpret people's mental states (beliefs, desires, etc.) and use this information to explain and predict their behavior. While folk psychology has traditionally been seen as fundamental to human social understanding, philosophers drawing on the phenomenological tradition have recently argued that most of our everyday social interactions do not involve folk psychology. I defend the role of folk psychology in human social understanding against these phenomenological critics. I argue that we need not abandon the folk psychological picture to heed the central claims of these phenomenological critics. In so doing, I develop an enriched account of human social understanding that accepts their descriptions of the phenomena of human social understanding while retaining a significant role for folk psychological reasoning at the subpersonal level. In chapter 1 I describe the traditional folk psychological account of social understanding and the challenge to it raised by these critics. Since it assumes folk psychology is pervasive, the traditional philosophical and empirical research on human social understanding focuses on the psychological processes by which we attribute mental states : whether we apply theoretical knowledge about human psychology, as proposed by the theory theory, and/or use own psychological mechanisms to "simulate" other people's mental states, as the simulation theory suggests. Two central claims made by the phenomenological critics against this traditional picture are: (i) that some mental state understanding occurs by "direct perception," without the need for theorizing or simulation; and (ii) that …

Leemon McHenry|Whitehead and Bradley: a comparative analysis|Leemon B McHenry|1992|||||SUNY Press|In his magnum opus, Process and Reality, Alfred North Whitehead claims a special affinity to Oxford philosopher Francis Herbert Bradley. McHenry clarifies exactly how much of Whitehead's metaphysics is influenced by and accords with the main principles of Bradley's" absolute idealism." He argues that many of Whitehead's doctrines cannot be understood without an adequate understanding of Bradley, in terms of both affinities and contrasts. He evaluates the arguments between them and explores several important connections with William James, Josiah Royce, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell, and Charles Hartshorne. 
Leemon McHenry|Conflicted medical journals and the failure of trust|Jon N Jureidini, Leemon B McHenry|2011/1/31|Accountability in research|18|1|45-54|Taylor & Francis Group|Journals are failing in their obligation to ensure that research is fairly represented to their readers, and must act decisively to retract fraudulent publications.

But scant attention has been given to the role that journals play in this process, especially when evidence of research fraud fails to elicit corrective measures.

The now-infamous Study 329 of paroxetine in adolescent depression was negative for efficacy on all eight protocol-specified outcomes and positive for harm, but JAACAP published a report of this study that concluded that “paroxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.” The journal's …

RESULTS: The published article contained efficacy and safety data inconsistent with the protocol criteria. Procedural deviations went unreported imparting statistical significance to the primary outcome, and an implausible effect size was claimed; positive post hoc measures were introduced and negative secondary outcomes were not reported; and adverse events were misleadingly analysed.

This trend results from a business model of education, which I identify as profit-based inquiry. I contrast profit-based inquiry with Nicholas Maxwell's conception of wisdom-based inquiry and conclude that the business model fails to achieve enduring value and results in a promotional or ideological emphasis rather than one that stresses the importance of critical rationalism. In order to make my case for this failure, I focus attention on the current state of commercialization in research of medicines.

While I do not deny that important influences from physics and biology helped Whitehead frame his idea, I contend that prehension only makes sense as a concept of panpsychistic idealism.

Both produced systems of thought that have taken philosophy in two completely different directions. Quine's thought has remained at the forefront of contemporary analytic philosophy for the better part of the 20th century, while Whitehead's influence has been reserved for a relatively small number of devotees who have cut their own path. With regard to the latter, Anthony Quinton has remarked:" Outside the sequestered province of the cult, Whitehead is regarded with a nleasure of baffled reverence, mingled with suspicion." 1 While Whitehead was clearly nlade of" the right stuff," says Quinton, his philosophical writings have been utterly incomprehensible to the general philosophical community. In this paper, I make a case for a number of common themes between …

Leemon McHenry|Descriptive and revisionary theories of events|Leemon B McHenry|1996/7/1|Process Studies|25||90-103||Early in this century, three Cambridge philosophers, AN Whitehead, Bertrand Russell and CD Broad, became champions of event ontologies that were thought to be compatible with emerging relativity theory. l Events, therefore, replaced Aristotelian substances as the primary constituents of the universe---they are conceived as units of space-time spreading throughout and overlapping within the electromagnetic field. As modem physics advanced, event ontologies seemed to gain further support from the un-thing-like behavior of elementary particles described in the peculiarities of the quantum world. From the expansion of the universe to the trajectories of subatomic particles, it appears that everything can be systematically interpreted in terms of events. This view involves a radical revision of oUf common sense conceptual framework, ie, our ordinary view of the world as composed of enduring material objects …

But there is perhaps no place to see the central flaw of such interpretations better than in academic medicine, for here the importance of reliable reporting of the data from empirical testing reveals clearly the distinction between genuine and sham science. In his paper ‘Ghosts in the Machine: Publication Planning in the Medical Sciences’, Sergio Sismondo (2009) exposes the larger background of marketing and promotional activities in the vast network of pharmaceutical industry ghostwriting. By having infiltrated the ranks of marketers he brings a unique perspective to their activities, and his report on this experience is valuable. Outside of litigation one seldom … 
Leemon McHenry|Sprigge's ontology of consciousness|Leemon McHenry|2010/10|Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplements|67||5-20|Cambridge University Press|Timothy Sprigge advanced an original synthesis of panpsychism and absolute idealism. He argued that consciousness is an irreducible, subjective reality that is only grasped by an introspective, phenomenological approach and constructed his ontology from what is revealed in the phenomenology. In defending the unique place of metaphysics in the pursuit of truth, he claimed that scientific investigation can never discover the essence of consciousness since it can only provide descriptions of structure and function in what we normally think of as physical existence. In this paper I present a critical evaluation of Sprigge's view focusing in particular on his conception of the nature of scientific inquiry vis-à-vis the ambitious project of his metaphysics. I argue that a naturalistic metaphysics provides a more adequate approach to the relation between science and metaphysics. 
Leemon McHenry|Biomedical research and corporate interests: a question of academic freedom|Leemon McHenry|2008/1|Mens sana monographs|6|1|146|Wolters Kluwer--Medknow Publications|The current situation in medicine has been described as a crisis of credibility, as the profit motive of industry has taken control of clinical trials and the dissemination of data. Pharmaceutical companies maintain a stranglehold over the content of medical journals in three ways:(1) by ghostwriting articles that bias the results of clinical trials,(2) by the sheer economic power they exert on journals due to the purchase of drug advertisements and journal reprints, and (3) by the threat of legal action against those researchers who seek to correct the misrepresentation of study results. This paper argues that Karl Popper's critical rationalism provides a corrective to the failure of academic freedom in biomedical research. 
Leemon McHenry|Quine's Pragmatic Ontology|Leemon B McHenry|1995/1/1|The Journal of Speculative Philosophy|||147-158|Pennsylvania State University Press|Quine has occupied a place at the center of analytic philosophy for more than five decades. As the doyen of this school, he has provided shape and direction to what is arguably the dominant philosophical movement of the twentieth century. But Quine has also incorporated various elements of pragmatic thought into his philosophical outlook, and he has often been interpreted as a contemporary adaptation of the American pragmatist movement that originated with Peirce, James, and Dewey. In what fol lows, I explore the extent of Quine's commitment to pragmatism by inves tigating his views on ontology and the criteria for theory selection. While pragmatism clearly plays an important role in this context, I will show that this does not provide a sufficient basis for classifying his work with the early pragmatists or with recent revivals of pragmatism. Quine's pragmatic leanings are often traced to his celebrated paper of 1951 …

Steven Weinberg, for example, in Dreams of a Final Theory (New York. Pantheon, 1992), says that the philosophy of science is at best" a pleasing gloss on the history and discoveries of science. But we should not expect it to provide today's scientists with any useful guidance about how to go about their work or about what they are likely to find". He adds,"... I know of no one who has participated actively in the advance of physics in the postwar period whose research has been significantly helped by the work of philosophers"(pp. 167-69). Modifying an analogy from Barnett Newman concerning the relation between aesthetics and art, Weinberg's point can be stated concisely: philosophy is to science as ornithology is to the birds. 
Leemon McHenry|The multiverse conjecture: Whitehead’s cosmic epochs and contemporary cosmology|Leemon McHenry|2011/4/1|Process Studies|40|1|5-24||Recent developments in cosmology and particle physics have led to speculation that our universe is merely one of a multitude of universes. While this notion, the multiverse hypothesis, is highly contested as legitimate science, it has nonetheless struck many physicists as a necessary consequence of the effort to construct a final, unified theory. In Process and Reality (1929), his magnum opus, Alfred North Whitehead advanced a cosmology as part of his general metaphysics of process. Part of this project involved a theory of cosmic epochs which bears a remarkable affinity to current cosmological speculation. This paper demonstrates how the basic framework of a multiverse theory is already present in Whitehead’s cosmology and defends the necessity of speculation in the quest for an explanatory description. 
Leemon McHenry|la mercantilización del saber: influencias mercantiles en la búsqueda del conocimiento|Leemon B McHENRY|2010||||||La universidad del siglo XXI ha perdido el rumbo. Pilotada como está por un modelo empresarial de investigación y docencia, ya no puede pretender seguir siendo el guardián de la verdad y el conocimiento. Los orígenes de esta lamentable situación se remontan a los años ochenta cuando cambió la tendencia demográfica de los estudiantes que accedían a la universidad en los Estados Unidos y las instituciones educativas empezaron a competir por una población estudiantil cada vez más reducida, presentándose ellas mismas como orientadas al mercado (Krimsky, 2006). Por la misma época, el marco legal ofrecía la posibilidad de que se asociasen las instituciones académicas y el mundo empresarial, lo que dio lugar a partir de los años noventa a la aparición del hombre de negocios académico, que buscaba subvenciones y honorarios por consultorías y con relaciones económicas orientadas a la búsqueda de beneficio.'Las administraciones universitarias acogieron con los brazos abiertos la implantación de modelos de gestión como el «TQM»(total quality management,«gestión de calidad total») e instaron a sus profesores a que hiciesen su especialidad tan atractiva como pudiesen para sus «clientes estudiantes».'No es del todo raro encontrar en tales instituciones a un vendedor de alfombras como rector de la universidad o que el salario del entrenador de fútbol supere con mucho el presupuesto total de un departamento de humanidades.

We constantly refer to the pageant of history and its rel evance to the events that constitute our present. But what guarantees the truth or falsehood of our judgments about past events, if they are long gone? On this score, it matters little whether we refer to the truth of Caesar's death on the Ides of March, the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, or Kyle's birthday party on the day before I write this sen tence. The fact of the matter is that the past is past irrespective of the span of time that has lapsed up to the present moment. Thus, the ques tion I wish to consider is sharply focused on the ontological basis for our judgments about the past and not the skeptical problem of how we can know things about the past. Ancient relics, memories, and footprints in the sand … 
Leemon McHenry|Quine and Whitehead on ontological reduction: properties reconsidered|Christine Holmgren, Leemon McHenry|2012/10/1|Process Studies|41|2|261-286||WVO Quine and AN Whitehead shared a dualistic ontology of concrete and abstract objects but differed sharply on the status of properties. In this essay, we explore Whitehead’s reasons for admitting properties into his ontology and Quine’s objections. In the course of examining Quine’s position we demonstrate some deficiencies in his position and conclude that in spite of his claims, neither space-time coordinate systems nor classes can do all the ontological work of properties. 
Leemon McHenry|Industry-corrupted psychiatric trials|Jay D Amsterdam, Leemon B McHenry, Jon N Jureidini|2017/12/30|Psychiatr. Pol|51|6|993-1008||The goal of this paper is to expose the research misconduct of pharmaceutical industrysponsored clinical trials via three short case studies of corrupted psychiatric trials that were conducted in the United States. We discuss the common elements that enable the misrepresentation of clinical trial results including ghostwriting for medical journals, the role of key opinion leaders as co-conspirators with the pharmaceutical industry and the complicity of top medical journals in failing to uphold standards of science and peer review. We conclude that the corruption of industry-sponsored clinical trials is one of the major obstacles facing evidence-based medicine. 
Leemon McHenry|Privatization of knowledge and the creation of biomedical conflicts of interest|Leemon B McHenry|2009|||||McMaster University|Scientific and ethical misconduct have increased at an alarming rate as a result of the privatization of knowledge. What began as an effort to stimulate entrepreneurship and increase discovery in biomedical research by strengthening the ties between industry and academics has led to an erosion of confidence in the reporting of research results. Inherent tensions between profit-directed inquiry and knowledge-directed inquiry are instantiated in psychopharmacology, especially in the co-option of academic activity to corporate objectives. The effects of these tensions are visible in research agendas, publication practices, postgraduate education, academic-industry partnerships and product promotion.

His writings have enlightened and envigorated scores of students and fellow interpreters of Whitehead since the early 1940's. After studying with Whitehead at Harvard and writing his Ph. D. thesis on Alexander, Russell and Whitehead, Lowe produced numerous articles and reviews on Whitehead, Peirce, James, CI Lewis, Alexander and Bergson; with Robert Baldwin he compiled the bibliography of Whitehead's writings for the volume in the The Library of Living Philosophers1 y wrote Encyclopedia and Dictionary entires on Whitehead2, and concentrated on the development and compre-hensive spectrum of Whitehead's thought in his first book, Under-standing Whitehead.* Since 1965 he had been working on White-head's intellectual … 
Leemon McHenry|The Axiomatic Matrix of Whitehead’s Process and Reality|Leemon B McHenry|1986/8/1|Process studies|15|3|172-180||Commentators on Whitehead's philosophy often mention his mathematical background as a foundation for his metaphysics. Rarely, however, do they explain just how the rigorous and technical expertise of his early work finds its relevant applications in his later cosmological framework. Nor do they explain his strenuous objections to philosophers following the pattern ofmathematical method ifindeed he did so hirnself. Though the particular structure and procedure of Process and Reality appear to be quite a divergence from most philosophic exposition, Whitehead here achieves a system which requires at least a moderate understanding ofthe mathematician's construction. It is just this structural similarity between Whitehead's celebrated work with Bertrand RusselI, Principia Mathematica, and his mature metaphysics developed in Process and Reality that I wish to investigate in this paper. 
Leemon McHenry|Analytical Critiques of Whitehead's Metaphysics|Leemon B Mchenry, George W Shields|2016|Journal of the American Philosophical Association|2|3|483-503|Cambridge University Press|Analytic philosophers have criticized A. N. Whitehead's metaphysics for being obscure, yet several such philosophers have espoused positions in metaphysics and philosophy of mind that were advanced by Whitehead in the 1920s. In this paper, we evaluate the merits and demerits of these criticisms by Bertrand Russell, W. V. Quine, Karl Popper, and others and then demonstrate the affinities and contrasts in the positions advanced by Galen Strawson, David Chalmers, Thomas Nagel, and Whitehead regarding so-called ‘analytic panexperientialism’. 
Leemon McHenry|Of Brahmins and Dalits in the academic caste system|Leemon McHenry, Paul W Sharkey|2014/1/1|Academe|100|1|35-38|American Association of University Professors|Traditionally, the three-pronged mission of our colleges and universities has been to provide high-quality education, encourage cutting-edge research, and promote professional and community service. The substitution of business-based policies for sound academic principles, however, has institutionalized a form of professional inequality that threatens all three. The growing distinction between tenured and tenure-track faculty members on the one hand and tenure-ineligible lecturers or part-time adjuncts on the other has produced an academic caste system that is undermining the raison d’être of our institutions of higher learning. This system is capricious, discriminatory, and unjust. What once constituted an occasional feature of a college’s or university’s faculty—a professional musician teaching a part-time violin course, a practicing attorney offering an evening course in the philosophy of law, or a faculty member choosing to teach part-time to accommodate family responsibilities—has become the norm rather than the exception, undermining shared governance and academic freedom. The cut-costs-at-all-costs policy of reducing tenured positions by replacing them with non-tenure-track appointments may allow some new PhDs to gain teaching experience, but it frequently earns them “careers” of interminable professional frustration rather than hoped-for recognition as scholars. The corporatization of the university is the root cause of this undesirable state of affairs. The very same agenda that replaced deans and presidents with business managers and fundraisers has also replaced a once-honored majority of tenured and tenure-track faculty … 
Leemon McHenry|Extension and the Theory of the Physical Universe|Leemon McHenry|2008||||||In this chapter I provide an elementary exposition of the development of Whitehead's view of objectivity and his theory of extension, with particular focus on explaining how macroscopic objects of ordinary perception and the whole structure of space-time arise out of the units of his ontology, namely, the actual occasions. I also review the scholarship on Whitehead's view of extension and discuss the major problems that arise in connection with the theory in his magnum opus, Process and Reality.

We start, in 2007, with the review of a book that was published in 2004. Why? Simply because this is a review that has been lying with three prestigious journals, awaiting publication, for nearly two years. Two of them initially accepted the review for publication but later backed out, citing some reason or the other. The third accepted but had a huge backlog. When we are putting the pharmaceutical industry under the scanner in this issue, in all fairness, we must also look at our own sins of omission and commission. When journals fight the good fight to ensure patient welfare and research integrity, they must not forget the wisdom of the old adage,'Physician, heal thyself.' It is not just the pharmaceutical industry that stymies publication of unfavourable articles. Journals may be equally guilty. Articles may be refused publication because of the journal's editorial …

Leemon McHenry|Naturalized and pure metaphysics: a reply to Hutto|Leemon McHenry|1998/4/1|Bradley Studies|4|1|97-101||There is perhaps no other branch of philosophy that has suffered as much scom and ridicule as metaphysics. With bruised ego and much the worse for wear, it always re-emerges as methodologies become fatigued and the discussion of the central questions within exhausts itself. Even Bradley, the doyen of what was believed to be a metaphysics finished once and for all, can regain his place in the pantheon along side the likes of Plato, Descartes and Spinoza. Following the lead of Peirce, James, and Dewey, however, philosophers in this century inclined to a more naturalist and pragmatist approach to metaphysics have sought to secure its importance and relevance within science. In this manner, what I called'naturalized metaphysics' is not so easily dismissed as grandiose, armchair speculation detached from the overall advance of knowledge. J Metaphysics thus conceived is a type of superscience but it evolves … 
Leemon McHenry|Bradley, James, and Whitehead on Relations|LEEMON B McHENRY|1989/1/1|The Journal of Speculative Philosophy|||149-169|Pennsylvania State University Press|FH Bradley has made a name for himself in Western philosophic thought for his rigorous criticism of relations, and for his insistence that the self contradictory character of relational thought must lead to the acceptance of a non-relational Absolute. On the other hand, William James and Alfred North Whitehead have advanced, in their own ways, novel forms of metaphysical pluralism in which concrete relatedness becomes the essen tial defining characteristic of each actuality in a creative universe. In this paper I will expose the thrust of Bradley's arguments against the reality of relations, and then argue that the solution to the problem finds a sound basis in Whitehead's process metaphysics. In the course of evaluating Bradley's arguments, I shall have recourse to some of the debates between him, James and Russell early in this century. The results of these arguments have become central to the formulation of process … 
Leemon McHenry|Academic Publishing and Scientific Integrity: Case Studies of Editorial Interference by Taylor & Francis|Bart Kahr, Leemon B McHenry, Mark D Hollingsworthiii|2019||||||Editorial independence is a bedrock principle of academic publishing. The growing domination of academic publishing by large, for-profit corporations threatens this independence. There is alarming evidence that large companies too often serve their own business interests and those of powerful clients rather than serving the scientific community and the general public. This evidence includes the publication of infelicitous commercial science and concealing scientific misconduct. We present two case studies in which the UK-based publisher Taylor & Francis interfered in the editorial process by blocking publication of legitimate criticism that had been reviewed and approved for publication by its specialized editors. The integrity of science depends in part on the transparency and intellectual honesty of all stakeholders. The widelyacknowledged inadequacies of English libel law are reviewed as context for some of Taylor & Francis’s fearful decisions.

But the antithetical relationship between these two warring factions is less apparent when we examine the common goals shared by Whitehead and Russell just after their collaboration on the foundations of mathematics in their monumental Principia Mathematica. 2 It was here that both were engaged in another foundational project in the philosophy of physics. Whitehead and Russell separately developed an event ontology as the most obvious consequence of the revolutionary advances of modern physics, but there were differences in their respective views as to how this ontology was to be interpreted as a metaphysical …

Leemon McHenry|The Philosophy of Evidence-Based Medicine by Jeremy Howick|Leemon McHenry|2017||27|3|E-1-E-5|Johns Hopkins University Press|The idea that prescribing physicians should be guided by the most reliable scientific evidence seems obvious, but the actual methodology of evidencebased medicine was only introduced in the early 1990s by an international group of clinicians and researchers led by Gordon Guyatt. Since then it has provided a new paradigm for the scientific foundation of medicine and has influenced other disciplines outside of medicine, for example, evidence-based psychotherapy, science and government. The novel concept of evidence-based medicine is based on hierarchies of evidence from opinions of respected authorities, mechanistic reasoning (pathophysiologic rationale), and reports of expert committees at the bottom to various levels of observational studies and finally to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) at the apex of the pyramid. Since RCTs provide the most rigorous testing of therapies, they are the gold standard …

When Bayer’s Cutter Laboratories realized that their blood products, Factor VIII and IX or antihemophiliac factor (AHF), were contaminated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the financial investment in the product was considered too high to destroy the inventory. Cutter misrepresented the results of its own research and sold the contaminated AHF to overseas markets in Asia and Latin America without the precaution of heat treating the product recommended for eliminating the risk. As a consequence, hemophiliacs who infused the HIV-contaminated Factor VIII and IX tested positive for HIV and developed AIDS. 
Leemon McHenry|Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time by Tim Maudlin|Leemon McHenry|2012/10/1|Process Studies|41|2|349-353||The modern theory of relativity has opened the possibility of a new answer to this question.... The whole investigation is based on the principle that the scientific concepts of space and time are the first outcome of the simplest generalizations from experience, and that they are not to be looked for at the tail end of a welter of differential equations.(v-vi) Whitehead was a physicist-philosopher who did not lose sight of the importance of clarity on foundational questions. In this review, I therefore focus on three points of contact between Maudlin and Whitehead:(1) the criticism that Newtonian mechanics had displaced physics from its empirical foundations;(2) that with the rise of the theory of relativity, a new ontology of events replaced the ancient trinity of time, space, and matter; and (3) a new geometry of space-time was required to explain the full ontological import of relativity.

Leemon McHenry|Whitehead's multiverse|Leemon B McHenry|2012|||||Modern Cosmology Associates|Alfred North Whitehead advanced a version of multiverse theory in 19291 that bears a remarkable affinity to the revolutionary ideas of current cosmological speculation. He postulated his theory for some of the very same reasons as those advanced today by leading cosmologists and physicists such as Martin Rees, Lee Smolin, Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark and Steven Weinberg, but his theory has largely gone unnoticed. While Whitehead knew nothing of the great advances in big bang theory, expansion, inflation and the unification of physics in post-Hubble cosmology when he wrote Process and Reality in the 1920s, he sought to explain the origin of our universe from its predecessor and to unify the fragmentary theories of physics into a grand theory.

Leemon McHenry|Conflicted Medical Journals and the Failure of Trust|Leemon McHenry, Jon Jureidini|2011||||||Journals are failing in their obligation to ensure that research is fairly represented to their readers, and must act decisively to retract fraudulent publications. Recent case reports have exposed how marketing objectives usurped scientific testing and compromised the credibility of academic medicine. But scant attention has been given to the role that journals play in this process, especially when evidence of research fraud fails to elicit corrective measures. Our experience with The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (JAACAP) illustrates the nature of the problem. The now-infamous Study 329 of paroxetine in adolescent depression was negative for efficacy on all eight protocol-specified outcomes and positive for harm, but JAACAP published a report of this study that concluded that “paroxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.” The journal’s editors not only failed to exercise critical judgment in accepting the paper, but when shown evidence that the paper misrepresented the science, refused either to convey this information to the medical community or to retract the article.

Leemon McHenry|Consciousness and Morality in the Philosophy of TLS Sprigge|Leemon McHenry|2010/1/1|journal of speculative philosophy|24|2|121-137|Pennsylvania State University Press|TLS Sprigge produced an eclectic yet highly original system of metaphysics and ethics, a synthesis of panpsychism, absolute idealism, and utilitarianism, at a time in which orthodox analytical philosophy could only view this system as an anachronism of the nineteenth century. His critics claim that his philosophy has only historical interest to a small group of specialists in the relatively dormant tradition of British Idealism, that an attempt to defend his view of consciousness is a hopeless nonstarter, and that his Spinozistic monism can have no relevance in our intellectual culture. 1 Yet others have defended Sprigge as the “most independent of thinkers within the field of metaphysics” and salute him as “a true philosopher who has significantly enriched the present state of philosophy by his courageous odd-ballism” and “for serving as a model for others who have felt themselves uncomfortably bound by the sterile …

He was the last of the great British Idealists beginning with George Berkeley and continuing into the nineteenth century with FH Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet, Edward Caird and TH Green. I say the ‘last idealist’of this tradition because Sprigge was certainly an anomaly in the twentieth century. His actual birth date of 14 January 1932 was just exactly a hundred years off the mark, for his thought and character were distinctively that of a nineteenth century English gentleman who wrote philosophy in the grand style of an Absolute Idealist. He also appreciated and was much influenced by American philosophers of this period as well.

That anyone of his generation succeeded in doing so against the tide of analytical philosophy in Britain is a feat in itself. His latest book is a superb study of Spinoza, Hegel, Kierkegaard, TH Green, Bosanquet, Royce, Whitehead, and Hartshorne, that then concludes with a defense of his own pantheistic idealism. What links these systems together is that each (except Kierkegaard) provides a case for a religious view of the world based on rational or would-be rational argument (vii). The notion that a serious religious perspective requires a metaphysical foundation is denied by Pascal, Kierkegaard, and James. From the outset, it is puzzling why the likes of Green, Royce, and Bosanquet are included in this study rather than Anselm, Aquinas, and Descartes. Sprigge says Anselm and other philosophers of the Middle Ages are excluded on the basis that they were Christian apologists …

Leemon McHenry|Consciousness, Reality and Value: Philosophical Essays in Honour of TLS Sprigge|Leemon McHenry, Pierfrancesco Basile|2007||||||In this Festschrift honoring the work of Timothy LS Sprigge, Sprigge summarizes his philosophy (a synthesis of absolute idealism, panpsychism, and utilitarianism), defends his position against criticism raised by philosophers in the preceding chapters of this volume, and offers in an addendum a proof for the existence of the Absolute, namely, a final and all-embracing Consciousness akin in many ways to Spinoza’s God. This defense of his philosophy consists mainly of responses to various points of criticism raised about his view of time, the relation between his metaphysics and ethics, panpsychism, the Absolute, and animal rights.

This organization adds to the concision and clarity of the book and works well with Heil's attempt to present ideas in an unpretentious manner. The dust jacket tells us that the book is written in an accessible, nontechnical style that is intended for non specialists as well as seasoned metaphysicians. But despite the organi zation and flow of bite-sized nuggets, I doubt anyone with less than graduate training in analytical philosophy will understand the problems and issues. A brief survey of the contemporary philosophers who get the most discussion should confirm the point.

Leemon McHenry|Sprigge’s Philosophical Idealism|Leemon McHenry|2003/10/1|Bradley Studies|9|2|109-125||For the past forty years, Timothy Sprigge has been a major player on the British philosophical scene contributing to discussions as diverse as consciousness, the ontology of time, personal identity, animal rights, punishment, censorship and wider issues in metaphysics, ethics and the history of philosophy. He is, however, less well known for his own highly original system of metaphysics and ethics-a synthesis of absolute idealism, panpsychism and utilitarianism. This system was constructed against the current of the dominant linguistic and analytical trends in Britain. While working within an intellectual milieu largely hostile to his views, he attempted to provide color to what seemed to him a rather sterile and narrow orthodoxy. In his magnum opus, The Vindication of Absolute Idealism, he says that his manner of doing philosophy attempts to arrive at answers to the" deep ontological questions about the concrete …

To Griffin, however, the" world-knot" has only tightened around the neck of materialism and substance dualism, both of which, he argues, present insuperable difficulties. He therefore boldly proposes a form of panpsychism-panexperimentalist physicialism-as the neglected solution that has eluded contemporary discussions. The long and patient labor of unsnarling the knot begins with Griffin's chapters devoted to common sense, regulative principles, data, and a detailed analysis of the difficulties of materialism and dualism. Although he discusses the problems unique to materialism and dualism respectively, Griffin's focus is on the problems that they share, because" the naturalistic materialism of late modernity simply …

Cases in point are divorce, contraception, and abortion (which in their effects, to say nothing of their nature, are disproportionately damaging to women). Nussbaum appeals to the words of John Paul II to support her views about freedom but she ignores his words about the evils of divorce, contraception, and abortion. In fact, in the case of contraception, she wants to stop the Pope and religious authorities generally from publicly speaking out against it. For contraception, she says, is a basic human right for women and any religious leader who speaks in public fora against it should be criticized as a" subverter of the constitution"(she does not say this about those who speak against abortion, but only, it seems, because some third world feminists speak against it). Nussbaum seems almost to be biting her tongue when she writes thus. From the general tone of her remarks one might rather …

Using contemporary set theory derived from Cantor, he contends that an actual infinite cannot be applied to the past because of counterintuitive absurdities and logical contradictions that result from such an attempt at instantiation in the real world. As he argues:“Because an actually infinite number of things cannot exist, the series of past events must be finite in number and, hence, the universe began to exist”@. 93). Craig’s argument also incorporates empirical evidence from physics, namely,(1) the expansion of the universe both from Hubble’s discovery of the red shift of light from distant galactic clusters and the microwave background radiation from the early phases of the universe, and (2) thermodynamics.

Leemon McHenry|Against Relativism: A Philosophical Defense of Method|Leemon B McHenry|1994/8/1|The Review of Metaphysics|47|3|619-621||Harris defines radical relativism as the view according to which “basic epistemological notions such as truth, evidence, reason, rationality, and perhaps most importantly, the method of inquiry are relative to a context, frame of reference, paradigm, or cognitive scheme”(p. xv). For radical relativists, the modernist is simply insensitive, closed-minded, and in tolerant of other cultures; hence the conception of some universal notion of rationality or human understanding is caricatured as the sexist, big oted, ethnocentricism of dead, white males. In the current overwhelm ing assent to relativism, however, the attempt to be more culturally sen sitive has the unfortunate consequence of depicting reason and scientific method as the tools of the oppressor, instead of the vital instruments of human progress. In the book’s penultimate chapter,“A Nineteenth-Century Reply to Post-Modernism,” Harris turns to Charles Peirce for the …

Leemon McHenry|The Disappearance of Time: Kurt Gödel and the Idealistic Tradition in Philosophy.|Leemon McHenry|1994/1/1||103|409|108-111|Oxford University Press, Mind Association|In the first half of this century, philosophers such as James, Whitehead and Bergson produced systems of metaphysics that" took time seriously". This meant that our experience of time as a dynamic, asymmetric process of becoming was taken to be a fundamental aspect of reality. With the influence of Einstein's theory of relativity, however, the ancient Eleatic conception of time re-emerged whereby the concept of space-time subordinated time to a geometrization of the temporal.

Leemon McHenry has explored these issues soberly and responsibly, and his conc1usions are most informative. 1 Yet I sometimes wonder whether the connection would be as firmly made had there not been one remark about Bradley in the preface to Process and Reality. 2 Whitehead's comments on Bradley need to be examined with considerable caution. After a1l, many find his judgments of other philosophers to be questionable. To cite just one examph : Whitehead sees his philosophy as broadly Platonic:" if we had to render Plato's general point of view with the least changes made necessary by the intervening two thousand years..., we should have to set about the construction of a philosophy of organism …

Throughout this work, Emmet is concerned to develop a general account of process. Her analysis, however, appears to be strongly influenced by social and biological paradigms in that individual things act as agents bringing about processes. As she says," Social processes illustrate my general view of processes as sustained and carried forward by the activities of their participants"(p. 87). This becomes particularly clear in chapter 5," Things in Processes and Things-in-Process," where she rejects an exclusive event ontology sustaining processes in favor of the view that both events and objects must function as particulars in any adequate conceptual scheme. In this respect, she sides with Davidson over Whitehead, Buddhists, and Parfit, because events or processes by themselves …

Leemon McHenry|Whitehead and Bradley: A Comparative Analysis|Michael Partridge, Leemon B McHenry|1992||||||In his magnum opus, Process and Reality, Alfred North Whitehead claims a special affinity to Oxford philosopher Francis Herbert Bradley. McHenry clarifies exactly how much of Whitehead's metaphysics is influenced by and accords with the main principles of Bradley's" absolute idealism." He argues that many of Whitehead's doctrines cannot be understood without an adequate understanding of Bradley, in terms of both affinities and contrasts. He evaluates the arguments between them and explores several important connections with William James, Josiah Royce, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell, and Charles Hartshorne 
Leemon McHenry|Pan-Physics: Whitehead's Philosophy of Natural Science|Leemon McHenry|1990||||||This chapter of Victor Lowe's Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and His Work, Volume II: 1910-1947 covers the development of Whitehead's philosophy of physics while he was Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Imperial College, London. Under the influence of Einstein's theory of relativity, Whitehead developed a theory of extension that explained the basis of the space-time manifold in terms of an ontology of events. Pan-physics was his term for the unification of the natural sciences as one general science. 
Leemon McHenry|A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes|Leemon B McHenry|1989/8/1|The Review of Metaphysics|42|3|626-628||With the discovery that light from distant galaxies is systematically shifted toward longer wavelengths (indicating galaxies receding from us with velocities proportional to their distances), an expanding uni verse has firmly replaced the static model of Einstein’s theory of gen eral relativity. The dynamic, expanding model now implies a begin ning of the universe that has to be a singularity of infinite density and space-time curvature. As with the big bang, singularities are also thought to exist in the gravitational collapse of a star that forms a black hole. In both cases of the big bang singularity and those of black holes, there is a breakdown of all the known laws of physics since they cannot accommodate infinite quantities. Hawking attempts to remedy this situation by using a quantum theory of gravity to discuss the very early stages of the universe. This unified theory includes two essential features:(i) Feynman’s for mulation …

Having a fair acquaintance with the massive event literature just within the analytic tradition, I found this work densely packed and often hard to follow, mainly because Bennett's own view is buried within the heap of examples and counterexamples. But this is not to say that one is not rewarded for the effort of following his painstaking criticism in his attempt to find a satisfactory view, one that is between the extremes of Kim and Quine, where the event concept is too large and too small respectively. Bennett defends a twofold thesis: first, that events are tropes, or concrete particulars understood as instances of properties that …

Leemon McHenry|Irrationality: An Essay on Akrasia, Self-Deception, and Self-Control|Leemon B McHenry|1988/8/1|The Review of Metaphysics|41|3|628-631||$24.95—The specific type of irrationality known as akrasia or weak ness of the will has been a subject of vigorous debate ever since Plato in his Protagoras had Socrates defend the thesis that “no one will ingly does wrong.” Against Socrates and many contemporary thinkers on the subject, Mele attempts to vindicate akrasia as a genu ine possibility. As he explores the theoretical labyrinth, his view emerges as rich in philosophic insight and experimental data from psychological research, the latter of which he uses effectively in showing the way out of a number of paradoxes. The possibility of “strict akratic action”(roughly, free intentional action against one’s better judgment) is his central concern. This seems to presuppose free will as a basis for the possibility of akrasia and Mele recognizes the importance of this point early on in the book. But in order to demarcate clearly his concerns and not venture too far into …

But the prevailing neglect of Whitehead, especially by his own countrymen, is indeed unfortunate. In this book Lewis Ford has thrown light on those obscure or con tradictory passages in Whitehead's writings by exposing a clear method of construction that he used in the composition of Science and the Modern Worldand Process and Reality. While previous commen tators have varied enormously in respective interpretations, just about all have agreed on the notion that Whitehead's metaphysical period, extending from Science and the Modern World to Modes of Thought, forms a consistent scheme of thought. Ford challenges this …

Lowe’s biography of Whitehead has been under way for over twenty years now. T he difficulty of the task is captured in one of Lowe’s opening remarks that “.,. no professional biographer in his right mind would touch him. I write out of the conviction that someone who knew him and his work ought to write as much about him as the unvoluminous extant materials allow; not a memoir, but an objective biography”(p. 2). Since Whitehead thought that the only subject of legitimate public interest in him was his published work, his manuscripts and letters were burned after his death. Thus the Nachlass essential to the biographer’s research is virtually nonexistent. But despite the missing material, Lowe has woven together Whiteheads life in a most lucid and straightforward manner. His authority gains in both his close association with Whitehead’s family …

Leemon McHenry|The Effectiveness of Causes|Leemon B McHenry|1985/12/1||39|2|351-353|Philosophy Education Society Inc.|352 JANICE FLOERSCH AND STAFF and the description of events in terms of different properties at dif ferent times. This analysis of a distinguishable sequence of events invariably leads to the notion of a" Zeno universe"(ch. 2). Like the paradox of the moving arrow where" motion is defined as the occu pation by one entity of a continuous series of places at a continuous series of times"(p. 10), movement and transitions are lost. Causation, as defined on this epistemological model, can never explain the genuine effectiveness of causes. At best we are left with a more or less Humean analysis of causation, as a relation between separate events. So as Emmet contends, the emphasis on properties of events only gives us a world of events, each of which is presented as an unchanging unit. But causation is not just the possibility of predicting changes in properties. Something more than this is needed in order that cau … 
Leemon McHenry|Experience and Relations in the Metaphysics of AN Whitehead and FH Bradley|Leemon Benton McHenry|1984||||||This thesis examines the affinities and contracts between AN Whitehead's process metaphysics and FH Bradley's Absolute Idealism. Whitehead drew upon Bradley's notion of experience in formulating his ontology, but disagreed sharply with Bradley on the status of relations. Whereas Bradley argued that relations and temporal transition are riddled with contradictions and cannot adequately characterize the nature of reality, Whitehead's interpretation of experience as happening in atomic or epochal units commits him to the reality of asymmetrical, temporal relations. Whitehead and Bradley share an opposition to the seventeenth-century cosmology which treated nature as a inert mechanism, but disagreed about the role of science in metaphysics. Bradley treated all science as dealing with appearances rather than reality. Whitehead formulated his metaphysics within the framework of modern physics, especially electromagnetism, relativity physics and quantum mechanics. This thesis ends with further comparisons between Bradley's Absolute and Whitehead's process theism. 
Leemon McHenry|Time, relations and dependence|Leemon McHenry|1983/6/1|The Southern Journal of Philosophy|21|3|405-419||IFH Bradley's theory oftime, though somewhat obscure, purports to establish the unreality of time by pointing to various contradictions inherent in our ordinary conceptions. Our thinking of time, for Bradley, remains among the lowest of appearances as we abstract from our immediacy and fracture reality into a plurality of moments. This, of course, involves relations of the moments of experience which lies at the heart of Bradley's attack on metaphysical pluralism. In this paper I provide a positive account of Bradley's theory of time and critically evaluate his arguments in light of a process view of time, namely that of AN Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. The main thrust of Bradley's argument occurs in three separate places in his writings-Chapter 11 of The Principles 0/Logic, Chapter XVIII" Temporal and Spatial Appearance" of Appearance and Realityand an earlier essay of 1887 published in Mind entitled" Why Do We … 
Leemon McHenry|American Values: Lessons I Learned from My Family by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.|Leemon McHenry|||||||The Kennedys embraced a political philosophy rooted in antiquity, one based on a domestic policy of justice and equality and a foreign policy of reason and gentle persuasion rather than force and fear. Imperialism abroad is inconsistent with democracy at home. This appears to be the foundation for John F. Kennedy’s foreign policy which also has a remarkable affinity to the lessons offered by Thucydides in the History of the Peloponnesian War and Plato in the Republic. Athens became the tragic hero after the aristocratic champion of democracy, Pericles, died and Athens lost its moral compass. 
Leemon McHenry|Whitehead’s Panpsychism and Deep Ecology|Leemon McHenry|||||||This essay examines AN Whitehead’s philosophy of organism as a basis for an ecological ethics. His views are compared with those of deep ecologists and several problems with his panpsychism are considered in connection with the notion of intrinsic value in nature. In spite of problems raised by critics, this essay concludes that Whitehead’s philosophy provides a world view that offers a corrective to the disastrous course set by views that regard nature as an inert mechanism.

The Statistical Update is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, healthcare policy makers, media professionals, the lay public, and many others who seek the best national data available on heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular disease–related morbidity and mortality and the risks, quality of care, medical procedures and operations, and costs associated with the management of these diseases in a single document. Indeed, since 1999, the Statistical Update has been cited> 10 500 times in the literature, based on citations of all annual versions. In 2011 alone, the various Statistical Updates were cited≈ 1500 times (data from ISI Web of Science). In recent years, the Statistical Update has undergone some major changes with the addition of new chapters and major updates across multiple areas, as well as increasing the number of ways to access and use the information assembled. For this year’s edition, the Statistics Committee, which produces the document for the AHA, updated all of the current chapters with the most recent nationally representative data and inclusion of relevant articles from the literature over the past year. This year’s edition also implements a new chapter organization to reflect the spectrum of cardiovascular health behaviors and health factors …

Objective: The objective of the study was to determine which aspects of dietary carbohydrate, specifically dietary sugar, fiber, glycemic index, or glycemic load, are associated with adiposity and insulin dynamics in overweight Latino children. Design: We examined 120 overweight Latino children (10–17 y old) with a family history of type 2 diabetes. Dietary intake was determined by repeated 24-h diet recalls. Adiposity was assessed by using total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin dynamics [insulin sensitivity (SI), acute insulin response, and disposition index (an index of β-cell function)] were measured by using a frequently sampled intravenous-glucose-tolerance test. Results: After adjustment for covariates, total sugar (g/d …

Study design Latino children (n = 253) were followed annually for up to 5 years. Longitudinal modeling was used to examine changes in SI, AIR, DI, and fasting and 2-hour glucose and insulin across Tanner stage. Results In boys, SI decreased in early puberty with a recovery by late puberty. The compensatory increase in AIR was appropriate in early maturation, but after Tanner stage 3, AIR declined by more than that predicted from the recovery in SI. For girls, SI decreased in early puberty and across all stages of maturation. In early maturation, there was an appropriate compensatory increase in AIR, but after Tanner stage 3, AIR decreased. Thus, DI deteriorated across puberty in boys and girls. Conclusions In overweight …

Design and Participants: The present study includes a cross-sectional analysis in 211 participants and a longitudinal analysis in a subset of 143 participants. Results: At baseline, cortisol was negatively associated with fasting glucose (r = 0.23; P < 0.01), β-cell function (disposition index, r = −0.24; P < 0.05), and acute insulin response to glucose (r = −0.27; P < 0.05). Baseline cortisol was also significantly related to the change in insulin sensitivity over 1 yr (r = −0.23; P < 0.05). These results did not differ by Tanner stage or sex. Conclusions: Cortisol contributes to the reduction in insulin sensitivity at an early age in Latino children …

The underlying physiological mechanisms have yet to be established. We hypothesized that air pollution adversely affects insulin sensitivity and secretion and serum lipid levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were selected from BetaGene (n = 1,023), a study of insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell function in Mexican Americans. All participants underwent DXA and oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests and completed dietary and physical activity questionnaires. Ambient air pollutant concentrations (NO2, O3, and PM2.5) for short- and long-term periods were assigned by spatial interpolation (maximum interpolation radius of 50 km) of data from air quality monitors. Traffic-related air pollution from freeways (TRAP) was estimated using the dispersion model as NOx. Variance …

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a longitudinal research design, insulin sensitivity (Si) of 96 research participants was determined at baseline and 1 year later. Body adiposity was assessed at four assessments. RESULTS The change in Si during the first year of the study was a significant predictor of further fat mass development (P < 0.05). Considering different directions of Si change, Si was a strong predictor for further fat mass development only in the group that decreased their Si (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The results show that the direction of change in insulin sensitivity at an early age is an important independent predictor for further fat mass development and emphasize the importance of insulin sensitivity …

However, no information is available regarding the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio during adolescence in Hispanic adolescents. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio during growth and to establish whether the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio is a better predictor for insulin sensitivity compared to leptin and adiponectin alone in a regression model. From the age of 8 to 14, the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio increased from 2.0±0.8 to 5.8±2.2 in girls, with no significant change noted in boys (gender × …

Claudia Toledo-Corral|Metabolic basis of ethnic differences in diabetes risk in overweight and obese youth|Tanya L Alderete, Claudia M Toledo-Corral, Michael I Goran|2014/2/1|Current diabetes reports|14|2|455|Springer US|The global pandemic of childhood obesity has led to increased risk for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown decreased insulin sensitivity and/or secretion with increasing adiposity and consistently observed greater risk for T2DM in obese, non-Caucasian youth. In the current review we describe recent advances in understanding how obesity and metabolic status in children and adolescents confers various risk profiles for T2DM among Latinos, African Americans, Caucasians, Asians, and Native Americans. These possible determinants include ectopic fat distribution, adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and elevated plasma levels of nonesterified free fatty acids. Future work should aim to elucidate the ethnic-specific pathophysiology of T2DM in order to develop and implement appropriate prevention and treatment strategies based on different ethnic profiles of diabetes …

IGFBP-1 was inversely correlated to total fat mass (r=-0.55, ρ< 0.001) in simple correlations; however, this relationship was eliminated after controlling for covariates (r= 0.02, ρ= 0.85). Correlations with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue yielded similar results. These results demonstrate that IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 are all inversely related to adiposity in …

Members of the neuropoietic cytokine family, which include IL-6, LIF, and CNTF among others, have been shown to be important regulators of peripheral nerves and the muscles that they innervate. To investigate their potential role in diabetic nerve and muscle, we studied the expression of the shared receptor subunits, LIFR and gp130 in a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The results of Western blotting and densitometric analysis showed that both LIFR and gp130 protein expression were increased in diabetic sciatic nerve compared to control mice at early time points following STZ injection. In diabetic gastrocnemius muscle, LIFR and gp130 were increased from 3 days to 24 weeks following STZ injection. In contrast, both LIFR and gp130 protein expression were decreased in diabetic …

We found that proximity to freeways was associated with reduced BMD. Our findings suggest that traffic-related pollution may contribute to the occurrence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Introduction Adults residing in rural areas have been linked with higher BMD. We aimed to determine if this difference is due in part to air pollution by examining the relationships between traffic metrics and ambient air pollution with total body and pelvic BMD. Methods Mexican American adults (n = 1,175; mean 34 years; 72 % female) who had participated in the BetaGene study of air pollution, obesity, and insulin resistance were included in this analysis. Total body and pelvic BMD were estimated using dual …

While exact mechanisms for this association are unknown, circulating adipokines are hypothesized to contribute to early‐life weight gain. Methods The Maternal and Child Health Study birth cohort included 136 women from the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center. This study estimated prenatal residential TRAP exposure and used linear regression analysis to examine associations between adipokines with TRAP exposure and infant weight change (birth to 6 months). Results A one standard deviation (1‐SD: 2 ppb) increase in prenatal non‐freeway nitrogen oxides was associated with 33% (P = 0.01) higher leptin and 9% higher high molecular weight adiponectin levels (P = 0.07) in cord blood.

Claudia Toledo-Corral|Childhood obesity: causes, consequences, and intervention approaches|Michael I Goran|2016/10/14|||||CRC Press|Obesity is the most prevalent chronic health condition in children, thereby it is a major public health concern. Between the 1960s and 2012, there was an almost fourfold increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among both children and adolescents in the United States. 1, 2 According to the 2011–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately 34% of children and 35% of adolescents are overweight or obese. 2 Trends in preschool-age children have been slightly different. Although there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of obesity, from less than 4% of preschool-age children in NHANES I (1971–1974) to more than 7% in 2011–2012, rates are now decreasing among preschool-age children, but continue to increase among adolescents. 3 Between 2003–2004 and 2011–2012, the prevalence of obesity among two-to five-year-old children decreased …

There has also been a slow but steady rise in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in youth. The current review summarizes recent findings regarding the impact of increased exposure to air pollutants on the type 2 diabetes epidemic. Recent Findings Human and animal studies provide strong evidence that exposures to ambient and traffic-related air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important role in metabolic dysfunction and type 2 diabetes etiology. This work is supported by recent findings that have observed similar effect sizes for increased exposure to air pollutants on clinical measures of risk for type 2 diabetes in children and adults. Further, studies indicate that these effects … 
Claudia Toledo-Corral|Dyslipidemia: Relationship to insulin resistance, fatty liver, and sub-clinical atherosclerosis|Claudia M Toledo-Corral, Tanya L Alderete, Michael I Goran|2015||||65-79|Springer, Cham|Insulin resistance and dyslipidemias are clinical hallmarks of cardiometabolic and fatty liver disease, however the underlying pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Therefore, there is considerable interest in adequately defining risk factors by age, sex, and race/ethnicity in an effort to design appropriate interventions and treatments for obesity-related diseases. This chapter begins with a background on the epidemiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and subclinical atherosclerosis. By focusing on the distribution of body, where we will also emphasize hypothesized mechanisms behind insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and its relationship to atherosclerosis progression. Finally, we will discuss advanced imaging methods and treatments used to identify and treat these obesity-related metabolic disorders.

A growing body of evidence implicates environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution, metals) and social stressors (e.g., poverty, violence) in contributing to obesity-related biobehavioral processes, such as physical activity, dietary intake, perceived stress, and cortisol regulation. However, current understanding of the role of environmental exposures and social stressors on obesity-related biobehavioral processes is limited by infrequent, inter-individual measurement, and lack of personal exposure monitoring. The “Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors” (MADRES) real-time and personal sampling study examines the within-subject day-level effects of environmental and social stressors on maternal pre- and post-partum obesity-related biobehavioral responses. Among a cohort of 65 low-income, Hispanic women in urban Los Angeles, this study uses innovative personal, real-time data capture strategies (e.g., ecological momentary assessment [EMA], personal exposure monitoring, geolocation monitoring, accelerometry) to repeatedly assess obesity-related processes during the 1st and 3rd trimester, and at 4–6 months postpartum. Day-level effects of environmental exposures and social stressors on women’s physical activity, diet, perceived stress and salivary cortisol measured across repeated days will be tested using …

Claudia Toledo-Corral|2 Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Childhood Obesity|Claudia M Toledo-Corral|2016/10/14|Childhood Obesity: Causes, Consequences, and Intervention Approaches||||CRC Press|Diversification of race and ethnicity in the United States continues to evolve and it is now projected that by 2050 non-Latino Caucasians will no longer be the majority [1]. These estimates show that the fastest migration rates will arise from Latino and Asian countries but Latinos will compose the largest racial and ethnic group [1]. Due to this racial and ethnic population shift, any existing health disparities are of increasing concern in public health and medicine. As a prime example, the rates of obesity in US children, adolescents, and adults are more pronounced in racial and ethnic groups such as Blacks and Latinos [2, 3]. The risk of obesity and metabolic disease is also increasing in the Asian population, which has gone unnoticed due to the misclassification of obesity using the current body mass index (BMI) cutoffs [4]. The projected population increase in each of these racial and ethnic groups, coupled with current pediatric obesity rates in the

Design: Subjects were 205 overweight, Latino youth (age 8–13 yr, body mass index percentile 85, family history positive for type 2 diabetes). Measures included body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) by magnetic resonance imaging, insulin sensitivity by frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test/minimal model, fasting lipids, and serum cortisol. Results: Children with MS had higher body mass index percentile, total body fat mass, and IAAT and lower insulin sensitivity than those without MS. Children with MS had higher morning serum cortisol levels, whether unadjusted (10.1 3.7 vs. 9.0 2.8 g/dl, P 0.05) or after adjusting for age, gender, total body fat and lean tissue mass, and insulin sensitivity (10.40. 4vs. 8.90. 3g/dl, P 0.01). Increasing number of features of MS was associated with higher cortisol levels, after adjusting for covariates (P 0.001). Among individual features of MS, systolic blood pressure had the strongest relationship with adjusted cortisol level (r 0.34; P 0.001), followed by diastolic blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose (both r 0.23; P 0.01). IAAT was associated with cortisol (r 0.16; P 0.05), whereas high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and waist circumference were not. Conclusions: In overweight, Latino youth, MS is associated with higher morning serum cortisol levels, independent of body fat and insulin sensitivity. More studies are needed to investigate the role of relative hypercortisolism and … 
Myriam Forster|A framework for the specificity of addictions|Steve Sussman, Adam Leventhal, Ricky N Bluthenthal, Marilyn Freimuth, Myriam Forster, Susan L Ames|2011/8|International journal of environmental research and public health|8|8|3399-3415|Molecular Diversity Preservation International|Research over the last two decades suggests that a wide range of substance and behavioral addictions may serve similar functions. Yet, co-occurrence of addictions has only been reported among a minority of addicts.“Addiction specificity” pertains to a phenomenon in which one pattern of addictive behaviors may be acquired whereas another is not. This paper presents the PACE model as a framework which might help explain addiction specificity. Pragmatics, attraction, communication, and expectation (PACE) variables are described, which may help give some direction to future research needs in this arena. View Full-Text 
Myriam Forster|Predictors of alcohol-related negative consequences in adolescents: A systematic review of the literature and implications for future research|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Jennifer B Unger, Steve Sussman|2016/4/1||48||18-35|Academic Press|Objective To conduct a systematic review of the literature examining risk and protective factors of alcohol related negative consequences (ARNCs) among adolescents. Methods We conducted a systematic search of original empirical articles published between January 1, 1990 and June 1, 2015. The qualitative synthesis was performed using the Theory of Triadic Influence as a framework. Results Fifty-two studies were reviewed. Intrapersonal (e.g., personality traits, drinking motives and expectancies, depression), interpersonal (e.g., parental and peer alcohol use, violence exposure) and attitudinal factors (e.g., media exposure to alcohol, religiosity) influence ARNCs. Emerging evidence of new trends contributing to ARNCs include ready mixed alcohol drinks and childhood trauma and abuse. Conclusions Risk factors from all domains of influence were observed. More research is needed on protective factors and how … 
Myriam Forster|Bullying victimization as a mediator of associations between cultural/familial variables, substance use, and depressive symptoms among Hispanic youth|Myriam Forster, Stephanie R Dyal, Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Chih-Ping Chou, Daniel W Soto, Jennifer B Unger|2013/8/1|Ethnicity & health|18|4|415-432|Taylor & Francis Group|Objectives. This article examines the antecedents and consequences of bullying victimization among a sample of Hispanic high school students. Although cultural and familial variables have been examined as potential risk or protective factors for substance use and depression, previous studies have not examined the role of peer victimization in these processes. We evaluated a conceptual model in which cultural and familial factors influenced the risk of victimization, which in turn influenced the risk of substance use and depression. Design. Data were collected as part of a longitudinal survey study of 9th and 10th grade Hispanic/Latino students in Southern California (n = 1167). The student bodies were at least 70% Hispanic/Latino with a range of socioeconomic characteristics represented. We used linear and logistic regression models to test hypothesized relationships between cultural … 
Myriam Forster|The role of bicultural stress and perceived context of reception in the expression of aggression and rule breaking behaviors among recent-immigrant Hispanic youth|Myriam Forster, Timothy Grigsby, Daniel W Soto, Seth J Schwartz, Jennifer B Unger|2015/7|Journal of interpersonal violence|30|11|1807-1827|Sage Publications|Adolescent aggression and delinquency impede healthy adjustment in early adulthood and may have particularly serious long-term consequences for minority youth. Therefore, prevention research should examine these behaviors within a sociocultural framework among newer immigrant samples to determine whether, and how, adaptation to life in the US affects these behaviors. This study investigated the role of two sociocultural variables–bicultural stress and negative context of reception–on changes in aggression and rule breaking behaviors over two time points among recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents residing in Los Angeles (N = 136) and Miami-Dade (N = 142) counties. Linear stepwise regression models were used to assess the associations between predictors and behavioral outcomes. Bicultural stress and negative context of reception both had independent associations, above and beyond … 
Myriam Forster|Characteristics of emerging adulthood and e-cigarette use: findings from a pilot study|Jon-Patrick Allem, Myriam Forster, Adam Neiberger, Jennifer B Unger|2015/11/1|Addictive behaviors|50||40-44|Pergamon|Introduction Emerging adults (ages 18 to 25) are more likely to use e-cigarettes compared to other age groups, but little is known about their risk and protective factors. A next step to understanding e-cigarette use among emerging adults may involve examining how transition-to-adulthood themes are associated with e-cigarette use. It may also be important to know which specific transitions, and how the accumulated number of role transitions experienced in emerging adulthood, are associated with e-cigarette use. Methods Emerging adults completed surveys indicating their identification with transition-to-adulthood themes, role transitions in the past year, and e-cigarette use. Logistic regression models examined the associations between transition-to-adulthood themes and e-cigarette use. Separate logistic regression models explored the association between individual role transitions, as well as the accumulated … 
Myriam Forster|The protective role of school friendship ties for substance use and aggressive behaviors among middle school students|Myriam Forster, Timothy J Grigsby, Alden Bunyan, Jennifer Beth Unger, Thomas William Valente|2015/2|Journal of school health|85|2|82-89|Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|BACKGROUND Few studies have examined the interplay among quantifiable aspects of peer bonds, friendship types, personal characteristics, and behavioral outcomes in schools in distressed neighborhoods. The aim of this study was to identify compensatory and protective factors that can be promoted in school‐based prevention programs. METHODS The sample was comprised of students in East Los Angeles County (N = 184). We investigated the association between 3 measures of social influence (friends in gangs, nominations of schoolmates as friends [out‐degree], and the number of nominations received from schoolmates [in‐degree]) and social self‐control with lifetime alcohol, tobacco, inhalant, “other” drug use, and aggression. RESULTS Friendships were protective for substance use and aggression and moderated the relationship between social self‐control, substance use, and aggression. We … 
Myriam Forster|Associations between adverse childhood experiences, student-teacher relationships, and non-medical use of prescription medications among adolescents|Myriam Forster, Amy L Gower, Iris W Borowsky, Barbara J McMorris|2017/5/1|Addictive behaviors|68||30-34|Pergamon|Objective Few studies have investigated associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and nonmedical use of prescription medication (NMUPM) in population-based samples of adolescents, and even fewer have examined whether promotive factors might buffer these effects. The present study assesses the direct effects of ACE and positive student-teacher relationships on NUMPD and whether positive student-teacher relationships moderate this association. Design Data were from the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (MSS), an in-school survey administered every three years to students throughout Minnesota. The analytic sample (n = 104,332) was comprised of 8th, 9th, and 11th graders. Results Approximately 3% of students acknowledged past year NMUPM, the majority of whom reported at least one ACE. The most frequently used prescription drug was Ritalin/ADHD medications (1.71%) followed … 
Myriam Forster|Associations between gun violence exposure, gang associations, and youth aggression: Implications for prevention and intervention programs|Myriam Forster, Timothy J Grigsby, Jennifer B Unger, Steve Sussman|2015|Journal of criminology|2015|||Hindawi|Using cross-sectional data collected from three middle schools in Southeast Los Angeles, we assessed the association of neighborhood violence exposure, gang associations, and social self-control with past week aggression in a sample of minority youth (). Results from Poisson and logistic regression models showed that direct exposure to gun violence, having friends in gangs, and low social self control were all positively associated with past week aggression. Among girls, having gang affiliated family members was positively associated with aggression, whereas among boys having friends in gangs was associated with past week aggression. Subjective expectations of engagement in future interpersonal violence were associated with being male, having friends in gangs, and fear of neighborhood gun violence. We recommend that youth violence prevention and intervention programs address the impact of family, peers, and gun violence on student coping and identify students with low social self-control who could benefit from social and emotional skills training. 
Myriam Forster|The relationship between family-based adverse childhood experiences and substance use behaviors among a diverse sample of college students|Myriam Forster, Timothy J Grigsby, Christopher J Rogers, Stephanie M Benjamin|2018/1/1|Addictive behaviors|76||298-304|Pergamon|Introduction Research suggests that college students are an especially vulnerable subset of the population for substance use and misuse. However, despite evidence of the high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among students and the link between family-based ACE and substance use among older adults, this relationship remains understudied in college populations. Moreover, whether ACE represents a shared risk across substance use behaviors and ethnic groups is unknown. Methods Data are student responses (n = 2953) on the 2015 American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment II (ACHA-NCHA II) administered at one of the largest, most diverse public universities in California. Multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression models tested the association between individual and accumulated ACE and past 30-day alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and illicit … 
Myriam Forster|Problematic substance use among hispanic adolescents and young adults: implications for prevention efforts|Timothy J Halley Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Daniel Wood Soto, Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Jennifer Beth Unger|2014/7/3|Substance use & misuse|49|8|1025-1038|Taylor & Francis|Using data collected between 2005 and 2012 from a longitudinal study of acculturation patterns and substance use among Hispanic youth in Southern California (N = 2722), we fit multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association of type and frequency of drug use, friend and parent drug use, cultural orientation (measured by the ARSMA-II), and psychological distress (CES-D score) in 10th grade with problematic substance use (measured with the RAPI) in (i) 11th grade and (ii) young adulthood. We conclude that future intervention efforts with Hispanic adolescents and young adults should target polysubstance and problem users and emphasize inter-individual, structural, and cultural processes as they relate to problematic substance use. 
Myriam Forster|Evaluation of a telenovela designed to improve knowledge and behavioral intentions among Hispanic patients with end-stage renal disease in Southern California|Myriam Forster, Jon-Patrick Allem, Nicole Mendez, Yasir Qazi, Jennifer B Unger|2016/1/2|Ethnicity & health|21|1|58-70|Routledge|Objectives. Culturally relevant education is needed to improve rates of successful kidney transplantation among Hispanic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This study examined whether patients’ knowledge about kidney disease, postoperative care, and proactive health practices improved after watching a telenovela series about ESRD. Design. 334 ESRD patients and 94 family members/caregivers were assigned to watch a telenovela (‘Fixing Paco,’ a bilingual health education film) or receive standard of care at a transplant center or at a dialysis clinic. Outcomes for pre-transplant patients assigned to standard of care at dialysis centers or at a transplant center were compared to pre-transplant patients in the treatment condition (standard of care + telenovela). Results. Knowledge and behavioral intention scores at baseline across conditions and locations were similar, suggesting that assignment … 
Myriam Forster|Perceived discrimination, cultural identity development, and intimate partner violence among a sample of Hispanic young adults.|Myriam Forster, Timothy J Grigsby, Daniel W Soto, Steve Y Sussman, Jennifer B Unger|2017/10|Cultural diversity and ethnic minority psychology|23|4|576|Educational Publishing Foundation|Objective: Despite the prevalence of interpersonal violence (IPV), scientific understanding of the risk and protective factors for unidirectional and bidirectional IPV, and especially the role of sociocultural variables in these behaviors, is limited. This study investigates the association between ethnic-identity search, ethnic-identity affirmation, perceived discrimination, and unidirectional (victimization only, perpetration only) and bidirectional (reciprocal violence) IPV behaviors among foreign-born and US-born Hispanic young adults. Method: Data are from Project RED (Reteniendo y Entendiendo Diversidad para Salud), a study investigating the effect of psychosocial and sociocultural factors on health behavior among a community sample of Hispanic young adults in Southern California (n= 1,267). Results: Approximately 40% of the sample reported unidirectional or bidirectional IPV, with significant gender differences … 
Myriam Forster|Do adolescent drug use consequences predict externalizing and internalizing problems in emerging adulthood as well as traditional drug use measures in a Hispanic sample?|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Daniel W Soto, Jennifer B Unger|2014/3/1|Addictive behaviors|39|3|644-651|Pergamon|The present study compares statistical models for three conceptualizations of drug use in 11th grade (past 30 day ever/never use, past 30 day frequency of drug use and past 30 day drug use consequences) with externalizing and internalizing problems in emerging adulthood when controlling for age, academic achievement and socioeconomic status in a Hispanic sample. Multivariate logistic regression models for the different drug use variables were compared when modeling weapon carrying, arrest, multiple lifetime sex partners, drug/alcohol use before sex and condom use in emerging adulthood. A multivariate linear regression model was used to model depression in emerging adulthood as a function of drug use measurement controlling for other covariates and depression in adolescence. Our findings suggest that any conceptualization of drug use will produce equitable results and model fit statistics when … 
Myriam Forster|Adverse childhood experiences and school-based victimization and perpetration|Myriam Forster, Amy L Gower, Barbara J McMorris, Iris W Borowsky|2017/1/1|Journal of interpersonal violence|||0886260517689885|Sage Publications|Retrospective studies using adult self-report data have demonstrated that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase risk of violence perpetration and victimization. However, research examining the associations between adolescent reports of ACE and school violence involvement is sparse. The present study examines the relationship between adolescent reported ACE and multiple types of on-campus violence (bringing a weapon to campus, being threatened with a weapon, bullying, fighting, vandalism) for boys and girls as well as the risk of membership in victim, perpetrator, and victim–perpetrator groups. The analytic sample was comprised of ninth graders who participated in the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (n ~ 37,000). Multinomial logistic regression models calculated the risk of membership for victim only, perpetrator only, and victim–perpetrator subgroups, relative to no violence involvement, for … 
Myriam Forster|School practices to foster LGBT-supportive climate: Associations with adolescent bullying involvement|Amy L Gower, Myriam Forster, Kari Gloppen, Abigail Z Johnson, Marla E Eisenberg, John E Connett, Iris W Borowsky|2018/8/1|Prevention Science|19|6|813-821|Springer US|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth experience disproportionate rates of bullying compared to their heterosexual peers. Schools are well-positioned to address these disparities by creating supportive school climates for LGBT youth, but more research is needed to examine the variety of practices and professional development opportunities put in place to this end. The current study examines how school practices to create supportive LGBT student climate relate to student reports of bullying. Student-level data come from the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey, a state-wide survey of risk and protective factors. Ninth and eleventh grade students (N = 31,183) reported on frequency of physical and relational bullying victimization and perpetration and sexual orientation-based harassment. School administrators reported on six practices related to creating supportive LGBT school climate (N = 103 … 
Myriam Forster|Changes in the strength of peer influence and cultural factors on substance use initiation between late adolescence and emerging adulthood in a Hispanic sample|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Daniel W Soto, Jennifer B Unger|2017/4/3|Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse|16|2|137-154|Taylor & Francis|We examine whether peer substance use and cultural factors differentially influence the initiation of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use in adolescence and emerging adulthood (EA) among a community-based sample of Hispanics. Participants provided data in 11th grade (M = 16.8 years old, SD = 0.54) and emerging adulthood (M = 20.3 years old, SD = 0.6). Peer tobacco use had a stronger association with initiation of tobacco use in emerging adulthood (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.89) than in adolescence (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.40), but this pattern was not observed with initiation of alcohol or marijuana use. Cultural orientation is associated with initiation of tobacco use during EA but not with initiation of alcohol or marijuana use. 
Myriam Forster|A perspective on cigarette smoking during alcohol and substance use treatment|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Steve Sussman|2015/7/29|Substance use & misuse|50|8-9|1199-1204|Informa Healthcare|Individuals in treatment for substance use continue to smoke at higher rates than the general population of the United States. This editorial presents a different perspective on cigarette smoking that might reflect aspects of the subculture of individuals who, representing a heterogeneous population, smoke while recovering from substance use associated problems. We discuss factors that independently and, in combination, influence cigarette smoking during treatment and recovery from substance use. We conclude that more qualitative research is needed to understand which factors, not typically emphasized in standard tobacco cessation programming, may contribute to cigarette smoking cessation for this population. 
Myriam Forster|Adverse childhood experiences and early initiation of marijuana and alcohol use: the potential moderating effects of internal assets|Debanjana Chatterjee, Barbara McMorris, Amy L Gower, Myriam Forster, Iris Wagman Borowsky, Marla E Eisenberg|2018/8/24|Substance use & misuse|53|10|1624-1632|Taylor & Francis|Introduction: Early adolescence is a critical risk period for initiation of substance use. Internal assets (IAs), which are individual qualities guiding positive choices, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are important protective and risk factors, respectively, against substance use. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether IAs modify associations between ACEs and early initiation of alcohol and marijuana use. Method: Data were from 9th and 11th graders who completed the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (n = 79,339). Students reported on experiences of abuse, household dysfunction, and substance use. Multivariable logistic regressions examined associations between different types of ACEs and substance use. Interactions between IAs and ACEs were added to models to test effect modification. For significant interactions, main effects models were re-estimated at different percentiles of IAs. Result … 
Myriam Forster|Household Incarceration and Salient Emerging Adult Role Transitions: Findings From an Urban Sample of Hispanic Youth|M Forster, L Davis, R Shlafer, JB Unger|2018/3/20|Emerging Adulthood||||Sage|In California, Hispanic children are 2.5 times as likely to have a family member in prison than their non-Hispanic White peers. Despite these ethnic disparities, few studies have examined the longitudinal impact of household incarceration on age-salient developmental transitions among Hispanic emerging adults. Using a matching method to control for demographic and psychosocial factors, we investigated whether emerging adults who were raised in families with an incarcerated adult experienced labor force participation, family formation, education, and criminal justice involvement differently than their peers without a history of family incarceration. Participants who had a history of household incarceration and who interacted with the criminal justice system themselves had significantly different transition experiences than their peers (higher odds of past year job loss, cohabitation, and having a child by age 20, and … 
Myriam Forster|“First Things First”: What is the First Thing?|Steve Sussman, Myriam Forster, Timothy Grigsby|2015/7/29|Substance use & misuse|50|8-9|1015-1019|Informa Healthcare|This op-ed piece comments on the down-side of an otherwise useful 12-step slogan, “First Things First,” which generally refers to staying sober (not drinking or using no matter what). While important, there are environmental, microsocial, psychiatric, and neurobiological considerations that may place other needs at an equal or higher priority than sobriety per se. That is, other changes may be needed to set the stage for, or enhance efforts at sobriety, prior to or concurrent with attempting to quit one's drug of choice. Perhaps slogans should be considered in a broader context and not be taken too literally. 
Myriam Forster|Substance use outcomes for Hispanic emerging adults exposed to incarceration of a household member during childhood|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Laurel Davis, Jennifer B Unger|2018/9/27|Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse|||1-13|Taylor & Francis|This study investigates whether Hispanic emerging adults exposed to household incarceration before age 18 report higher rates of past 30-day cigarette, alcohol, binge drinking, marijuana use, and negative substance use consequences, relative to participants not exposed to incarceration of a household member. Respondents were matched on key characteristics to create balanced groups of exposed and nonexposed respondents. Negative binomial regression models assessed primary research questions. There were significant long-term associations between household incarceration and the frequency of past 30-day binge drinking, marijuana use, and number of negative substance use consequences. Policies and health programs addressing household incarceration may be a promising prevention approach to reduce negative substance use outcomes among Hispanic emerging adults. 
Myriam Forster|Cultural stressors, identity development, and substance use attitudes among Hispanic immigrant adolescents|Timothy J Grigsby, Myriam Forster, Alan Meca, Byron L Zamboanga, Seth J Schwartz, Jennifer B Unger|2018/1|Journal of Community Psychology|46|1|117-132||The goal of this investigation was to determine whether various cultural stressors (bicultural stress, perceived discrimination, and perceived negative context of reception [PNCR]) predict positive and negative substance use attitudes, directly and indirectly through personal identity, in a sample of immigrant Hispanic adolescents. Data on cultural stressors, substance use attitudes, and covariates were collected from 302 Hispanic immigrant adolescents (152 from Miami [61% Cuban] and 150 from Los Angeles [70% Mexican]) at 3 time points. PNCR was associated with identity confusion (β = .175, p = .033). Identity confusion significantly predicted higher positive attitudes toward alcohol and other drug (AOD; β = .216, p < .001) and cigarette use (β = .191, p = .015) and mediated the relationship between PNCR with unfavorable AOD attitudes (β = −.019, 95% confidence interval [CI] [− 0.052, − 0.001]) and favorable … 
Myriam Forster|Associations between multiple dimensions of school engagement, peer relationships, and risky health behaviors among vulnerable middle school students|Myriam Forster, Kari M Gloppen, Amy L Gower, Jennifer A Oliphant, Renee E Sieving, Barbara J McMorris|2017/2/1|Journal of Adolescent Health|60|2|S31-S32|Elsevier|Purpose Middle school is a critical developmental period characterized by increased susceptibility to internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Adolescents’ sense of belonging at school, perceptions that teachers are supportive and caring, engagement in academic work, and bonds with prosocial friends are all potential promotive mechanisms for healthy youth development. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether three dimensions of school engagement (emotional, behavioral, cognitive) and peer relationships were differentially associated with middle school students’ reports of internalizing symptoms, delinquency, and bullying involvement to identify needs and assets that can be emphasized in prevention programming. Methods Data are from a 2015 baseline survey of 601 6th graders participating in a comparative effectiveness study of three middle schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area …

Myriam Forster|132. Perceived Context of Reception And Mental Health Among Hispanic And Somali Youth|Myriam Forster, Eunice Areba, Barbara Peterson, Jessica Baker, Jonathan Watts|2019/2/1|Journal of Adolescent Health|64|2|S68-S69|Elsevier|Purpose Host community’s receptivity to immigrant and refugee populations can play a significant role in the adaptation to life in United States, a transition that can challenge the mental and behavioral health of adolescents. Context of reception is a measure that captures newcomer’s perceptions of the level of openness or hostility of a receiving community and the social and economic opportunities available to them. Prior work has demonstrated that negative contexts of reception are associated with depression in Hispanic adolescents. However, the association between negative and positive context of reception and mental health among diverse immigrant and refugee adolescent populations has not been well researched. This study investigates the relationship between perceived positive and negative context of reception and symptoms of anxiety and depression among Hispanic and Somali immigrant and …

The present study explored the relationship between negative substance use consequences (eg, having trouble at school or work) and noncondom use in this at‐risk population and whether these associations varied by sex. METHODS Participants (N = 1101; 62.9% Hispanic; Mage = 16.85) were sampled from 24 alternative high schools in California, and data were analyzed using cross‐sectional multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS We observed a relationship between the number of negative substance use consequences and probability of noncondom use at the last sexual encounter for boys (p < .001) but not girls (p > .05). There were significant associations between specific social consequences (missing school/work) and … 
Myriam Forster|Ethnic variations in the relationship between multiple stress domains and use of several types of tobacco/nicotine products among a diverse sample of adults|Christopher J Rogers, Myriam Forster, Jennifer B Unger|2018/6/1|Addictive behaviors reports|7||96-102|Elsevier|Introduction Financial strain and discrimination are consistent predictors of negative health outcomes and maladaptive coping behaviors, including tobacco use. Although there is considerable information exploring stress and smoking, limited research has examined the relationship between patterns of stress domains and specific tobacco/nicotine product use. Even fewer studies have assessed ethnic variations in these relationships. Methods This study investigated the relationship between discrimination and financial strain and current tobacco/nicotine product use and explored the ethnic variation in these relationships among diverse sample of US adults (N = 1068). Separate logistic regression models assessed associations between stress domains and tobacco/nicotine product use, adjusting for covariates (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, and household income). Due to statistically significant differences, the …

Myriam Forster|A Sociocultural and Developmental Approach to Intimate Partner Violence Among a Sample of Hispanic Emerging Adults|Myriam Forster|2016||||||Intimate partner violence research has yet to investigate the interplay between developmental risks, sociocultural stressors, and culture-specific factors in unidirectional and bidirectional IPV among minority populations. The current scholarly challenge is to translate the importance of culture into research approaches that clarify and highlight the impact of the sociocultural experience on behavioral outcomes, and how health researchers can translate meaningful conceptualizations and measures of culture to prevention and intervention services. These studies were designed to assess whether culture-specific factors and experiences influence these behaviors among a community sample of Hispanic emerging adults. Specifically, these studies contribute to scientific knowledge by exploring the associations between developmental risks (exposure to inter-parental violence, childhood sexual, physical or verbal abuse …

All three populations were healthy and reproductive. Most of the chemical elements examined in sampled foliage occurred at concentrations similar to those previously reported for the genus. However, one notable geographic trend was revealed: concentrations of S tended to be highest in mainland plants closest to the urbanized east coast. Continued use of these bromeliads and other Florida vascular epiphytes for air quality surveillance is recommended. 
David Bermudes|Symbiosis inferred from the fossil record|David Bermudes, Richard C Back|1991|Margulis and Fester|||72-91||Fossil assemblages are notorious for their many biases. Notably, hard parts are more likely to be preserved than soft ones. The fossil record is largely a history of these hard parts from which past biology must be inferred. There is little direct evidence of symbiosis in the fossil record. Most microbial symbionts do not preserve well, and thus a host and a symbiont are seldom preserved together. Notable exceptions are the fungus-root associations found in Rhynie cherts dating to 400 million years ago (Kidston and Lang 1921; Boullard and Lemoigne 1971). These associations are sometimes interpreted as mutualistic mycorrhizae (Pirozynski and Malloch 1975; Malloch et al. 1980; Pirozynski and Dalpe 1989), although problems remain with interpretations of biological relationships based purely on morphology. Co-preservation insufficiently resolves the question of the influence of a biological relationship, and thus additional information must be sought. Actualistic assumptions have been applied to ecology (Mayr 1963) and genetics (Dobzhansky 1951) for the interpretation of the fossil record and, we believe, should be further extended to incorporate symbiosis. The field of symbiosis has long been a contributor to the understanding of biology (De Bary 1879; Mereschkovskii 1910; Wallin 1927), yet symbiosis remains largely peripheral to contemporary evolutionary theory. Several papers have already discussed the influence of symbiosis on evolutionary history (Taylor 1979, 1983; Cowen 1983; Margulis and Bermudes 1985; Bermudes and Margulis 1987). The purpose of this paper is to identify different ways in which symbiosis may have influenced …

Genetically modified Salmonella typhimurium, which is capable of multiplying selectively in tumours and inhibiting their growth, represents a new approach for cancer treatment. Because of its selectivity for tumour tissues, S. typhimurium would also be an ideal vector for delivering therapeutic proteins to tumours. VNP20009, an attenuated strain of S. typhimurium with deletions in msbB and purI genes, possesses desirable attributes, such as low toxicity, tumour-selective multiplication and an intrinsic tumouricidal activity, making it particularly promising. VNP20009 accumulates preferentially in tumours of mice bearing B16F10 melanoma and M019 lung carcinoma. This preferential accumulation also occurs in animals implanted sc. with human tumour xenografts …

We also found that unusual aspects of the plasmid include the inability to be completely digested with restriction endonucleases and asymmetric Phred DNA sequencing quality scores, with significantly lower scores in the forward direction relative to the colicin and immunity proteins consistent with plus (+) strand DNA. Comparing the A260 with picogreen double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fluorescence and oligreen single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fluorescence as well as metachromatic staining by acridine orange, we found that the undigested pColE3 DNA stains preferentially as ssDNA … 
David Bermudes|The role of parasites in generating evolutionary novelty|D Bermudes, Keith A Joiner|1993/12/1||9|12|458-463|Elsevier Current Trends|In this review, David Bermudes and Keith joiner discuss the interrelationship between parasitism and mutualism and examine the parallel mechanisms used by parasites and mutualists to access and persist within the intracellular environment. By drawing analogies with mutualistic associations, they suggest mechanisms by which some parasites may ultimately benefit their hosts. They further speculate that some hosts may even become dependent upon their parasites. 
David Bermudes|In vitro antagonism of bioluminescent fungi by Trichoderma harzianum|David Bermudes, Martin E Boraas, Kenneth H Nealson|1991/7/1|Mycopathologia|115|1|19-29|Kluwer Academic Publishers|Two species of bioluminescent fungi, Panellus stypticus and Omphalotus olearius were placed in contact with three different strains of interfungal pathogenic Trichoderma harzianum. Subsequent light emission by the luminous fungi and advance of the interfungal pathogens were compared. Relative differences among the pathogens were reflected in their rate of mycelial advance, the total area over which they produced spores upon the host fungi, and decreases in host bioluminescence. After ten days differences in the total surface areas of spore production varied from 1 to 53 per cent. Differences in the reduction of bioluminescence of the same material ranged over 2 orders of magnitude. Final reduction in luminescence ranged over 6 orders of magnitude. A marked reduction in bioluminescence was observed to precede the advance of spore production. The greatest reduction in luminescence was … 
Chris Bolsmann |Trade-union internationalism and solidarity in the struggle against apartheid: A Case Study of Volkswagen|Chris Bolsmann|2007/4/1|Historical Studies in Industrial Relations||23-24|103-124|Liverpool University Press|By the 1970s, the struggle against apartheid had intensified within South Africa and abroad. Eddie Webster has argued that this struggle ‘became the moral equivalent of the Spanish civil war… with democrats, liberals, communists and concerned Christians united in common abhorrence of white domination’. 1 This article focuses on the trade-union internationalism and solidarity that emerged between South African and German trade-unionists in the fight against apartheid in a major German trans-national corporation (TNC). The relationships that developed in terms of the overlapping and convergence of economic, political and institutional interests that inform actions are studied. 2 Two distinct phases are identified. First, the emergence in the latter part of the 1970s of direct shop-floor and official links between South African and German trade-unionists, informed by the economic and institutional interests of the … 
Chris Bolsmann |Globalisation, the market university and support service outsourcing in South Africa: Class struggle, convergence and difference, 1994–2001|Lucien van der Walt, Chris Bolsmann, Bernadette Johnson, Lindsey Martin|2003/7/1|Society in Transition|34|2|272-294|Taylor & Francis Group|‘Globalisation’ is all too often understood as a monolithic process that produces broadly similar outcomes in a wide range of settings. This examination of the impact of globalisation on the restructuring of public sector universities in South Africa in the 1990s demonstrates that the picture is far more complex. Over the last thirty years, globalisation has been intertwined with neoliberal capitalist economic and ideological restructuring. This is refracted, in the first instance, through State policy, and, in the second, through specific local sites of power relations and class struggles that are, in turn, structured by the resources and responses of different actors. While the neoliberal component of globalisation has played a decisive role in shaping State higher education policy in South Africa, the actual implementation of the model of the market-orientated university receiving minimal support from a deficit conscious State has … 
Chris Bolsmann |Contesting labor internationalism: The “old” trapped in the “new” in Volkswagen’s South African plant|Chris Bolsmann|2010/12|Labor Studies Journal|35|4|520-539|SAGE Publications|During the 1970s and 1980s, close linkages were established between unionists in Volkswagen’s Uitenhage plant in South Africa and Wolfsburg in Germany. The ensuing relationship resulted in trade union internationalism and solidarity with South African workers in their struggle against apartheid. After the insertion of the South African plant into the global production networks of the company, a range of new pressures and challenges confronted the union in South Africa. This resulted in the mass dismissal in 2000. In an attempt to garner international support and solidarity, the dismissed workers tapped into existing structures with no success, illustrating the reconfiguration of trade union internationalism away from worker interests to those of the unions and company. 
Chris Bolsmann |International student recruitment: South African rationales|Chris Bolsmann, Henry Miller|2008|Journal of Higher Education in Africa/Revue de l'enseignement supérieur en Afrique|6|2-3|211-231|CODESRIA|In this paper, we focus on the rationales for the recruitment of international students to universities in South Africa. Through the use of in-depth interviews with international officers at a cross-section of South African universities, we argue that there are competing and complementary rationales for the recruitment of international students. Some South African universities follow international trends in terms of international student recruitment while others adopt a different approach. The analysis locates the rationales of international student recruitment as part of an internationalisation process within the context of globalisation.
